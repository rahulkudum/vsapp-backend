satya-vratam—the Personality of Godhead, who never deviates from His vow *; satya-param—who is the Absolute Truth (as stated in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, satyaà paraà dhémahi); tri-satyam—He is always present as the Absolute Truth, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, during its maintenance, and even after its annihilation; satyasya—of all relative truths, which are emanations from the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa; yonim—the cause; nihitam—entered *; ca—and; satye—in the factors that create this material world (namely, the five elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether); satyasya—of all that is accepted as the truth; satyam—the Lord is the original truth; åta-satya-netram—He is the origin of whatever truth is pleasing (sunetram); satya-ätmakam—everything pertaining to the Lord is truth (sac-cid-änanda: His body is truth, His knowledge is truth, and His pleasure is truth); tväm—unto you, O Lord; çaraëam—offering our full surrender; prapannäù—we are completely under Your protection.
The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic manifestation—creation, maintenance and annihilation—You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antaryämé, the inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.
The demigods or devotees know perfectly well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the true substance, whether within this material world or in the spiritual world. Çrémad-Bhägavatam begins, therefore, with the words oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya . . . satyaà paraà dhémahi [SB 1.1.1]. Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is the paraà satyam, the Supreme Truth. The Supreme Truth can be approached or understood by the supreme method, as declared by the Supreme Truth: bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù (Bg. 18.55). Bhakti, devotional service, is the only way to understand the Absolute Truth. For protection, therefore, the demigods surrender to the Supreme Truth, not to the relative truth. There are persons who worship various demigods, but the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa, declares in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.23), antavat tu phalaà teñäà tad bhavaty alpa-medhasäm: "Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." Worship of demigods may be useful for a limited time, but the result is antavat, perishable. This material world is impermanent, the demigods are impermanent, and the benedictions derived from the demigods are also impermanent, whereas the living entity is eternal (nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm [Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13]). Every living entity, therefore, must search for eternal happiness, not temporary happiness. The words satyaà paraà dhémahi [SB 1.1.1] indicate that one should search for the Absolute Truth, not the relative truth.
While offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nåsiàhadeva, Prahläda Mahäräja said:
bälasya neha çaraëaà pitarau nåsiàha
närtasya cägadam udanvati majjato nauù
Generally it is understood that the protectors for a child are his parents, but this is not actually the fact. The real protector is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihäïjaseñöas
tävad vibho tanu-bhåtäà tvad-upekñitänäm
(SB 7.9.19)
If neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a child, despite the presence of his parents, will suffer, and a diseased person, despite all medical help, will die. In this material world, where there is a struggle for existence, men have invented many means for protection, but these are useless if the Supreme Personality of Godhead rejects them. Therefore the demigods purposefully say, satyätmakaà tväà çaraëaà prapannäù: "Real protection can be obtained from You, O Lord, and therefore we surrender unto You,"
The Lord demands that one surrender unto Him (sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja [Bg. 18.66]), and He further says:
sakåd eva prapanno yas
taväsméti ca yäcate
abhayaà sarvadä tasmai
dadämy etad vrataà mama
"If a person once surrenders unto Me sincerely, saying, 'My Lord, from this day I am fully surrendered unto You,' I always give him protection. That is My vow." (Rämäyaëa, Yuddha-käëòa 12.20) The demigods offered their prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He had now appeared in the womb of His devotee Devaké to protect all the devotees harassed by Kaàsa and his lieutenants. Thus the Lord acts as satyavrata. The protection given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to the protection given by the demigods. It is said that Rävaëa was a great devotee of Lord Çiva, but when Lord Rämacandra went to kill him, Lord Çiva could not give him protection.
Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, accompanied by great sages like Närada and followed by many other demigods, had now invisibly appeared in the house of Kaàsa. They began to pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in select prayers which are very pleasing to the devotees and which award fulfillment of devotional desires. The first words they spoke acclaimed that the Lord is true to His vow. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, Kåñëa descends to this material world just to protect the pious and destroy the impious. That is His vow. The demigods could understand that the Lord had taken His residence within the womb of Devaké to fulfill this vow. They were very glad that the Lord was appearing in order to fulfill His mission, and they addressed Him as satyaà param, or the Supreme Absolute Truth.
Everyone is searching after the truth. That is the philosophical way of life. The demigods give information that the Supreme Absolute Truth is Kåñëa. One who becomes fully Kåñëa conscious can attain the Absolute Truth. Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth. Relative truth is not truth in all the three phases of eternal time. Time is divided into past, present and future. Kåñëa is Truth always, past, present and future. In the material world, everything is being controlled by supreme time, in the course of past, present and future. But before the creation, Kåñëa was existing, and when there is creation, everything is resting in Kåñëa, and when this creation is finished, Kåñëa will remain. Therefore, He is the Absolute Truth in all circumstances. If there is any truth within this material world, it emanates from the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa. If there is any opulence within this material world, the cause of the opulence is Kåñëa. If there is any reputation within this material world, the cause of the reputation is Kåñëa. If there is any strength within this material world, the cause of such strength is Kåñëa. If there is any wisdom and education within this material world, the cause of such wisdom and education is Kåñëa. Therefore Kåñëa is the source of all relative truths.
Devotees, therefore, following in the footsteps of Lord Brahmä, pray, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi **, worshiping the ädi-puruña, the supreme truth, Govinda. Everything, everywhere, is performed in terms of three principles, jïäna-bala-kriyä—knowledge, strength and activity. In every field, if there is not full knowledge, full strength and full activity, an endeavor is never successful. Therefore, if one wants success in everything, one must be backed by these three principles. In the Vedas (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.8) there is this statement about the Supreme Personality of Godhead:
na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate
na tat samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate
paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate
sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca
 [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to do anything personally, for He has such potencies that anything He wants done will be done perfectly well through the control of the material nature (sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca). Similarly, those who are engaged in the service of the Lord are not meant to struggle for existence. The devotees who are fully engaged in spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement, more than ten thousand men and women all over the world, have no steady or permanent occupation, yet we actually see that they are maintained very opulently. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.22):
ananyäç cintayanto mäà
ye janäù paryupäsate
teñäà nityäbhiyuktänäà
yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham
"Those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form—to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have." The devotees have no anxiety over what will happen next, where they will stay or what they will eat, for everything is maintained and supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised, kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati: "O son of Kunté, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes." (Bg. 9.31) From all angles of vision, therefore, in all circumstances, if one fully surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of one's struggling for existence. In this connection, the commentary by Çrépäda Madhväcärya, who quotes from the Tantra-bhägavata, is very meaningful:
sac-chadba uttamaà brüyäd
änandantéti vai vadet
yetijïänaà samuddiñöaà
pürëänanda-dåçis tataù

.   .   .
attåtväc ca tadä dänät
satyättya cocyate vibhuù
Explaining the words satyasya yonim, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that Kåñëa is the avatäré, the origin of all incarnations. All incarnations are the Absolute Truth, yet the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa is the origin of all incarnations. Dépärcir eva hi daçäntaram abhyupetya dépäyate (Bs. 5.46). There may be many lamps, all equal in power, yet there is a first lamp, a second lamp, a third lamp and so on. Similarly, there are many incarnations, who are compared to lamps, but the first lamp, the original Personality of Godhead, is Kåñëa. Govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi **.
The demigods must offer worship in obedience to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one might argue that since the Supreme Godhead was within the womb of Devaké, He was also coming in a material body. Why then should He be worshiped? Why should one make a distinction between an ordinary living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead? These questions are answered in the following verses.

sapta-tvag añöa-viöapo naväkño
daça-cchadé dvi-khago hy ädi-våkñaù
eka-ayanaù—the body of an ordinary living being is fully dependent on the material elements; asau—that; dvi-phalaù—in this body we are subject to material happiness and distress, which result from karma; tri-mülaù—having three roots, the three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), upon which the body is created;  catuù-rasaù—four rasas, or tastes; païca-vidhaù—consisting of five senses for acquiring knowledge (the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch); ñaö-ätmä—six circumstances (lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst); sapta-tvak—having seven coverings (skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen); añöa-viöapaù—eight branches (the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and also the mind, intelligence and ego); nava-akñaù—nine holes; daça-chadé—ten kinds of life air, resembling the leaves of a tree; dvi-khagaù—two birds (the individual soul and the Supersoul); hi—indeed; ädi-våkñaù -this is the original tree or construction of the material body, whether individual or universal.
The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called "the original tree." From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit—the enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association with the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four tastes—religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation—which are experienced through five senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements—earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows—the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the rectum and the genitals—and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.
This material world is composed of five principal elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—all of which are emanations from Kåñëa. Although materialistic scientists may accept these five primary elements as the cause of the material manifestation, these elements in their gross and subtle states are produced by Kåñëa, whose marginal potency also produces the living entities working within this material world. The Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä clearly states that the entire cosmic manifestation is a combination of two of Kåñëa's energies—the superior energy and the inferior energy. The living entities are the superior energy, and the inanimate material elements are His inferior energy. In the dormant stage, everything rests in Kåñëa.
Material scientists cannot give such a thorough analysis of the material structure of the body. The analysis of the material scientists concerns itself only with inanimate matter, but this is inadequate because the living entity is completely separate from the material bodily structure. In the Bhagavad-gétä (7.5) the Lord says:
apareyam itas tv anyäà
prakåtià viddhi me paräm
jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho
yayedaà dhäryate jagat
"Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature." Although the material elements emanate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, they are separated elements and are sustained by the living elements.
As indicated by the word dvi-khagaù, the living elements within the body resemble two birds in a tree. Kha means "sky," and ga means "one who flies." Thus the word dvi-khagaù refers to birds. In the tree of the body there are two birds, or two living elements, and they are always different. In the Bhagavad-gétä (13.3), the Lord says, kñetra-jïaà cäpi mäà viddhi sarva-kñetreñu bhärata: "O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies." The kñetra-jïa, the individual knower of the body, is also called the khaga, the living entity. Within the body there are two such kñetra-jïas—the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is the knower of his individual body, but the Supersoul is present within the bodies of all living entities. Such a thorough analysis and understanding of the bodily structure cannot be obtained anywhere but in the Vedic literature.
When two birds enter a tree, one may foolishly think that the birds become one or merge with the tree, but actually they do not. Rather, each bird keeps its individual identity. Similarly, the individual soul and the Supersoul do not become one, nor do they merge with matter. The living entity lives close to matter, but this does not mean that he merges or mixes with it (asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù), although material scientists mistakenly see the organic and inorganic, or animate and inanimate, to be mixed.
Vedic knowledge has been kept imprisoned or concealed, but every human being needs to understand it in truth. The modern civilization of ignorance is simply engaged in analyzing the body, and thus people come to the erroneous conclusion that the living force within the body is generated under certain material conditions. People have no information of the soul, but this verse gives the perfect explanation that there are two living forces (dvi-khaga): the individual soul and the Supersoul. The Supersoul is present in every body (éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati [Bg. 18.61]), whereas the individual soul is situated only in his own body (dehé) and is transmigrating from one body to another.

tvam—You (O Lord); ekaù—being one without a second, You are everything; eva—indeed; asya sataù—of this cosmic manifestation now visible; prasütiù—the original source; tvam—Your Lordship; sannidhänam—the conservation of all such energy when everything is annihilated; tvam—Your Lordship; anugrahaù ca—and the maintainer; tvat-mäyayä—by Your illusory, external energy; saàvåta-cetasaù—those whose intelligence is covered by such illusory energy; tväm—unto You; paçyanti—observe; nänä—many varieties; na—not; vipaçcitaù—learned scholars or devotees; ye—who are.
The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord. You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is not the vision of learned devotees.
Various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and even Viñëu, are supposed to be the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world, but actually they are not. The fact is that everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, manifested in varieties of energy. Ekam evädvitéyaà brahma. There is no second existence. Those who are truly vipaçcit, learned, are those who have reached the platform of understanding and observing the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition of life. premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti (Bs. 5.38). Learned devotees accept even conditions of distress as representing the presence of the Supreme Lord. When a devotee is in distress, he sees that the Lord has appeared as distress just to relieve or purify the devotee from the contamination of the material world. While one is within this material world, one is in various conditions, and therefore a devotee sees a condition of distress as but another feature of the Lord. Tat te'nukampäà susamékñamäëaù (SB 10.14.8). A devotee, therefore, regards distress as a great favor of the Lord because he understands that he is being cleansed of contamination. Teñäm ahaà samuddhartä måtyu-saàsära-sägarät (Bg. 12.7). The appearance of distress is a negative process intended to give the devotee relief from this material world, which is called måtyu-saàsära, or the constant repetition of birth and death. To save a surrendered soul from repeated birth and death, the Lord purifies him of contamination by offering him a little distress. This cannot be understood by a nondevotee, but a devotee can see this because he is vipaçcit, or learned. A nondevotee, therefore, is perturbed in distress, but a devotee welcomes distress as another feature of the Lord. Sarvaà khalv idaà brahma. A devotee can actually see that there is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead and no second entity. Ekam evädvitéyam. There is only the Lord, who presents Himself in different energies.
Persons who are not in real knowledge think that Brahmä is the creator, Viñëu the maintainer and Çiva the annihilator and that the different demigods are intended to fulfill diverse purposes. Thus they create diverse purposes and worship various demigods to have these purposes fulfilled (kämais tais tair håta jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù [Bg. 7.20]). A devotee, however, knows that these various demigods are but different parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that these parts need not be worshiped. As the Lord says in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.23):
ye 'py anya-devatä bhaktä
yajante çraddhayänvitäù
te 'pi mäm eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-pürvakam
"Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunti, but they do so in a wrong way." There is no need to worship the demigods, for this is avidhi, not in order. Simply by surrendering oneself at the lotus feet of Kåñëa, one can completely discharge one's duties; there is no need to worship various deities or demigods. These various divinities are observed by the müòhas, fools, who are bewildered by the three modes of material nature (tribhir guëamayair bhävair ebhiù sarvam idaà jagat). Such fools cannot understand that the real source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (mohitaà näbhijänäti mäm ebhyaù param avyayam [Bg. 7.13]). Not being disturbed by the Lord's various features, one should concentrate upon and worship the Supreme Lord (mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja). This should be the guiding principle of one's life.

O Lord, You are always in full knowledge, and to bring all good fortune to all living entities, You appear in different incarnations, all of them transcendental to the material creation. When You appear in these incarnations, You are pleasing to the pious and religious devotees, but for nondevotees You are the annihilator.
This verse explains why the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as an incarnation again and again. The incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead all function differently, but their main purpose is pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm [Bg. 4.8]—to protect the devotees and annihilate the miscreants. Yet even though the duñkåtés, or miscreants, are annihilated, this is ultimately good for them.

tvayi—in You; ambuja-akña—O lotus-eyed Lord; akhila-sattva-dhämni—who are the original cause of all existence, from whom everything emanates and in whom all potencies reside; samädhinä—by constant meditation and complete absorption (in thoughts of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead); äveçita—fully absorbed, fully engaged; cetasä—but by such a mentality; eke—the one process of always thinking of Your lotus feet; tvat-päda-potena—by boarding such a boat as Your lotus feet; mahat-kåtena—by that action which is considered the most powerful original existence or which is executed by mahäjanas; kurvanti—they make; govatsa-padam—like the hoofprint of a calf; bhava-abdhim—the great ocean of nescience.
O lotus-eyed Lord, by concentrating one's meditation on Your lotus feet, which are the reservoir of all existence, and by accepting those lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of mahäjanas [great saints, sages and devotees]. By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.
The true mission in life is to cross the ocean of nescience, of repeated birth and death. Those in the darkness of ignorance, however, do not know this mission. Instead, being carried away by the waves of material nature (prakåteù kriyamäëäni guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù [Bg. 3.27]), they are undergoing the tribulations of måtyu-saàsära-vartmani [Bg. 9.3], repeated birth and death. But a person who has achieved knowledge by the association of devotees follows the mahäjanas (mahat-kåtena). Such a person always concentrates his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord and executes one or more of the nine varieties of devotional service (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam [SB 7.5.23]). Simply by this process, one can cross the insurmountable ocean of nescience.
Devotional service is powerful in any form. Çré-viñëoù çravaëe parékñid abhavad vaiyäsakiù kértane (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.265). According to this verse, Mahäräja Parékñit became liberated by fully concentrating his mind on hearing the Lord's holy name, attributes and pastimes. Similarly, Çukadeva Gosvämé simply glorified the Lord, and by speaking on the subject matters of Kåñëa that constitute the entire Çrémad-Bhägavatam, he too was liberated. One may also be liberated simply by sakhya, friendly behavior with the Lord. Such is the power of devotional service, as we learn from the examples set by the Lord's many pure devotees.
svayambhür näradaù çambhuù
kumäraù kapilo manuù
prahlädo janako bhéñmo
balir vaiyäsakir vayam
 [SB 6.3.20]
We have to follow in the footsteps of such devotees, for by this one easy process one can cross the great ocean of nescience just as one might cross a small hole created by the hoof of a calf.
Here the Lord is described as ambujäkña, or lotus-eyed. By seeing the eyes of the Lord, which are compared to lotus flowers, one becomes so satisfied that one does not want to turn his eyes to anything else. Simply by seeing the transcendental form of the Lord, a devotee is at once fully absorbed in the Lord in his heart. This absorption is called samädhi. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù (SB 12.13.1). A yogé is fully absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he has no other business than to think of the Lord always within the heart. It is also said:
samäçritä ye pada-pallava-plavaà
mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù
bhavämbudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà
padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm
"For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Muräri, the enemy of the demon Mura, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoofprint. His goal is paraà padam, or Vaikuëöha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step." (SB 10.14.58) This process is recommended here by authorities like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva (svayambhür näradaù çambhuù [SB 6.3.20]), and therefore we must take to this process in order to transcend nescience. This is very easy, but we must follow in the footsteps of great personalities, and then success will be possible.
In regard to the word mahat-kåtena, it is also significant that the process shown by great devotees is not exclusively for them but is also for others. If things are made easy, this affords facility for the person who has made them easy and also for others who follow the same principles. The process recommended in this verse for crossing the ocean of nescience is easy not only for the devotee but also for common persons who follow the devotee (mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù [Cc. Madhya 17.186]).

svayam—personally; samuttérya—perfectly crossing; su-dustaram—which is very difficult to cross; dyuman—O Lord, who appear exactly like the sun, illuminating the darkness of this world of ignorance; bhava-arëavam—the ocean of nescience; bhémam—which is extremely fierce; adabhra-sauhådäù—devotees who are incessantly friendly to the fallen souls; bhavat-pada-ambhoruha—Your lotus feet; nävam—the boat for crossing; atra—in this world; te—they (the Vaiñëavas); nidhäya—leaving behind; yätäù—on to the ultimate destination, Vaikuëöha; sat-anugrahaù—who are always kind and merciful to the devotees; bhavän—You.
O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore You are known as a desire tree [väïchä-kalpataru]. When äcäryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.
This statement reveals how the merciful äcäryas and the merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead together help the serious devotee who wants to return home, back to Godhead. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in His teachings to Rüpa Gosvämé, said:
brahmäëòa bhramite kona bhägyavän jéva
guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
One can achieve the seed of bhakti-latä, devotional service, by the mercy of guru and Kåñëa. The duty of the guru is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to render devotional service, which Kåñëa accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks shelter of such a guru, or äcärya, who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The äcärya's duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees may render service according to references from çästra. Rüpa Gosvämé, for example, in order to help subsequent devotees, published such devotional books as Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu. Thus it is the duty of the äcärya to publish books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities—illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling—and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Haridäsa Öhäkura but should follow this method. Kåñëa will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The äcärya gives the suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called äcärya-sampradäya. It is therefore said, sampradäya-vihénä ye manträs te niñphalä matäù (Padma Puräëa). The äcärya-sampradäya is strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the äcärya-sampradäya; otherwise one's endeavor will be futile. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura therefore sings:
täìdera caraëa sevi bhakta sane väsa
janame janame haya, ei abhiläña
One must worship the lotus feet of the äcärya and live within the society of devotees. Then one's endeavor to cross over nescience will surely be successful.

[Someone may say that aside from devotees, who always seek shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, there are those who are not devotees but who have accepted different processes for attaining salvation. What happens to them? In answer to this question, Lord Brahmä and the other demigods said:] O lotus-eyed Lord, although nondevotees who accept severe austerities and penances to achieve the highest position may think themselves liberated, their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because they have no regard for Your lotus feet.
Aside from devotees, there are many others, nondevotees, known as karmés, jïänés or yogés, philanthropists, altruists, politicians, impersonalists and voidists. There are many varieties of nondevotees who have their respective ways of liberation, but simply because they do not know the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, although they falsely think that they have been liberated and elevated to the highest position, they fall down. As clearly stated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.3):
açraddadhänäù puruñä
dharmasyäsya parantapa
apräpya mäà nivartante
måtyu-saàsära-vartmani
"Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world." It doesn't matter whether one is a karmé, jïäné, yogé, philanthropist, politician or whatever; if one has no love for the lotus feet of the Lord, one falls down. That is the verdict given by Lord Brahmä in this verse.
There are persons who advocate accepting any process and who say that whatever process one accepts will lead to the same goal, but that is refuted in this verse, where such persons are referred to as vimukta-mäninaù, signifying that although they think they have attained the highest perfection, in fact they have not. In the present day, big, big politicians all over the world think that by scheming they can occupy the highest political post, that of president or prime minister, but we actually see that even in this life such big prime ministers, presidents and other politicians, because of being nondevotees, fall down (patanty adhaù). To become president or prime minister is not easy; one must work very hard (äruhya kåcchreëa) to achieve the post. And even though one may reach his goal, at any moment one may be kicked down by material nature. In human society there have been many instances in which great, exalted politicians have fallen from government and become lost in historical oblivion. The cause of this is aviçuddha-buddhayaù: [SB 10.2.32] their intelligence is impure. The çästra says, na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum (SB 7.5.31). One achieves the perfection of life by becoming a devotee of Viñëu, but people do not know this. Therefore, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (12.5), kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm. Persons who do not ultimately accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead and take to devotional service, but who instead are attached to impersonalism and voidism, must undergo great labor to achieve their goals.
çreyaù-såtià bhaktim udasya te vibho
kliçyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
(SB 10.14.4)
To achieve understanding, such persons work very hard and undergo severe austerities, but their hard labor and austerities themselves are their only achievement, for they do not actually achieve the real goal of life.
Dhruva Mahäräja at first wanted to achieve the greatest material kingdom and greater material possessions than his father, but when he was actually favored by the Lord, who appeared before him to give him the benediction he desired, Dhruva Mahäräja refused it, saying, svämin kåtärtho'smi varaà na yäce: [Cc. Madhya 22.42] "Now I am fully satisfied. I do not want any material benediction." (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 7.28) This is the perfection of life. Yaà labdhvä cäparaà läbhaà manyate nädhikaà tataù (Bg. 6.22). If one achieves the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, one is fully satisfied and does not need to ask for any material benediction.
At night, no one can see a lotus, for lotuses blossom only during the daytime. Therefore the word aravindäkña is significant. One who is not captivated by the lotus eyes or transcendental form of the Supreme Lord is in darkness, exactly like one who cannot see a lotus. One who has not come to the point of seeing the lotus eyes and transcendental form of Çyämasundara is a failure. Premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti [Bs. 5.38]. Those who are attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in love always see the Lord's lotus eyes and lotus feet, whereas others cannot see the Lord's beauty and are therefore classified as anädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù, or neglectful of the Lord's personal form. Those who neglect the Lord's form are surely failures on every path in life, but if one develops even a little love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is liberated without difficulty (svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät). Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead recommends in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.34), man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru: [Bg. 18.65] "Simply think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer some slight homage to Me." Simply by this process, one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, and thus attain the highest perfection. The Lord further affirms in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.54-55):
brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä
na çocati na käìkñati
samaù sarveñu bhüteñu
mad-bhaktià labhate paräm
bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti
yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù
tato mäà tattvato jïätvä
viçate tad-anantaram
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me. One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."

O Mädhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.
Devotees generally do not fall down, but if circumstantially they do, the Lord, because of their strong attachment to Him, gives them protection in all circumstances. Thus even if devotees fall down, they are still strong enough to traverse the heads of their enemies. We have actually seen that our Kåñëa consciousness movement has many opponents, such as the "deprogrammers," who instituted a strong legal case against the devotees. We thought that this case would take a long time to settle, but because the devotees were protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we unexpectedly won the case in one day. Thus a case that was expected to continue for years was settled in a day because of the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.31), kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati: "O son of Kunté, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes." In history there are many instances of devotees like Citraketu, Indradyumna and Mahäräja Bharata who circumstantially fell down but were still protected. Mahäräja Bharata, for example, because of his attachment to a deer, thought of the deer at the time of death, and therefore in his next life he became a deer (yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà tyajaty ante kalevaram [Bg. 8.6]). Because of protection by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the deer remembered his relationship with the Lord and next took birth in a good brahminical family and performed devotional service (çucénäà çrématäà gehe yoga-bhrañöo 'bhijäyate [Bg. 6.41]). Similarly, Citraketu fell down and became a demon, Våträsura, but he too was protected. Thus even if one falls down from the path of bhakti-yoga, one is ultimately saved. If a devotee is strongly situated in devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has promised to protect him (kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati [Bg. 9.31]). But even if a devotee circumstantially falls down, he is protected by Mädhava.
The word Mädhava is significant. Mä, Mother Lakñmé, the mother of all opulences, is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if a devotee is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the opulences of the Lord are ready to help him.
yatra yogeçvaraù kåñëo
yatra pärtho dhanur-dharaù
tatra çrér vijayo bhütir
dhruvä nétir matir mama
(Bg. 18.78)
Wherever there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, along with His devotee Arjuna, Pärtha, there is victory, opulence, extraordinary power and morality. The opulences of a devotee are not a result of karma-käëòa-vicära. A devotee is always protected by all of the Supreme Lord's opulences, of which no one can deprive him (teñäà nityäbhiyuktänäà yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham [Bg. 9.22]). Thus a devotee cannot be defeated by any opponents. A devotee, therefore, should not deviate knowingly from the path of devotion. The adherent devotee is assured all protection by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

O Lord, during the time of maintenance You manifest several incarnations, all with transcendental bodies, beyond the material modes of nature. When You appear in this way, You bestow all good fortune upon the living entities by teaching them to perform Vedic activities such as ritualistic ceremonies, mystic yoga, austerities, penances, and ultimately samädhi, ecstatic absorption in thoughts of You. Thus You are worshiped by the Vedic principles.
As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.3), yajïa-däna-tapaù-karma na tyäjyam: the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, charity, austerity and all such prescribed duties are never to be given up. Yajïo dänaà tapaç caiva pävanäni manéñiëäm (18.5): even one who is very much advanced in spiritual realization must still execute the Vedic principles. Even in the lowest stage, the karmés are advised to work for the sake of the Lord.
yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra
loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù
"Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work causes bondage in this material world." (Bg. 3.9) The words yajïärthät karmaëaù indicate that while performing all kinds of duties one should remember that these duties should be performed to satisfy the Supreme Lord (sva-karmaëä tam abhyarcya [Bg. 18.46]). According to Vedic principles, there must be divisions of human society (cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöam [Bg. 4.13]). There should be brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras, and everyone should learn to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tam abhyarcya). This is real human society, and without this system we are left with animal society.
The modern activities of human society are described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam as the activities of go-khara, cows and asses (sa eva go-kharaù [SB 10.84.13]). Everyone is acting in a bodily concept of life involving society, friendship and love for the improvement of economic and political conditions, and thus all activities are enacted in ignorance. The Supreme Personality therefore comes to teach us how to act according to the Vedic principles. In this Age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and preached that in this age the Vedic activities cannot be systematically performed because people are so fallen. He gave this recommendation from the çästras:
harer näma harer näma
harer nämaiva kevalam
kalau nästy eva nästy eva
nästy eva gatir anyathä
 [Cc. Ädi 17.21]
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." The Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore teaching people all over the world how to chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, and this has proved very effective in all places at all times. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in order to teach us Vedic principles intended for understanding Him (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]). We should always know that when Kåñëa and Lord Caitanya appeared, They appeared in çuddha-sattva bodies. One should not mistake the body of Kåñëa or Caitanya Mahäprabhu to be a material body like ours, for Kåñëa and Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared as needed for the benefit of the entire human society. Out of causeless mercy, the Lord appears in different ages in His original çuddha-sattva transcendental body to elevate human society to the spiritual platform, from which they can truly benefit. Unfortunately, modern politicians and other leaders stress the bodily comforts of life (yasyätma-buddhiù kuëape tri-dhätuke [SB 10.84.13]) and concentrate on the activities of this ism and that ism, which they describe in different kinds of flowery language. Essentially such activities are the activities of animals (sa eva go-kharaù [SB 10.84.13]). We should learn how to act from Bhagavad-gétä, which explains everything for human understanding. Thus we can become happy even in this Age of Kali.

O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.
It is said, trai-guëya-viñayä vedä nistrai-guëyo bhavärjuna. Unless one is situated in transcendence, one cannot understand the transcendental nature of the Lord. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.14.29):
athäpi te deva padämbuja-dvaya-
prasäda-leçänugåhéta eva hi
jänäti tattvaà bhagavan-mahimno
na cänya eko 'pi ciraà vicinvan
Only by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can one understand Him. Those who are in the modes of material nature, although speculating for thousands of years, cannot understand Him. The Lord has innumerable forms (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan [Bs. 5.39]), and unless these forms, such as Lord Rämacandra, Nåsiàhadeva, Kåñëa and Balaräma, are transcendental, why would they be worshiped by devotees since time immemorial? Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù (Bg. 18.55). Devotees who awaken their transcendental nature in the presence of the Lord and who follow the rules and regulations of devotional service can understand Lord Kåñëa, Lord Rämacandra and other incarnations, who are not of this material world but who come from the spiritual world for the benefit of people in general. If one does not take to this process, one imagines or manufactures some form of God according to material qualities and can never awaken a real understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù signify that unless one worships the Lord according to the regulative devotional principles, one cannot awaken the transcendental nature. Deity worship, even in the absence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, awakens the transcendental nature of the devotee, who thus becomes increasingly attached to the Lord's lotus feet.
The appearance of Kåñëa is the answer to all imaginative iconography of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone imagines the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to his mode of material nature. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that the Lord is the oldest person. Therefore a section of religionists imagine that God must be very old, and therefore they depict a form of the Lord like a very old man. But in the same Brahma-saàhitä, that is contradicted: although He is the oldest of all living entities, He has His eternal form as a fresh youth. The exact words used in this connection in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam are vijïänam ajïäna-bhidäpamärjanam. Vijïäna means transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality; vijïäna is also experienced knowledge. Transcendental knowledge has to be accepted by the descending process of disciplic succession as Brahmä presents the knowledge of Kåñëa in the Brahma-saàhitä. The Brahma-saàhitä is vijïäna as realized by Brahmä's transcendental experience, and in that way he presented the form and the pastimes of Kåñëa in the transcendental abode. Ajïäna-bhidä means "that which can match all kinds of speculation." In ignorance, people are imagining the form of the Lord; sometimes He has no form and sometimes He has form, according to their different imaginations. But the presentation of Kåñëa in the Brahma-saàhitä is vijïäna—scientific, experienced knowledge given by Lord Brahmä and accepted by Lord Caitanya. There is no doubt about it. Çré Kåñëa's form, Çré Kåñëa's flute, Kåñëa's color—everything is reality. Here it is said that this vijïänam is always defeating all kinds of speculative knowledge. "Therefore," the demigods prayed, "without Your appearing as Kåñëa, as You are, neither ajïäna-bhidä (the nescience of speculative knowledge) nor vijïänam would be realized. Ajïäna-bhidäpamärjanam—by Your appearance the speculative knowledge of ignorance will be vanquished, and the real, experienced knowledge of authorities like Lord Brahmä will be established. Men influenced by the three modes of material nature imagine their own God according to the modes of material nature. In this way God is presented in various ways, but Your appearance will establish what the real form of God is."
The greatest blunder committed by the impersonalist is to think that when the incarnation of God comes He accepts a form of matter in the mode of goodness. Actually, the form of Kåñëa or Näräyaëa is transcendental to any material idea. Even the greatest impersonalist, Çaìkaräcärya, has admitted, näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät: the material creation is caused by the avyakta, the impersonal manifestation of matter or the nonphenomenal total reservoir of matter, and Kåñëa is transcendental to that material conception. This is expressed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as çuddha-sattva, or transcendental. The Lord does not belong to the material mode of goodness, for He is above the position of material goodness. He belongs to the transcendental, eternal status of bliss and knowledge.
"Dear Lord," the demigods prayed, "when You appear in Your different incarnations, You take different names and forms according to different situations. Lord Kåñëa is Your name because You are all-attractive; You are called Çyämasundara because of Your transcendental beauty. Çyäma means blackish, yet they say that You are more beautiful than thousands of Cupids. Kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya. Although You appear in a color which is compared to that of a blackish cloud, You are the transcendental Absolute, and therefore Your beauty is many, many times more attractive than the delicate body of Cupid. Sometimes You are called Giridhäré because You lifted the hill known as Govardhana. You are sometimes called Nanda-nandana or Väsudeva or Devaké-nandana because You appear as the son of Mahäräja Nanda or Devaké or Vasudeva. Impersonalists think that Your many names or forms are according to a particular type of work and quality because they accept You from the position of a material observer.
"Our dear Lord, the way of understanding You is not to study Your absolute nature, form and activities by mental speculation. One must engage himself in devotional service; then one can understand Your absolute nature and Your transcendental form, name and qualities. Actually, only a person who has a little taste for the service of Your lotus feet can understand Your transcendental nature or form and qualities. Others may go on speculating for millions of years, but it is not possible for them to understand even a single part of Your actual position." In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, cannot be understood by the nondevotees because there is a curtain of yogamäyä which covers Kåñëa's actual features. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.25), nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya. The Lord says, "I am not exposed to anyone and everyone." When Kåñëa came, He was actually present on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, and everyone saw Him. But not everyone could understand that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, everyone who died in His presence attained complete liberation from material bondage and was transferred to the spiritual world.
Because foolish müòhas do not awaken their spiritual nature, they do not understand Kåñëa or Räma (avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam [Bg. 9.11]). Even big academic scholars, not considering the endeavors of the äcäryas who have recommended devotional service in many elaborate commentaries and notes, think that Kåñëa is fictitious. This is due to a lack of transcendental knowledge and a failure to awaken Kåñëa consciousness. One should have the common sense to ask why, if Kåñëa or Räma were fictitious, stalwart scholars like Çrédhara Svämé, Rüpa Gosvämé, Sanätana Gosvämé, Véraräghava, Vijayadhvaja, Vallabhäcärya and many other recognized äcäryas would have spent so much time to write about Kåñëa in notes and commentaries on Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

O Lord, Your transcendental name and form are not ascertained by those who merely speculate on the path of imagination. Your name, form and attributes can be ascertained only through devotional service.
As stated in the Padma Puräëa:
ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi
na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù
sevonmukhe hi jihvädau
svayam eva sphuraty adaù
 [Cc. Madhya 17.136]
"One cannot understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, qualities and pastimes of Çré Kåñëa through one's materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him." Since Kåñëa and His transcendental name, form and activities are all of a transcendental nature, ordinary persons or those who are only slightly advanced cannot understand them. Even big scholars who are nondevotees think that Kåñëa is fictitious. Yet although so-called scholars and commentators do not believe that Kåñëa was factually a historical person whose presence on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra is recorded in the history known as the Mahäbhärata, they feel compelled to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-gétä and other historical records. Sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù: [Brs.  1.2.234] Kåñëa's transcendental name, form, attributes and activities can be revealed only when one engages in His service in full consciousness. This confirms Kåñëa's own words in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.55):
bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti
yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù
tato mäà tattvato jïätvä
viçate tad-anantaram
"One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God." Only by sevonmukha, by engaging oneself in the Lord's service, can one realize the name, form and qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
"O Lord," the demigods say, "the impersonalists, who are nondevotees, cannot understand that Your name is identical with Your form." Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference between His name and His actual form. In the material world there is a difference between form and name. The mango fruit is different from the name of the mango. One cannot taste the mango fruit simply by chanting, "Mango, mango, mango." But the devotee who knows that there is no difference between the name and the form of the Lord chants Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and realizes that he is always in Kåñëa's company.
For persons who are not very advanced in absolute knowledge of the Supreme, Lord Kåñëa exhibits His transcendental pastimes. They can simply think of the pastimes of the Lord and get the full benefit. Since there is no difference between the transcendental name and form of the Lord, there is no difference between the transcendental pastimes and the form of the Lord. For those who are less intelligent (like women, laborers or the mercantile class), the great sage Vyäsadeva wrote the Mahäbhärata. In the Mahäbhärata, Kåñëa is present in His different activities. The Mahäbhärata is history, and simply by studying, hearing, and memorizing the transcendental activities of Kåñëa, the less intelligent can also gradually rise to the standard of pure devotees.
The pure devotees, who are always absorbed in the thought of the transcendental lotus feet of Kåñëa and who are always engaged in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, are never to be considered to be in the material world. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has explained that those who are always engaged in Kåñëa consciousness by body, mind and activities are to be considered liberated even within this body. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä: those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord have already transcended the material position.
Kåñëa appears in order to give both the devotees and the nondevotees a chance for realization of the ultimate goal of life. The devotees get the direct chance to see Him and worship Him. Those who are not on that platform get the chance to become acquainted with His activities and thus become elevated to the same position.
The Brahma-saàhitä (5.38) says:
premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti
yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
Although Kåñëa's transcendental form is presented as black, devotees who are in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead appreciate the Lord as Çyämasundara, having a very beautiful blackish form. The Lord's form is so beautiful that the Brahma-saàhitä (5.30) also states:
veëuà kvaëantam aravinda-daläyatäkñaà
barhävataàsam asitämbuda-sundaräìgam
kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya-viçeña-çobhaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who plays on His transcendental flute. His eyes are like lotus flowers, He is decorated with peacock plumes, and His bodily color resembles the color of a fresh black cloud, His bodily features are more beautiful than millions of Cupids." This beauty of the Supreme Lord can be seen by devotees who are in love with Him, devotees whose eyes are anointed with love of Godhead (premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena [Bs. 5.38]).
The Lord is also known as Giridhäré or Girivara-dhäré. Because Kåñëa, for the sake of His devotees, lifted Govardhana Hill, the devotees appreciate the Lord's inconceivable strength; but nondevotees, in spite of directly perceiving the Lord's inconceivable strength and power, regard the Lord's activities as fictitious. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. Nondevotees cannot give any nomenclature for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet the Lord is known as Çyämasundara and Giridhäré. Similarly, the Lord is known as Devaké-nandana and Yaçodä-nandana because He accepted the role of son for Mother Devaké and Mother Yaçodä, and He is known as Gopäla because He enjoyed the sport of maintaining the cows and calves. Therefore, although He has no mundane name, He is addressed by devotees as Devaké-nandana, Yaçodä-nandana, Gopäla and Çyämasundara. These are all transcendental names that only devotees can appreciate and nondevotees cannot.
The history of Kåñëa the person has been openly seen by everyone, yet only those who are in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead can appreciate this history, whereas nondevotees, who have not developed their loving qualities, think that the activities, form and attributes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are fictitious. Therefore this verse explains, na näma-rüpe guëa janma-karmabhir nirüpitavye tava tasya säkñiëaù. In this connection, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given the example that persons suffering from jaundice cannot taste the sweetness of sugar candy, although everyone knows that sugar candy is sweet. Similarly, because of the material disease, nondevotees cannot understand the transcendental name, form, attributes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although they actually see the Lord's activities, either through authority or through history. The Puräëas are old, authentic histories, but nondevotees cannot understand them, especially Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is the essence of Vedic knowledge. Nondevotees cannot understand even the preliminary study of transcendental knowledge, the Bhagavad-gétä. They simply speculate and present commentaries with absurd distortions. In conclusion, unless one elevates himself to the transcendental platform by practicing bhakti-yoga, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His name, form, attributes or activities. But if by chance, by the association of devotees, one can actually understand the Lord and His features, one immediately becomes a liberated person. As the Lord says in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evaà yo vetti tattvataù
tyaktvä dehaà punar janma
naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has therefore said that by affection and love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, devotees can express their mind to Him with their words. Others, however, cannot do this, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù [Bg. 18.55]).

çåëvan—constantly hearing about the Lord (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù); gåëan—chanting or reciting (the holy name of the Lord and His activities); saàsmarayan—remembering (constantly thinking of the Lord's lotus feet and His form); ca—and; cintayan—contemplating (the transcendental activities of the Lord); nämäni—His transcendental names; rüpäëi—His transcendental forms; ca—also; maìgaläni—which are all transcendental and therefore auspicious; te—of Your Lordship; kriyäsu—in being engaged in the devotional service; yaù—he who; tvat-caraëa-aravindayoù—at Your lotus feet; äviñöa-cetäù—the devotee who is completely absorbed (in such activities); na—not; bhaväya—for the material platform; kalpate—is fit.
Even while engaged in various activities, devotees whose minds are completely absorbed at Your lotus feet, and who constantly hear, chant, contemplate and cause others to remember Your transcendental names and forms, are always on the transcendental platform, and thus they can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
How bhakti-yoga can be practiced is explained in this verse. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has said that anyone who has dedicated his life to the service of the Lord (éhä yasya harer däsye) by his activities, his mind and his words (karmaëä manasä girä) may stay in any condition of life (nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu) and yet is no longer actually conditioned but is liberated (jévan-muktaù sa ucyate). Even though such a devotee is in a material body, he has nothing to do with this body, for he is transcendentally situated. Näräyaëa-paräù sarve na kutaçcana bibhyati: because a devotee is engaged in transcendental activities, he is not afraid of being materially embodied. (SB 6.17.28) Illustrating this liberated position, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu prayed, mama janmani janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi: [Cc. Antya 20.29, Çikñäñöaka 4] "All I want is Your causeless devotional service in My life, birth after birth." Even if a devotee, by the supreme will of the Lord, takes birth in this material world, he continues his devotional service. When King Bharata made a mistake and in his next life became a deer, his devotional service did not stop, although some slight chastisement was given to him because of his negligence. Närada Muni says that even if one falls from the platform of devotional service, he is not lost, whereas nondevotees are lost entirely because they are not engaged in service. The Bhagavad-gétä (9.14) therefore recommends that one always engage at least in chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra:
satataà kértayanto mäà
yatantaç ca dåòha-vratäù
namasyantaç ca mäà bhaktyä
nitya-yuktä upäsate
"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."
One should not give up the process of devotional service, which is performed in nine different ways (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam, etc. [SB 7.5.23]). The most important process is hearing (çravaëam) from the guru, sädhu and çästra—the spiritual master, the saintly äcäryas and the Vedic literature. Sädhu-çästra-guru-väkya, cittete kariyä aikya. We should not hear the commentaries and explanations of nondevotees, for this is strictly forbidden by Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, who quotes from the Padma Puräëa:
avaiñëava-mukhodgérëaà
pütaà hari-kathämåtam
çravaëaà naiva kartavyaà
sarpocchiñöaà yathä payaù
"One should not hear anything about Kåñëa from a non-Vaiñëava. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Kåñëa given by a non-Vaiñëava are also poisonous." We should strictly follow this injunction and never try to hear from Mäyävädés, impersonalists, voidists, politicians or so-called scholars. Strictly avoiding such inauspicious association, we should simply hear from pure devotees. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé therefore recommends, çré-guru-padäçrayaù: one must seek shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee who can be one's guru. Caitanya Mahäprabhu advises that a guru is one who strictly follows the instructions of the Bhagavad-gétä: yäre dekha, täre kaha, 'kåñëa'-upadeça (Cc. Madhya 7.128). A juggler, a magician or one who speaks nonsense as an academic career is not a guru. Rather, a guru is one who presents the Bhagavad-gétä, the book of Kåñëa's instructions, as it is. Çravaëa is very important; one must hear from the Vaiñëava sädhu, guru and çästra.
The word kriyäsu, meaning "by manual labor" or "by work," is important in this verse. One should engage in practical service to the Lord. In our Kåñëa consciousness movement, all our activities are concentrated upon distributing Kåñëa literature. This is very important. One may approach any person and induce him to read Kåñëa literature so that in the future he also may become a devotee. Such activities are recommended in this verse. Kriyäsu yas tvac-caraëäravindayoù. Such activities will always remind the devotees of the Lord's lotus feet. By fully concentrating on distributing books for Kåñëa, one is fully absorbed in Kåñëa. This is samädhi.

O Lord, we are fortunate because the heavy burden of the demons upon this earth has been immediately removed by Your appearance. Indeed, we are certainly fortunate, for we shall be able to see upon this earth and in the heavenly planets the marks of lotus, conchshell, club and disc that adorn Your lotus feet.
The soles of the Lord's lotus feet are marked with çaìkha-cakra-gadä-padma—conchshell, disc, club and lotus—and also by a flag and a thunderbolt. When Kåñëa walks on this earth or in the heavenly planets, these marks are visible wherever He goes. Våndävana-dhäma is a transcendental place because of Kåñëa's walking on this land frequently. The inhabitants of Våndävana were fortunate to see these marks here and there. When Akrüra went to Våndävana to take Kåñëa and Balaräma away to the festival arranged by Kaàsa, upon seeing the marks of the Lord's lotus feet on the ground of Våndävana, he fell down and began to groan. These marks are visible to devotees who receive the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tavänukampitäm). The demigods were jubilant not only because the appearance of the Supreme Lord would do away with the burdensome demons, but also because they would be able to see upon the ground the transcendental marks from the soles of the Lord's lotus feet. The gopés always thought of the Lord's lotus feet when He was walking in the pasturing grounds, and, as described in the previous verse, simply by thinking of the Lord's lotus feet, the gopés were fully absorbed in transcendence (äviñöa-cetä na bhaväya kalpate). Like the gopés, one who is always absorbed in thought of the Lord is beyond the material platform and will not remain in this material world. It is our duty, therefore, always to hear, chant and think about the Lord's lotus feet, as is actually done by Vaiñëavas who have decided to live in Våndävana always and think of the Lord's lotus feet twenty-four hours a day.

na—not; te—of Your Lordship; abhavasya—of whom there is no birth, death or maintenance as for an ordinary being; éça—O Supreme Lord; bhavasya—of Your appearance, Your birth; käraëam—the cause; vinä—without; vinodam—the pastimes (despite what is said, You are not forced to come to this world by any cause); bata—however; tarkayämahe—we cannot argue (but must simply understand that these are Your pastimes); bhavaù—birth; nirodhaù—death; sthitiù—maintenance; api—also; avidyayä—by the external, illusory energy; kåtäù—done; yataù—because; tvayi—unto You; abhaya-äçraya—O fearless shelter of all; ätmani—of the ordinary living entity.
O Supreme Lord, You are not an ordinary living entity appearing in this material world as a result of fruitive activities. Therefore Your appearance or birth in this world has no other cause than Your pleasure potency. Similarly, the living entities, who are part of You, have no cause for miseries like birth, death and old age, except when these living entities are conducted by Your external energy.
As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.7), mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù: the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and thus they are qualitatively one with the Lord. We can understand that when the Supreme Lord appears or disappears as an incarnation, there is no other cause than His pleasure potency. We cannot force the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. As He says in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.7):
yadä yadä hi dharmasya
glänir bhavati bhärata
abhyutthänam adharmasya
tadätmänaà såjämy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself." When there is a need to diminish a burden created by the demons, the Supreme Godhead can do it in many ways because He has multifarious energies. There is no need for Him to come as an incarnation, since He is not forced to do anything like ordinary living entities. The living entities come to this material world in the spirit of enjoyment, but because they want to enjoy without Kåñëa (kåñëa-bahirmukha haiyä bhoga-väïchä kare), they suffer birth, death, old age and disease under the control of the illusory energy. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, however, no such causes are involved; His descent is an act of His pleasure potency. We should always remember this distinction between the Lord and the ordinary living entity and not uselessly argue that the Lord cannot come. There are philosophers who do not believe in the Lord's incarnation and who ask, "Why should the Supreme Lord come?" But the answer is, "Why should He not come? Why should He be controlled by the desire of the living entity?" The Lord is free to do whatever He likes. Therefore this verse says, vinä vinodaà bata tarkayämahe. It is only for His pleasure that He comes although He does not need to come.
When the living entities come to this world for material enjoyment, they are entangled in karma and karma-phala by the Lord's illusory energy. But if one seeks shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, one is again situated in his original, liberated state. As stated here, kåtä yatas tvayy abhayäçrayätmani: one who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is always fearless. Because we are dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should give up the idea that without Kåñëa we can enjoy freedom in this material world. This idea is the reason we have become entangled. Now it is our duty to seek shelter again at the Lord's lotus feet. This shelter is described as abhaya, or fearless. Since Kåñëa is not subject to birth, death, old age or disease, and since we are part and parcel of Kåñëa, we also are not subject to birth, death, old age or disease, but we have become subject to these illusory problems because of our forgetfulness of Kåñëa and our position as His eternal servants (jévera 'svarüpa' haya—kåñëera 'nitya-däsa' [Cc. Madhya 20.108]). Therefore, if we practice devotional service by always thinking of the Lord, always glorifying Him and always chanting about Him, as described in text 37 (çåëvan gåëan saàsmarayaàç ca cintayan), we will be reinstated in our original, constitutional position and thus be saved. The demigods, therefore, encouraged Devaké not to fear Kaàsa but to think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was already within her womb.

O supreme controller, Your Lordship previously accepted incarnations as a fish, a horse, a tortoise, Narasiàhadeva, a boar, a swan, Lord Rämacandra, Paraçuräma and, among the demigods, Vämanadeva, to protect the entire world by Your mercy. Now please protect us again by Your mercy by diminishing the disturbances in this world. O Kåñëa, best of the Yadus, we respectfully offer our obeisances unto You.
In every incarnation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has a particular mission to execute, and this was true in His appearance as the son of Devaké in the family of the Yadus. Thus all the demigods offered their prayers to the Lord, bowing down before Him, and requested the Lord to do the needful. We cannot order the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do anything for us. We can simply offer Him our obeisances, as advised in the Bhagavad-gétä (man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru [Bg. 18.65]), and pray to Him for annihilation of dangers.

O Mother Devaké, by your good fortune and ours, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, with all His plenary portions, such as Baladeva, is now within your womb. Therefore you need not fear Kaàsa, who has decided to be killed by the Lord. Your eternal son, Kåñëa, will be the protector of the entire Yadu dynasty.
The word kukñi-gataù, meaning "within the womb of Devaké," has been discussed by Çré Jéva Gosvämé in his Krama-sandarbha commentary. Since it was said at first that Kåñëa was present within the heart of Vasudeva and was transferred to the heart of Devaké, Çré Jéva Gosvämé writes, how is it that Kåñëa was now in the womb? He replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere. As confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.35), aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-sthaà govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi. The Lord can stay wherever He likes. Devaké, therefore, in accordance with the desire of her former life, now had the opportunity to seek the benediction of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as her son, Devaké-nandana.
The words paraù pumän aàçena signify that Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the verdict of the çästra (kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28]). Thus the demigods assured Devaké, "Your son is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is appearing with Baladeva, His plenary portion. He will give you all protection and kill Kaàsa, who has decided to continue his enmity toward the Lord and thus be killed by Him."

Vasudeva said: My Lord, You are the Supreme Person, beyond material existence, and You are the Supersoul. Your form can be perceived by transcendental knowledge, by which You can be understood as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I now understand Your position perfectly.
Within Vasudeva's heart, affection for his son and knowledge of the Supreme Lord's transcendental nature both awakened. In the beginning Vasudeva thought, "Such a beautiful child has been born, but now Kaàsa will come and kill Him." But when he understood that this was not an ordinary child but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became fearless. Regarding his son as the Supreme Lord, wonderful in everything, he began offering prayers appropriate for the Supreme Lord. Completely free from fear of Kaàsa's atrocities, he accepted the child simultaneously as an object of affection and as an object of worship by prayers.

saù—He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva—indeed; sva-prakåtyä—by Your personal energy (mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram); idam—this material world; såñövä—after creating; agre—in the beginning; tri-guëa-ätmakam—made of three modes of energy (sattva-rajas-tamo-guëa); tat anu—thereafter; tvam—Your Lordship; hi—indeed; apraviñöaù—although You did not enter; praviñöaù iva—You appear to have entered; bhävyase—are so understood.
My Lord, You are the same person who in the beginning created this material world by His personal external energy. After the creation of this world of three guëas [sattva, rajas and tamas], You appear to have entered it, although in fact You have not.
In the Bhagavad-gétä (7.4) the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains:
bhümir äpo 'nalo väyuù
khaà mano buddhir eva ca
ahaìkära itéyaà me
bhinnä prakåtir añöadhä
This material world of three modes of nature—sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa—is a composition of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego, all of which are energies coming from Kåñëa, yet Kåñëa, being always transcendental, is aloof from this material world. Those who are not in pure knowledge think that Kåñëa is a product of matter and that His body is material like ours (avajänanti mäà müòhäù [Bg. 9.11]). In fact, however, Kåñëa is always aloof from this material world.
In the Vedic literature, we find the creation described in relationship to Mahä-Viñëu. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.35):
eko 'py asau racayituà jagad-aëòa-koöià
yac-chaktir asti jagad-aëòa-cayä yad-antaù
aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-sthaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead. By His partial plenary expansion as Mahä-Viñëu, He enters into material nature. Then He enters every universe as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, and He enters all the elements, including every atom of matter, as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. Such manifestations of cosmic creation are innumerable, both in the universes and in the individual atoms." Govinda is partially exhibited as antaryämé, the Supersoul, who enters this material world (aëòäntara-stha) and who is also within the atom. The Brahma-saàhitä (5.48) further says:
yasyaika-niçvasita-kälam athävalambya
jévanti loma-vilajä jagad-aëòa-näthäù
viñëur mahän sa iha yasya kalä-viçeño
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
This verse describes Mahä-Viñëu as a plenary expansion of Kåñëa. Mahä-Viñëu lies on the Causal Ocean, and when He exhales, millions of brahmäëòas, or universes, come from the pores of His body. Then, when Mahä-Viñëu inhales, all these brahmäëòas disappear. Thus the millions of brahmäëòas controlled by the Brahmäs and other demigods come and go in this material world through the breathing of Mahä-Viñëu.
Foolish persons think that when Kåñëa appears as the son of Vasudeva, He is limited like an ordinary child. But Vasudeva was aware that although the Lord had appeared as his son, the Lord had not entered Devaké's womb and then come out. Rather, the Lord was always there. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading, present within and without. Praviñöa iva bhävyase: He only seemed to have entered the womb of Devaké and to have now appeared as Vasudeva's child. The expression of this knowledge by Vasudeva indicates that Vasudeva knew how these events had taken place. Vasudeva was certainly a devotee of the Lord in full knowledge, and we must learn from devotees like him. The Bhagavad-gétä (4.34) therefore recommends:
tad viddhi praëipätena
paripraçnena sevayä
upadekñyanti te jïänaà
jïäninas tattva-darçinaù
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth." Vasudeva begot the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet he was in full knowledge of how the Supreme Lord appears and disappears. He was therefore a tattva-darçé, a seer of the truth, because he personally saw how the Supreme Absolute Truth appeared as his son. Vasudeva was not in ignorance, thinking that because the Supreme Godhead had appeared as his son, the Lord had become limited. The Lord is unlimitedly existing and all-pervading, inside and outside. Thus there is no question of His appearance or disappearance.

The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [jéva-bhüta], these separated energies combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the mind or words [aväì-mänasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses. Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never entered the womb of Devaké; rather, You existed there already.
This same understanding is explained by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.4):
mayä tatam idaà sarvaà
jagad-avyakta-mürtinä
mat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni
na cähaà teñv avasthitaù
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them."
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord Çré Kåñëa's name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.38):
premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti
One can always see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, within oneself and outside oneself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude toward Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. In the above-mentioned verse from the Bhagavad-gétä, therefore, it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As discussed in the Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.
Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such arguments, the Lord says, "I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof." For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king's energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king's power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.
One may argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who creates the whole cosmic manifestation simply by His glance, cannot come within the womb of Devaké, the wife of Vasudeva. To eradicate this argument, Vasudeva said, "My dear Lord, it is not very wonderful that You appeared within the womb of Devaké, for the creation was also made in that way. You were lying in the Causal Ocean as Mahä-Viñëu, and by Your breathing, innumerable universes came into existence. Then You entered into each of the universes as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Then again You expanded Yourself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu and entered into the heart of all living entities and entered even within the atoms. Therefore Your entrance into the womb of Devaké is understandable in the same way. You appear to have entered, but You are simultaneously all-pervading. We can understand Your entrance and nonentrance from material examples. The total material energy remains intact even after being divided into sixteen elements. The material body is nothing but a combination of the five gross elements—namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Whenever there is a material body, it appears that such elements are newly created, but actually the elements are always existing outside of the body. Similarly, although You appear as a child in the womb of Devaké, You are also existing outside. You are always in Your abode, but still You can simultaneously expand Yourself into millions of forms.
"One has to understand Your appearance with great intelligence because the material energy is also emanating from You. You are the original source of the material energy, just as the sun is the source of the sunshine. The sunshine cannot cover the sun globe, nor can the material energy—being an emanation from You—cover You. You appear to be in the three modes of material energy, but actually the three modes of material energy cannot cover You. This is understood by the highly intellectual philosophers. In other words, although You appear to be within the material energy, You are never covered by it."
We hear from the Vedic version that the Supreme Brahman exhibits His effulgence and therefore everything is illuminated. We can understand from the Brahma-saàhitä that the brahma-jyoti, or the Brahman effulgence, emanates from the body of the Supreme Lord. And from the Brahman effulgence, all creation takes place. It is further stated in the Bhagavad-gétä that the Lord is the support of the Brahman effulgence. Originally He is the root cause of everything. But persons who are less intelligent think that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes within this material world, He accepts material qualities. Such conclusions are not mature but are made by the less intelligent.

yaù—anyone who; ätmanaù—of his own real identity, the soul; dåçya-guëeñu—among the visible objects, beginning with the body; san—being situated in that position; iti—thus; vyavasyate—continues to act; sva-vyatirekataù—as if the body were independent of the soul; abudhaù—a rascal; vinä anuvädam—without proper analytical study; na—not; ca—also; tat—the body and other visible objects; manéñitam—such considerations having been discussed; samyak—fully; yataù—because he is a fool; tyaktam—are rejected; upädadat—accepts this body as reality; pumän—a person.
One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in the soul, the visible body and senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it a reality.
Without the basic principle of the soul, the body cannot be produced. So-called scientists have tried in many ways to produce a living body in their chemical laboratories, but no one has been able to do it because unless the spirit soul is present, a body cannot be prepared from material elements. Since scientists are now enamored of theories about the chemical composition of the body, we have challenged many scientists to make even a small egg. The chemicals in eggs can be found very easily. There is a white substance and a yellow substance, covered by a shell, and modern scientists should very easily be able to duplicate all this. But even if they were to prepare such an egg and put it in an incubator, this man-made chemical egg would not produce a chicken. The soul must be added because there is no question of a chemical combination for life. Those who think that life can exist without the soul have therefore been described here as abudhaù, foolish rascals.
Again, there are those who reject the body, regarding it as insubstantial. They are of the same category of fools. One can neither reject the body nor accept it as substantial. The substance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and both the body and the soul are energies of the Supreme Godhead, as described by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.4-5):
bhümir äpo 'nalo väyuù
khaà mano buddhir eva ca
ahaìkära itéyaà me
bhinnä prakåtir añöadhä
apareyam itas tv anyäà
prakåtià viddhi me paräm
jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho
yayedaà dhäryate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these eight constitute My separated material energies. Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature."
The body, therefore, has a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the soul does. Since both of them are energies of the Lord, neither of them is false, because they come from the reality. One who does not know this secret of life is described as abudhaù. According to the Vedic injunctions, aitadätmyam idaà sarvam, sarvaà khalv idaà brahma: everything is the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, both the body and the soul are Brahman, since matter and spirit emanate from Brahman.
Not knowing the conclusions of the Vedas, some people accept the material nature as substance, and others accept the spirit soul as substance, but actually Brahman is the substance. Brahman is the cause of all causes. The ingredients and the immediate cause of this manifested material world are Brahman, and we cannot make the ingredients of this world independent of Brahman. Furthermore, since the ingredients and the immediate cause of this material manifestation are Brahman, both of them are truth, satya; there is no validity to the expression brahma satyaà jagan mithyä. The world is not false.
Jïänés reject this world, and foolish persons accept this world as reality, and in this way they are both misguided. Although the body is not as important as the soul, we cannot say that it is false. Yet the body is temporary, and only foolish, materialistic persons, who do not have full knowledge of the soul, regard the temporary body as reality and engage in decorating this body. Both of these pitfalls—rejection of the body as false and acceptance of the body as all in all—can be avoided when one is fully situated in Kåñëa consciousness. If we regard this world as false, we fall into the category of asuras, who say that this world is unreal, with no foundation and no God in control (asatyam apratiñöhaà te jagad ähur anéçvaram). As described in the Sixteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, this is the conclusion of demons.

O my Lord, learned Vedic scholars conclude that the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the entire cosmic manifestation are performed by You, who are free from endeavor, unaffected by the modes of material nature, and changeless in Your spiritual situation. There are no contradictions in You, who are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Para-brahman. Because the three modes of material nature-sattva, rajas and tamas—are under Your control, everything takes place automatically.
As stated in the Vedas:
na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate
na tat-samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate
paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate
sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca
 [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]
"The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to or greater than Him, for everything is done naturally and systematically by His multifarious energies." (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.8) Creation, maintenance and annihilation are all conducted personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram [Bg. 9.10]). Yet ultimately the Lord does not need to do anything, and therefore He is nirvikära, changeless. Because everything is done under His direction, He is called såñöi-kartä, the master of creation. Similarly, He is the master of annihilation. When a master sits in one place while his servants work in different duties, whatever the servants are doing is ultimately an activity of the master, although he is doing nothing (na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate). The Lord's potencies are so numerous that everything is nicely done. Therefore, He is naturally still and is not directly the doer of anything in this material world.

saù tvam—Your Lordship, who are the same person, the Transcendence; tri-loka-sthitaye—to maintain the three worlds, the upper, middle and lower planetary systems; sva-mäyayä—by Your personal energy (ätma-mäyayä); bibharñi—assume; çuklam—the white form of Viñëu in goodness; khalu—as well as; varëam—color; ätmanaù—of the same category as You (viñëu-tattva); sargäya—for the creation of the entire world; raktam—the reddish color of rajo-guëa; rajasä—with the quality of passion; upabåàhitam—being charged; kåñëam ca—and the quality of darkness; varëam—the color; tamasä—which is surrounded by ignorance; jana-atyaye—for the ultimate destruction of the entire creation.
My Lord, Your form is transcendental to the three material modes, yet for the maintenance of the three worlds, You assume the white color of Viñëu in goodness; for creation, which is surrounded by the quality of passion, You appear reddish; and at the end, when there is a need for annihilation, which is surrounded by ignorance, You appear blackish.
Vasudeva prayed to the Lord, "You are called çuklam. Çuklam, or 'whiteness,' is the symbolic representation of the Absolute Truth because it is unaffected by the material qualities. Lord Brahmä is called rakta, or red, because Brahmä represents the quality of passion for creation. Darkness is entrusted to Lord Çiva because he annihilates the cosmos. The creation, annihilation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation are conducted by Your potencies, yet You are always unaffected by those qualities." As confirmed in the Vedas, harir hi nirguëaù säkñät: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always free from all material qualities. It is also said that the qualities of passion and ignorance are nonexistent in the person of the Supreme Lord.
In this verse, the three colors mentioned—çukla, rakta and kåñëa—are not to be understood literally, in terms of what we experience with our senses, but rather as representatives of sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa. After all, sometimes we see that a heron is white, although it is in tamo-guëa, the mode of ignorance. Illustrating the logic called bakändha-nyäya, the heron is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the heron is always in darkness. Vyäsadeva, however, the compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in tamo-guëa; rather, he is in the highest position of sattva-guëa, beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (çukla-raktas tathä pétaù) are used to designate the brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras. Lord Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu is celebrated as possessing a blackish color, Lord Çiva is whitish, and Lord Brahmä is reddish, but according to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé in the Vaiñëava-toñaëé-öékä, this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here.
The real understanding of çukla, rakta and kåñëa is as follows. The Lord is always transcendental, but for the sake of creation He assumes the color rakta as Lord Brahmä. Again, sometimes the Lord becomes angry. As He says in the Bhagavad-gétä (16.19):
tän ahaà dviñataù krürän
saàsäreñu narädhamän
kñipämy ajasram açubhän
äsuréñv eva yoniñu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." To destroy the demons, the Lord becomes angry, and therefore He assumes the form of Lord Çiva. In summary, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always beyond the material qualities, and we should not be misled into thinking otherwise simply because of sense perception. One must understand the position of the Lord through the authorities, or mahäjanas. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.3.28), ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam.

O my Lord, proprietor of all creation, You have now appeared in my house, desiring to protect this world. I am sure that You will kill all the armies that are moving all over the world under the leadership of politicians who are dressed as kñatriya rulers but who are factually demons. They must be killed by You for the protection of the innocent public.
Kåñëa appears in this world for two purposes, pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm: [Bg. 4.8] to protect the innocent, religious devotees of the Lord and to annihilate all the uneducated, uncultured asuras, who unnecessarily bark like dogs and fight among themselves for political power. It is said, kali-käle näma-rüpe kåñëa avatära. The Hare Kåñëa movement is also an incarnation of Kåñëa in the form of the holy name (näma-rüpe). Every one of us who is actually afraid of the asuric rulers and politicians must welcome this incarnation of Kåñëa: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Then we will surely be protected from the harassment of asuric rulers. At the present moment these rulers are so powerful that by hook or by crook they capture the highest posts in government and harass countless numbers of people on the plea of national security or some emergency. Then again, one asura defeats another asura, but the public continues to suffer. Therefore the entire world is in a precarious condition, and the only hope is this Hare Kåñëa movement. Lord Nåsiàhadeva appeared when Prahläda was excessively harassed by his asuric father. Because of such asuric fathers—that is, the ruling politicians—it is very difficult to press forward the Hare Kåñëa movement, but because Kåñëa has now appeared in His holy name through this movement, we can hope that these asuric fathers will be annihilated and the kingdom of God established all over the world. The entire world is now full of many asuras in the guise of politicians, gurus, sädhus, yogés and incarnations, and they are misleading the general public away from Kåñëa consciousness, which can offer true benefit to human society.

ayam—this (rascal); tu—but; asabhyaù—who is not civilized at all (asura means "uncivilized," and sura means "civilized"); tava—of Your Lordship; janma—the birth; nau—our; gåhe—into the home; çrutvä—after hearing; agrajän te—all the brothers born before You; nyavadhét—killed; sura-éçvara—O Lord of the suras, the civilized persons; saù—he (that uncivilized Kaàsa); te—Your; avatäram—appearance; puruñaiù—by his lieutenants; samarpitam—being informed of; çrutvä—after hearing; adhunä—now; eva—indeed; abhisarati—will come immediately; udäyudhaù—with raised weapons.
O my Lord, Lord of the demigods, after hearing the prophecy that You would take birth in our home and kill him, this uncivilized Kaàsa killed so many of Your elder brothers. As soon as he hears from his lieutenants that You have appeared, he will immediately come with weapons to kill You.
Kaàsa has here been described as asabhya, meaning "uncivilized" or "most heinous," because he killed the many children of his sister. When he heard the prophecy that he would be killed by her eighth son, this uncivilized man, Kaàsa, was immediately ready to kill his innocent sister on the occasion of her marriage. An uncivilized man can do anything for the satisfaction of his senses. He can kill children, he can kill cows, he can kill brähmaëas, he can kill old men; he has no mercy for anyone. According to the Vedic civilization, cows, women, children, old men and brähmaëas should be excused if they are at fault. But asuras, uncivilized men, do not care about that. At the present moment, the killing of cows and the killing of children is going on unrestrictedly, and therefore this civilization is not at all human, and those who are conducting this condemned civilization are uncivilized asuras.
Such uncivilized men are not in favor of the Kåñëa consciousness movement. As public officers, they declare without hesitation that the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa movement is a nuisance, although the Bhagavad-gétä clearly says, satataà kértayanto mäà yatantaç ca dåòha-vratäù [Bg. 9.14]. According to this verse, it is the duty of the mahätmäs to chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra and try to spread it all over the world to the best of their ability. Unfortunately, society is in such an uncivilized state that there are so-called mahätmäs who are prepared to kill cows and children and stop the Hare Kåñëa movement. Such uncivilized activities were actually demonstrated in opposition to the Hare Kåñëa movement's Bombay center, Hare Krishna Land. As Kaàsa was not expected to kill the beautiful child of Devaké and Vasudeva, the uncivilized society, although unhappy about the advancement of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, cannot be expected to stop it. Yet we must face many difficulties in many different ways. Although Kåñëa cannot be killed, Vasudeva, as the father of Kåñëa, was trembling because in affection he thought that Kaàsa would immediately come and kill his son. Similarly, although the Kåñëa consciousness movement and Kåñëa are not different and no asuras can check it, we are afraid that at any moment the asuras can stop this movement in any part of the world.

çré-devaké uväca—Çré Devaké said; rüpam—form or substance; yat tat—because You are the same substance; prähuù—You are sometimes called; avyaktam—not perceivable by the material senses (ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù); ädyam—You are the original cause; brahma—You are known as Brahman; jyotiù—light; nirguëam—without material qualities; nirvikäram—without change, the same form of Viñëu perpetually; sattä-mätram—the original substance, the cause of everything; nirviçeñam—You are present everywhere as the Supersoul (within the heart of a human being and within the heart of an animal, the same substance is present); niréham—without material desires; saù—that Supreme Person; tvam—Your Lordship; säkñät—directly; viñëuù—Lord Viñëu; adhyätma-dépaù—the light for all transcendental knowledge (knowing You, one knows everything: kasmin nu bhagavo vijïäte sarvam idaà vijïätaà bhavatéti).
Çré Devaké said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Paramätmä, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Viñëu, the light of all transcendental knowledge.
Viñëu is the origin of everything, and there is no difference between Lord Viñëu and Lord Kåñëa because both of Them are viñëu-tattva. From the Åg Veda we understand, oà tad viñëoù paramaà padam: the original substance is the all-pervading Lord Viñëu, who is also Paramätmä and the effulgent Brahman. The living entities are also part and parcel of Viñëu, who has various energies (paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]). Viñëu, or Kåñëa, is therefore everything. Lord Kåñëa says in the Bhagavad-gétä (10.8), ahaà sarvasya prabhavo mattaù sarvaà pravartate: "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me." Kåñëa, therefore, is the original cause of everything (sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]). When Viñëu expands in His all-pervading aspect, we should understand Him to be the niräkära-nirviçeña-brahma-jyoti.
Although everything emanates from Kåñëa, He is ultimately a person. Aham ädir hi devänäm: [Bg 10.2] He is the origin of Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara, and from them many other demigods are manifested. Kåñëa therefore says in the Bhagavad-gétä (14.27), brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham: "Brahman rests upon Me." The Lord also says:
ye 'py anya-devatä-bhaktä
yajante çraddhayänvitäù
te 'pi mäm eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-pürvakam
"Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunté, but they do so in a wrong way." (Bg. 9.23) There are many persons who worship different demigods, considering all of them to be separate Gods, which in fact they are not. The fact is that every demigod, and every living entity, is part and parcel of Kåñëa (mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù [Bg. 15.7]). The demigods are also in the category of living entities; they are not separate gods. But men whose knowledge is immature and contaminated by the modes of material nature worship various demigods, according to their intelligence. Therefore they are rebuked in the Bhagavad-gétä (kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù [Bg. 7.20]). Because they are unintelligent and not very advanced and have not properly considered the truth, they take to the worship of various demigods or speculate according to various philosophies, such as the Mäyäväda philosophy.
Kåñëa, Viñëu, is the actual origin of everything. As stated in the Vedas, yasya bhäñä sarvam idaà vibhäti. The Absolute Truth is described later in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.28.15) as satyaà jïänam anantam yad brahma-jyotiù sanätanam. The brahma-jyoti is sanätana, eternal, yet it is dependent on Kåñëa (brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham). The Brahma-saàhitä states that the Lord is all-pervading. Aëòäntara-stha-paramäëu-cayäntara-stham: [Bs. 5.35] He is within this universe, and He is within the atom as Paramätmä. Yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi-koöiñv açeña-vasudhädi-vibhuti-bhinnam: [Bs. 5.40] Brahman is also not independent of Him. Therefore whatever a philosopher may describe is ultimately Kåñëa, or Lord Viñëu (sarvaà khalv idaà brahma, paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän [Bg. 10.12]). According to different phases of understanding, Lord Viñëu is differently described, but in fact He is the origin of everything.
Because Devaké was an unalloyed devotee, she could understand that the same Lord Viñëu had appeared as her son. Therefore, after the prayers of Vasudeva, Devaké offered her prayers. She was very frightened because of her brother's atrocities. Devaké said, "My dear Lord, Your eternal forms, like Näräyaëa, Lord Räma, Çeña, Varäha, Nåsiàha, Vämana, Baladeva, and millions of similar incarnations emanating from Viñëu, are described in the Vedic literature as original. You are original because all Your forms as incarnations are outside of this material creation. Your form was existing before this cosmic manifestation was created. Your forms are eternal and all-pervading. They are self-effulgent, changeless and uncontaminated by the material qualities. Such eternal forms are ever-cognizant and full of bliss; they are situated in transcendental goodness and are always engaged in different pastimes. You are not limited to a particular form only; all such transcendental, eternal forms are self-sufficient. I can understand that You are the Supreme Lord Viñëu." We may conclude, therefore, that Lord Viñëu is everything, although He is also different from everything. This is the acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva philosophy.

nañöe—after the annihilation; loke—of the cosmic manifestation; dvi-parärdha-avasäne—after millions and millions of years (the life of Brahmä); mahä-bhüteñu—when the five primary elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether); ädi-bhütam gateñu—enter within the subtle elements of sense perception; vyakte—when everything manifested; avyaktam—into the unmanifested; käla-vegena—by the force of time; yäte—enters; bhavän—Your Lordship; ekaù—alone; çiñyate—remains; çeña-saàjïaù—named Çeña.
After millions of years, at the time of cosmic annihilation, when everything, manifested and unmanifested, is annihilated by the force of time, the five gross elements enter into the subtle conception, and the manifested categories enter into the unmanifested substance. At that time, You alone remain, and You are known as Ananta Çeña-näga.
At the time of annihilation, the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—enter into the mind, intelligence and false ego (ahaìkära), and the entire cosmic manifestation enters into the spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who alone remains as the origin of everything. The Lord is therefore known as Çeña-näga, as Ädi-puruña and by many other names.
Devaké therefore prayed, "After many millions of years, when Lord Brahmä comes to the end of his life, the annihilation of the cosmic manifestation takes place. At that time the five gross elements—namely earth, water, fire, air and ether—enter into the mahat-tattva. The mahat-tattva enters, by the force of time, into the nonmanifested total material energy, the total material energy enters into the energetic pradhäna, and the pradhäna enters into You. Therefore after the annihilation of the whole cosmic manifestation, You alone remain with Your transcendental name, form, qualities and paraphernalia.
"My Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because You are the director of the unmanifested total energy, and the ultimate reservoir of the material nature. My Lord, the whole cosmic manifestation is under the influence of time, beginning from the moment up to the duration of the year. All act under Your direction. Therefore You are the original director of everything and the reservoir of all potent energies."

O inaugurator of the material energy, this wonderful creation works under the control of powerful time, which is divided into seconds, minutes, hours and years. This element of time, which extends for many millions of years, is but another form of Lord Viñëu. For Your pastimes, You act as the controller of time, but You are the reservoir of all good fortune. Let me offer my full surrender unto Your Lordship.
As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.52):
yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà
räjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù
yasyäjïayä bhramati saàbhåta-käla-cakro
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"The sun is the king of all planetary systems and has unlimited potency in the form of heat and light. I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time." Although we see the cosmic manifestation as gigantic and wonderful, it is within the limitations of käla, the time factor. This time factor is also controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram [Bg. 9.10]). Prakåti, the cosmic manifestation, is under the control of time. Indeed, everything is under the control of time, and time is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord has no fear of the onslaughts of time. Time is estimated according to the movements of the sun (savitä). Every minute, every second, every day, every night, every month and every year of time can be calculated according to the sun's movements. But the sun is not independent, for it is under time's control. Bhramati saàbhåta-käla-cakraù: the sun moves within the käla-cakra, the orbit of time. The sun is under the control of time, and time is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord has no fear of time.
The Lord is addressed here as avyakta-bandhu, or the inaugurator of the movements of the entire cosmic manifestation. Sometimes the cosmic manifestation is compared to a potter's wheel. When a potter's wheel is spinning, who has set it in motion? It is the potter, of course, although sometimes we can see only the motion of the wheel and cannot see the potter himself. Therefore the Lord, who is behind the motion of the cosmos, is called avyakta-bandhu. Everything is within the limits of time, but time moves under the direction of the Lord, who is therefore not within time's limit.

martyaù—the living entities who are sure to die; måtyu-vyäla-bhétaù—afraid of the serpent of death; paläyan—running (as soon as a serpent is seen, everyone runs away, fearing immediate death); lokän—to the different planets; sarvän—all; nirbhayam—fearlessness; na adhyagacchat—do not obtain; tvat-päda-abjam—of Your lotus feet; präpya—obtaining the shelter; yadåcchayä—by chance, by the mercy of Your Lordship and Your representative, the spiritual master (guru-kåpä, kåñëa-kåpä); adya—presently; su-sthaù—being undisturbed and mentally composed; çete—are sleeping; måtyuù—death; asmät—from those persons; apaiti—flees.
No one in this material world has become free from the four principles of birth, death, old age and disease, even by fleeing to various planets. But now that You have appeared, My Lord, death is fleeing in fear of You, and the living entities, having obtained shelter at Your lotus feet by Your mercy, are sleeping in full mental peace.
There are different categories of living entities, but everyone is afraid of death. The highest aim of the karmés is to be promoted to the higher, heavenly planets, where the duration of life is very long. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (8.17), sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaëo viduù: one day (twelve hours) of Brahmä equals 1,000 yugas, and each yuga consists of 4,320,000 years. Similarly, Brahmä has a night of 1,000 times 4,320,000 years. In this way, we may calculate Brahmä's month and year, but even Brahmä, who lives for millions and millions of years (dvi-parärdha-käla), also must die. According to Vedic çästra, the inhabitants of the higher planetary systems live for 10,000 years, and just as Brahmä's day is calculated to equal 4,300,000,000 of our years, one day in the higher planetary systems equals six of our months. Karmés, therefore, try for promotion to the higher planetary systems, but this cannot free them from death. In this material world, everyone from Brahmä to the insignificant ant must die. Therefore this world is called martya-loka. As Kåñëa says in the Bhagavad-gétä (8.16), äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino'rjuna: as long as one is within this material world, either on Brahmaloka or on any other loka within this universe, one must undergo the käla-cakra of one life after another (bhütvä bhütvä praléyate) [Bg. 8.19]. But if one returns to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yad gatvä na nivartante [Bg. 15.6]), one need not reenter the limits of time. Therefore, devotees who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord can sleep very peacefully with this assurance from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.9), tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti: after giving up the present body, a devotee who has understood Kåñëa as He is need not return to this material world.
The constitutional position of the living entity is eternity (na hanyate hanyamäne çarére, nityaù çäçvato 'yam [Bg. 2.20]). Every living entity is eternal. But because of having fallen into this material world, one wanders within the universe, continually changing from one body to another. Caitanya Mahäprabhu says:
brahmäëòa bhramite kona bhägyavän jéva
guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
Everyone is wandering up and down within this universe, but one who is sufficiently fortunate comes in contact with Kåñëa consciousness by the mercy of the spiritual master and takes to the path of devotional service. Then one is assured of eternal life, with no fear of death. When Kåñëa appears, everyone is freed from fear of death, yet Devaké felt, "We are still afraid of Kaàsa, although You have appeared as our son." She was more or less bewildered as to why this should be so, and she appealed to the Lord to free her and Vasudeva from this fear.
In this connection, it may be noted that the moon is one of the heavenly planets. From the Vedic literature we understand that one who goes to the moon receives a life with a duration of ten thousand years in which to enjoy the fruits of pious activities. If our so-called scientists are going to the moon, why should they come back here? We must conclude without a doubt that they have never gone to the moon. To go to the moon, one must have the qualification of pious activities. Then one may go there and live. If one has gone to the moon, why should he return to this planet, where life is of a very short duration?

My Lord, because You dispel all the fear of Your devotees, I request You to save us and give us protection from the terrible fear of Kaàsa. Your form as Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is appreciated by yogés in meditation. Please make this form invisible to those who see with material eyes.
The word dhyäna-dhiñëyam is significant in this verse because the form of Lord Viñëu is meditated upon by yogés (dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù [SB 12.13.1]). Devaké requested the Lord, who had appeared as Viñëu, to conceal that form, for she wanted to see the Lord as an ordinary child, like a child appreciated by persons who have material eyes. Devaké wanted to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead had factually appeared or she was dreaming the Viñëu form. If Kaàsa were to come, she thought, upon seeing the Viñëu form he would immediately kill the child, but if he saw a human child he might reconsider. Devaké was afraid of Ugrasena-ätmaja; that is, she was afraid not of Ugrasena and his men, but of the son of Ugrasena. Thus she requested the Lord to dissipate that fear, since He is always ready to give protection (abhayam) to His devotees. "My Lord," she prayed, "I request You to save me from the cruel hands of the son of Ugrasena, Kaàsa. I am praying to Your Lordship to please rescue me from this fearful condition because You are always ready to give protection to Your servitors." The Lord has confirmed this statement in the Bhagavad-gétä by assuring Arjuna, "You may declare to the world, My devotee shall never be vanquished."
While thus praying to the Lord for rescue, Mother Devaké expressed her motherly affection: "I understand that this transcendental form is generally perceived in meditation by the great sages, but I am still afraid because as soon as Kaàsa understands that You have appeared, he might harm You. So I request that for the time being You become invisible to our material eyes." In other words, she requested the Lord to assume the form of an ordinary child. "My only cause of fear from my brother Kaàsa is due to Your appearance. My Lord Madhusüdana, Kaàsa may know that You are already born. Therefore I request You to conceal this four-armed form of Your Lordship, which holds the four symbols of Viñëu—namely the conchshell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. My dear Lord, at the end of the annihilation of the cosmic manifestation, You put the whole universe within Your abdomen; still, by Your unalloyed mercy, You have appeared in my womb. I am surprised that You imitate the activities of ordinary human beings just to please Your devotee."
Devaké was so afraid of Kaàsa that she could not believe that Kaàsa would be unable to kill Lord Viñëu, who was personally present. Out of motherly affection, therefore, she requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to disappear. Although because of the Lord's disappearance Kaàsa would harass her more and more, thinking that the child born of her was hidden somewhere, she did not want the transcendental child to be harassed and killed. Therefore she requested Lord Viñëu to disappear. Later, when harassed, she would think of Him within her mind.

O Madhusüdana, because of Your appearance, I am becoming more and more anxious in fear of Kaàsa. Therefore, please arrange for that sinful Kaàsa to be unable to understand that You have taken birth from my womb.
Devaké addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Madhusüdana. She was aware that the Lord had killed many demons like Madhu who were hundreds and thousands of times more powerful than Kaàsa, yet because of affection for the transcendental child, she believed that Kaàsa could kill Him. Instead of thinking of the unlimited power of the Lord, she thought of the Lord with affection, and therefore she requested the transcendental child to disappear.

O my Lord, You are the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Your transcendental four-armed form, holding conchshell, disc, club and lotus, is unnatural for this world. Please withdraw this form [and become just like a natural human child so that I may try to hide You somewhere].
Devaké was thinking of hiding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not handing Him over to Kaàsa, as she had done with all her previous children. Although Vasudeva had promised to hand over every child to Kaàsa, this time he wanted to break his promise and hide the child somewhere. But because of the Lord's appearance in this surprising four-armed form, He would be impossible to hide.

viçvam—the entire cosmic manifestation; yat etat—containing all moving and nonmoving creations; sva-tanau—within Your body; niçä-ante—at the time of devastation; yathä-avakäçam—shelter in Your body without difficulty; puruñaù—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; paraù—transcendental; bhavän—Your Lordship; bibharti—keep; saù—that (Supreme Personality of Godhead); ayam—this form; mama—my; garbha-gaù—came within my womb; abhüt—it so happened; aho—alas; nå-lokasya—within this material world of living entities; viòambanam—it is impossible to think of; hi—indeed; tat—that (kind of conception).
At the time of devastation, the entire cosmos, containing all created moving and nonmoving entities, enters Your transcendental body and is held there without difficulty. But now this transcendental form has taken birth from my womb. People will not be able to believe this, and I shall become an object of ridicule.
As explained in the Caitanya-caritämåta, loving service to the Personality of Godhead is of two different kinds: aiçvarya-pürëa, full of opulence, and aiçvarya-çithila, without opulence. Real love of Godhead begins with aiçvarya-çithila, simply on the basis of pure love.
premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti
yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
(Brahma-saàhitä 5.38)
Pure devotees, whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of prema, love, want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Çyämasundara, Muralédhara, with a flute swaying in His two hands. This is the form available to the inhabitants of Våndävana, who are all in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Çyämasundara, not as Lord Viñëu, Näräyaëa, who is worshiped in Vaikuëöha, where the devotees admire His opulence. Although Devaké is not on the Våndävana platform, she is near the Våndävana platform. On the Våndävana platform the mother of Kåñëa is Mother Yaçodä, and on the Mathurä and Dvärakä platform the mother of Kåñëa is Devaké. In Mathurä and Dvärakä the love for the Lord is mixed with appreciation of His opulence, but in Våndävana the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not exhibited.
There are five stages of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead—çänta, däsya, sakhya, vätsalya and mädhurya. Devaké is on the platform of vätsalya. She wanted to deal with her eternal son, Kåñëa, in that stage of love, and therefore she wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead to withdraw His opulent form of Viñëu. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura illuminates this fact very clearly in his explanation of this verse.
Bhakti, bhagavän and bhakta do not belong to the material world. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (14.26):
mäà ca yo 'vyabhicäreëa
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa guëän samatétyaitän
brahma-bhüyäya kalpate
"One who engages in the spiritual activities of unalloyed devotional service immediately transcends the modes of material nature and is elevated to the spiritual platform." From the very beginning of one's transactions in bhakti, one is situated on the transcendental platform. Vasudeva and Devaké, therefore, being situated in a completely pure devotional state, are beyond this material world and are not subject to material fear. In the transcendental world, however, because of pure devotion, there is a similar conception of fear, which is due to intense love.
As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù [Bg. 18.55]) and as confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù), without bhakti one cannot understand the spiritual situation of the Lord. Bhakti may be considered in three stages, called guëé-bhüta, pradhäné-bhüta and kevala, and according to these stages there are three divisions, which are called jïäna, jïänamayé and rati, or premä—that is, simple knowledge, love mixed with knowledge, and pure love. By simple knowledge one can perceive transcendental bliss without variety. This perception is called mäna-bhüti. When one comes to the stage of jïänamayé, one realizes the transcendental opulences of the Personality of Godhead. But when one reaches pure love, one realizes the transcendental form of the Lord as Lord Kåñëa or Lord Räma. This is what is wanted. Especially in the mädhurya-rasa, one becomes attached to the Personality of Godhead (çré-vigraha-niñöha-rüpädi). Then loving transactions between the Lord and the devotee begin.
The special significance of Kåñëa's bearing a flute in His hands in Vrajabhümi, Våndävana, is described as mädhur . . . viräjate. The form of the Lord with a flute in His hands is most attractive, and the one who is most sublimely attracted is Çrématé Rädhäräëé, Rädhikä. She enjoys supremely blissful association with Kåñëa. Sometimes people cannot understand why Rädhikä's name is not mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Actually, however, the name Rädhikä can be understood from the word aradhitaù in the verse beginning with the words anayärädhito nünam (SB 10.30.28), which indicate that Çrématé Rädhäräëé enjoys the highest loving affairs with Kåñëa.
Not wanting to be ridiculed for having given birth to Viñëu, Devaké wanted Kåñëa, with two hands, and therefore she requested the Lord to change His form.

The two demigods Nalaküvara and Maëigréva, because of their continuing memory, could understand the supremacy of Kåñëa by the grace of Närada. Now they admitted, "That we should be delivered by the blessings of Närada Muni was all Your plan. Therefore You are the supreme mystic. Everything—past, present and future—is known to You. Your plan was made so nicely that although we stayed here as twin arjuna trees, You have appeared as a small boy to deliver us. This was all Your inconceivable arrangement. Because You are the Supreme Person, You can do everything."

 [Cc. Madhya 17.136]
Kåñëa's name, attributes and form are Absolute Truth, existing before the creation. Therefore, how can those who are created-that is, those entrapped in bodies created of material elements—understand Kåñëa perfectly? This is not possible. But, sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù: Kåñëa reveals Himself to those engaged in devotional service. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.55) by the Lord Himself: bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti. Even the descriptions of Kåñëa in Çrémad-Bhägavatam are sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore, the best course by which to know Him is to engage oneself in pure devotional activities. The more one advances in devotional activities, the more one can understand Him as He is. If from the material platform one could understand Kåñëa, then, since Kåñëa is everything (sarvaà khalv idaà brahma), one could understand Kåñëa by seeing anything within this material world. But that is not possible.

Because You are everything and are therefore the Supreme Brahman, we simply offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
Instead of trying to understand Kåñëa in detail, it is better to offer our respectful obeisances unto Him, for He is the origin of everything and He is everything. Because we are covered by the material modes of nature, He is very difficult for us to understand unless He reveals Himself to us. Therefore it is better for us to acknowledge that He is everything and offer obeisances unto His lotus feet.

Appearing in bodies like those of an ordinary fish, tortoise and hog, You exhibit activities impossible for such creatures to perform—extraordinary, incomparable, transcendental activities of unlimited power and strength. These bodies of Yours, therefore, are not made of material elements, but are incarnations of Your Supreme Personality. You are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have now appeared, with full potency, for the benefit of all living entities within this material world.
As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.7-8):
yadä yadä hi dharmasya
glänir bhavati bhärata
abhyutthänam adharmasya
tadätmänaà såjämy aham
pariträëäya sädhünäà

Kåñëa appears as an incarnation when real spiritual life declines and when rogues and thieves increase to disturb the situation of the world. Unfortunate, less intelligent persons, bereft of devotional service, cannot understand the Lord's activities, and therefore such persons describe these activities as kalpanä-mythology or imagination-because they are rascals and the lowest of men (na mäà duñkåtino müòhäù prapadyante narädhamäù [Bg. 7.15]). Such men cannot understand that the events described by Vyäsadeva in the puräëas and other çästras are not fictitious or imaginary, but factual.
Kåñëa, in His full, unlimited potency, here shows that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for although the two trees were so large and sturdy that even many elephants could not move them, Kåñëa, as a child, exhibited such extraordinary strength that they fell down with a great sound. From the very beginning, by killing Pütanä, Çakaöäsura and Tåëävartäsura, by causing the trees to fall, and by showing the entire universe within His mouth, Kåñëa proved that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The lowest of men (müòhas), because of sinful activities, cannot understand this, but devotees can accept it without a doubt. Thus the position of a devotee is different from that of a nondevotee.

O supremely auspicious, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You, who are the supreme good. O most famous descendant and controller of the Yadu dynasty, O son of Vasudeva, O most peaceful, let us offer our obeisances unto Your lotus feet.
The word parama-kalyäëa is significant because Kåñëa, in any of His incarnations, appears in order to protect the sädhus (pariträëäya sädhünäm [Bg. 4.8]). The sädhus, saintly persons or devotees, are always harassed by nondevotees, and Kåñëa appears in His incarnations to give them relief. This is His first concern. If we study the history of Kåñëa's life, we shall find that for most of His life He predominantly engaged in killing demons one after another.

Unless delivered or blessed by a devotee, one cannot realize that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Manuñyäëäà sahasreñu kaçcid yatati siddhaye. According to this verse of Bhagavad-gétä (7.3), there are so many siddhas or yogés who cannot understand Kåñëa; instead, they misunderstand Him. But if one takes shelter of a devotee descending from the paramparä system of Närada (svayambhür näradaù çambhuù [SB 6.3.20]), one can then understand who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, many pseudo incarnations are advertised simply for having exhibited some magical performances, but except for persons who are servants of Närada and other servants of Kåñëa, no one can understand who is God and who is not. This is confirmed by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. Chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: no one is delivered from the material conception of life unless favored by a Vaiñëava. Others can never understand, neither by speculation nor by any other bodily or mental gymnastics.

Everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. Håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc. Madhya 19.170] (Närada Païcarätra). Everything—the mind, the body and all the sense organs—should be engaged in Kåñëa's service. This is to be learned from expert devotees like Närada, Svayambhü and Çambhu. This is the process. We cannot manufacture our own way of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is not that everything one manufactures or concocts will lead to understanding God. Such a proposition—yata mata, tata patha—is foolish. Kåñëa says, bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù: "Only by executing the activities of bhakti can one understand Me." (SB 11.14.21) This is called änukülyena kåñëänuçélanam [Cc. Madhya 19.167], remaining engaged favorably in the service of the Lord.
14. Brahmä's Prayers to Lord Kåñëa
This chapter describes the prayers Brahmä offered to Lord Kåñëa, who is also known as Nanda-nandana.
For His satisfaction, Brahmä first praised the beauty of the Lord's transcendental limbs and then declared that His original identity of sweetness is even more difficult to comprehend than His opulence. Only by the devotional process of hearing and chanting transcendental sounds received from Vedic authorities can one realize the Personality of Godhead. It is fruitless to try to realize God through processes outside the scope of Vedic authority.
The mystery of the Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, is inconceivable; it is even more difficult to understand than the impersonal Supreme. Thus only by the mercy of God can one understand His glories. Finally realizing this, Brahmä repeatedly condemned his own actions and recognized that Lord Çré Kåñëa, the ultimate shelter of the universe, is Brahmä's own father, the original Näräyaëa. In this way Brahmä begged the Lord's forgiveness.
Brahmä then glorified the inconceivable opulence of the Personality of Godhead and described the ways in which Brahmä and Çiva differ from Lord Viñëu, the reason for the Supreme Lord's appearance in various species of demigods, animals and so on, the eternal nature of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, and the temporality of the material world. By knowing the Supreme Personality in truth, the individual spirit soul can achieve liberation from bondage. In actuality, however, both liberation and bondage are unreal, for it is only from the living entity's conditioned outlook that his bondage and liberation are produced. Thinking the personal form of Lord Kåñëa illusory, fools reject His lotus feet and look elsewhere to find the Supreme Self. But the futility of their search is the obvious proof of their foolishness. There is simply no way to understand the truth of the Personality of Godhead without His mercy.
Having established this conclusion, Lord Brahmä analyzed the great good fortune of the residents of Vraja and then personally prayed to be born there even as a blade of grass, a bush or a creeper. Indeed, the homes of the residents of Våndävana are not prisons of material existence but rather abodes envied even by the jïänés and yogés. On the other hand, any home without a connection to Lord Kåñëa is in fact a prison cell of material existence. Finally, Brahmä offered his whole self at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and, praising Him again and again, circumambulated Him and took his leave.
Lord Kåñëa then gathered the animals Brahmä stole and led them to the place on the Yamunä's bank where the cowherd boys had been taking lunch. The same friends who had been present before were sitting there now. By the power of Kåñëa's illusory energy, they were not at all aware of what had happened. Thus when Kåñëa arrived with the calves, the boys told Him, "You've returned so quickly! Very good. As long as You were gone we couldn't take even a morsel of food, so come and eat."
Laughing at the words of the cowherd boys, Lord Kåñëa began taking His meal in their company. While eating, Kåñëa pointed out to His young friends the skin of the python, and the boys thought, "Kåñëa has just now killed this terrible snake." Indeed, later they related to the residents of Våndävana the incident of Kåñëa's killing the Agha demon. In this way, the cowherd boys described pastimes that Lord Kåñëa had performed in His bälya age (one to five), even though His paugaëòa age (six to ten) had begun.
Çukadeva Gosvämé concludes this chapter by explaining how the gopés loved Lord Kåñëa even more than they loved their own sons.

Wearing garlands of various forest flowers and leaves, and equipped with a herding stick, a buffalo horn and a flute, You stand beautifully with a morsel of food in Your hand.
In the previous chapter Brahmä, the creator of the universe, tried to bewilder the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, by stealing His cowherd boyfriends and calves. But by a slight exhibition of Kåñëa's own mystic potency, Brahmä himself was completely bewildered, and now with great humility and devotion he offers his humble obeisances and prayers unto the Lord.
The word kavala in this verse refers to a morsel of rice mixed with yogurt that Kåñëa held in His left hand. According to Sanätana Gosvämé, the Lord held a cowherding stick and a buffalo horn pressed under His left arm, and His flute was placed under His belt. Beautiful young Kåñëa, decorated with multicolored forest minerals, exhibited opulences far greater than those of Vaikuëöha. Although Brahmä had seen innumerable four-armed forms of the Lord, he now surrendered unto the lotus feet of the two-armed form of Kåñëa, who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja. Brahmä offered his prayers to that form.

asya—of this; api—even; deva—O Lord; vapuñaù—the body; mat-anugrahasya—which has shown mercy to me; sva-icchä-mayasya—which appears in response to the desires of Your pure devotees; na—not; tu—on the other hand; bhüta-mayasya—a product of matter; kaù—Brahmä; api—even; na éçe—I am not able; mahi—the potency; tu—indeed; avasitum—to estimate; manasä—with my mind; antareëa—which is controlled and withdrawn; säkñät—directly; tava—Your; eva—indeed; kim uta—what to speak; ätma—within Yourself; sukha—of happiness; anubhüteù—of Your experience.
My dear Lord, neither I nor anyone else can estimate the potency of this transcendental body of Yours, which has shown such mercy to me and which appears just to fulfill the desires of Your pure devotees. Although my mind is completely withdrawn from material affairs, I cannot understand Your personal form. How, then, could I possibly understand the happiness You experience within Yourself?
In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, Çréla Prabhupäda explains that in the present verse Lord Brahmä expressed the following prayerful sentiment: "Your appearance as a cowherd child is for the benefit of the devotees, and although I have committed an offense at Your lotus feet by stealing away Your boys and calves, I can understand that You have bestowed Your mercy upon me. This shows Your transcendental quality of being very affectionate toward Your devotees. But in spite of Your great affection for me, I cannot estimate the potency of Your bodily activities. It is to be understood that when I, Lord Brahmä, the supreme personality of this universe, cannot estimate the childlike body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what to speak of others? And if I cannot estimate the spiritual potency of Your childlike body, then what can I understand about Your transcendental pastimes? Therefore, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gétä, anyone who can understand a little of the transcendental pastimes, appearance and disappearance of the Lord immediately becomes eligible to enter the kingdom of God after quitting the material body. This statement is confirmed in the Vedas, where it is stated:  Simply by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the chain of repeated birth and death. I therefore recommend that people should not try to understand You by their speculative knowledge."
When Brahmä disrespected the supreme status of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa first bewildered him by exhibiting the Lord's own transcendental power. Then, having humbled His devotee Brahmä, Kåñëa gave him His personal audience.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body can also function through the agency of His plenary expansions, called viñëu-tattva. As stated by Brahmä himself in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.32): aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti. This verse indicates not only that the Lord can perform any bodily function with any of His limbs but also that He can see through the eyes of His Viñëu expansions or, indeed, through the eyes of any living entity, and similarly that He can hear through the ears of any Viñëu or jéva expansion. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that although the Lord can perform any function with any one of His senses, in His transcendental pastimes as Çré Kåñëa He generally sees with His eyes, touches with His hands, hears with His ears and so on. Thus He behaves like the most beautiful and charming young cowherd boy.
The Vedic knowledge expands from Lord Brahmä, who is described in the first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as ädi-kavi, the primeval Vedic scholar. Yet Brahmä could not understand the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa, because it is beyond the reach of ordinary Vedic knowledge. Among all the transcendental forms of the Lord, the two-armed form of Govinda-Kåñëa—is original and supreme. Thus Lord Govinda's pastimes of stealing butter, drinking the gopés' breast-milk, tending the calves, playing His flute and playing childhood sports are extraordinary even in comparison with the activities of the Lord's Viñëu expansions.

Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.
Here the word udapäsya clearly indicates that one should not even slightly endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by the process of mental speculation, for it invariably carries one to an imperfect, impersonal understanding of God. The word jévanti indicates that a devotee who always hears about Lord Kåñëa will go back home, back to Godhead, even if he can do nothing except maintain his existence and hear topics concerning the Lord.
Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has explained the words tanu-väì-manobhiù ("by the body, words and mind") in three ways. In reference to devotees, through their body, words and mind they are able to conquer Lord Kåñëa. Thus becoming perfect in Kåñëa consciousness, they can touch His lotus feet with their hands, call Him to come with their words, and attain His direct audience within their mind simply by thinking about Him.
In the case of nondevotees, the words tanu-väì-manobhiù refer to the word ajita, "unconquered," and indicate that those not engaged in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa cannot conquer the Absolute Truth by their bodily strength, verbal expertise or mental power. Despite all their endeavors, the ultimate truth remains beyond their reach.
In reference to the word jitaù, "conquered," the words tanu-väì-manobhiù indicate that the pure devotees of Lord Kåñëa conquer His body, words and mind. Lord Kåñëa's body is conquered because He always remains by the side of His pure devotees; Lord Kåñëa's words are conquered because He always chants the glories of His devotees; and Lord Kåñëa's mind is conquered because He always thinks about His loving devotees.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained the words tanu-väì-manobhiù in regard to the word namantaù, "offering obeisances." He explains that the devotees can take full advantage of the transcendental topics of the Lord by offering all respects to those topics with their body, words and mind. One should engage his body by touching the ground with his hands and head while offering obeisances to the topics of the Lord; one should engage his words by praising transcendental literatures such as Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as the devotees who are preaching such literatures; and one should engage his mind by feeling great reverence and pleasure while hearing the transcendental topics of the Lord. In this way, a sincere devotee who has acquired even a small amount of transcendental knowledge about Lord Kåñëa can conquer Him and thus go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life at the Lord's side.

My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the best path for self-realization. If someone gives up that path and engages in the cultivation of speculative knowledge, he will simply undergo a troublesome process and will not achieve his desired result. As a person who beats an empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble.
Loving service to the Supreme Person is the natural and eternal function of every living entity. If a person renounces his own constitutional function and instead laboriously seeks so-called enlightenment through impersonal, speculative knowledge, his result is simply the trouble and bother that come from following an artificial process. A fool may beat an empty husk, not knowing that the grain has already been removed. Similarly foolish is the person who throws his mind again and again into the pursuit of knowledge without surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the very substance and goal of knowledge, just as grain is the substance and goal of the entire agricultural effort. Vedic knowledge or, indeed, material science without the Personality of Godhead is exactly like an empty and useless husk of wheat.
One may argue that by practicing yoga or cultivating impersonal knowledge one can acquire prestige, wealth, mystic powers or even impersonal liberation. But these so-called gains are actually useless, because they do not situate the living being in his constitutional position of loving service to the Supreme Lord. Therefore such results, being superfluous to the living being's essential nature, are impermanent. As stated in the Nåsiàha Puräëa (62.19), patreñu puñpeñu phaleñu toyeñv akréta-labhyeñu vadaiva satsu/ bhaktyä su-labhye puruñe puräëe muktyai kim arthaà kriyate prayatnaù: "Since the primeval Personality of Godhead is easily attained by offering Him such things as leaves, flowers, fruits and water, which are all found without difficulty, why does one need to endeavor for liberation separately?"
Although the process of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa is very simple, it is extremely difficult for stubborn conditioned souls to completely humble themselves before the Supreme Personality of Godhead and absorb themselves twenty-four hours a day in His loving service. The mood of loving service is anathema to belligerent conditioned souls determined to defy God and enjoy. When such stubborn conditioned souls attempt to bypass surrendering to God through proud attempts at philosophical speculation, austerity, and yoga, they are turned back to the material platform by the powerful laws of God and violently merged into the heaving ocean of insignificance called the material world.

Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal feature. Nevertheless, it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.
It is difficult for conditioned souls to understand all the transcendental features of the Supreme Lord. As confirmed in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11): brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate. The transcendental existence of God is understood progressively as the impersonal effulgence, the localized Supersoul in one's heart, and finally the Supreme Personality of Godhead existing in His eternal abode. Lord Kåñëa's transcendental existence is beyond the qualities of material nature. Thus here the Lord is referred to as aguëasya, without material qualities.
Even by practicing yoga or engaging in advanced philosophical speculation, one will find it very difficult to understand clearly the transcendental existence beyond the modes of material nature. And these processes are virtually useless for understanding the Lord's own unlimited transcendental qualities, which are far beyond the impersonal conception of spiritual existence. Only by the mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord or by associating with the Lord Himself can one begin the process of realizing the personal feature of God—a process that culminates in pure Kåñëa consciousness, the final and supreme perfection of knowledge.

In time, learned philosophers or scientists might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the particles of snow, or perhaps even the shining molecules radiating from the sun, the stars and other luminaries. But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?
Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé explains that Lord Kåñëa is guëätmä, "the soul of all superior qualities," because He gives them life. For example, one may discuss in an abstract way such qualities as generosity, intelligence and mercy, but they come to life only when a living person exhibits them. Thus Lord Kåñëa is guëätmä because He descends to the material world and reestablishes religious principles by exhibiting all godly qualities Himself and inspiring them in others. A living entity who develops the transcendental qualities found in the Lord receives immeasurable benefit and eventually goes with the Lord back to His own abode, where all living beings are liberated and fully endowed with the transcendental nature.
Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé further explains that the Lord manifests a specific spiritual quality for the benefit of each living entity. Since there are innumerable living entities within the confines of the material creation, the Lord manifests infinite qualities. Thus every conditioned soul can appreciate the Supreme Lord in a particular way.
The example is given here that even if the most learned scholars could someday count the particles of earth, snow and light, they would still fail to understand the qualities of the Lord. In this example earth, snow and light are progressively more subtle; thus it is to be understood that there is an increasing difficulty in counting their virtually infinite particles.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, great personalities like Lord Saìkarñaëa actually have counted the number of atoms on the earth, and even the molecules in the entire universe. Yet even such a personality as Saìkarñaëa, who has been continuously chanting the glories of the Lord since time immemorial, has not even approached a final count of those glories.
Lord Kåñëa exhibits His most astonishing qualities during His childhood pastimes in Våndävana, where He steals butter from the cowherd ladies, dances with His girlfriends, and plays with His cowherd boyfriends as their most dear companion. Although appearing like ordinary human activities, such sublime pastimes embody Lord Kåñëa's immeasurable and innumerable beautiful transcendental qualities, which are the life and soul of the pure devotees.

My dear Lord, one who earnestly waits for You to bestow Your causeless mercy upon him, all the while patiently suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds and offering You respectful obeisances with his heart, words and body, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains in his commentary that just as a legitimate son has to simply remain alive to gain an inheritance from his father, one who simply remains alive in Kåñëa consciousness, following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, automatically becomes eligible to receive the mercy of the Personality of Godhead. In other words, he will be promoted to the kingdom of God.
The word su-samékñamäëa indicates that a devotee earnestly awaits the mercy of the Supreme Lord even while suffering the painful effects of previous sinful activities. Lord Kåñëa explains in the Bhagavad-gétä that a devotee who fully surrenders unto Him is no longer liable to suffer the reactions of his previous karma. However, because in his mind a devotee may still maintain the remnants of his previous sinful mentality, the Lord removes the last vestiges of the enjoying spirit by giving His devotee punishments that may sometimes resemble sinful reactions. The purpose of the entire creation of God is to rectify the living entity's tendency to enjoy without the Lord, and therefore the particular punishment given for a sinful activity is specifically designed to curtail the mentality that produced the activity. Although a devotee has surrendered to the Lord's devotional service, until he is completely perfect in Kåñëa consciousness he may maintain a slight inclination to enjoy the false happiness of this world. The Lord therefore creates a particular situation to eradicate this remaining enjoying spirit. This unhappiness suffered by a sincere devotee is not technically a karmic reaction; it is rather the Lord's special mercy for inducing His devotee to completely let go of the material world and return home, back to Godhead.
A sincere devotee earnestly desires to go back to the Lord's abode. Therefore he willingly accepts the Lord's merciful punishment and continues offering respects and obeisances to the Lord with his heart, words and body. Such a bona fide servant of the Lord, considering all hardship a small price to pay for gaining the personal association of the Lord, certainly becomes a legitimate son of God, as indicated here by the words däya-bhäk. Just as one cannot approach the sun without becoming fire, one cannot approach the supreme pure, Lord Kåñëa, without undergoing a rigid purificatory process, which may appear like suffering but which is in fact a curative treatment administered by the personal hand of the Lord.

My Lord, just see my uncivilized impudence! To test Your power I tried to extend my illusory potency to cover You, the unlimited and primeval Supersoul, who bewilder even the masters of illusion. What am I compared to You? I am just like a small spark in the presence of a great fire.
A great fire produces many sparks, which are insignificant in comparison to it. Indeed, if one of the small sparks were to try to burn the original fire, the attempt would be simply ludicrous. Similarly, even the creator of the entire universe, Lord Brahmä, is an insignificant spark of the potency of God, and therefore Brahmä's attempt to bewilder the Supreme Lord was certainly ludicrous.
Brahmä here addresses Lord Kåñëa as éça, which indicates that Kåñëa is not only the supreme master of everyone but is also specifically the master of Brahmä, who creates the universe directly under the guidance of the Lord and who, indeed, is born directly from the Lord's own body.
Brahmä felt ashamed of his impudent attempt at deluding Lord Kåñëa, and he was therefore perfectly willing to be punished or forgiven by the Lord, according to His decision. If Lord Kåñëa does not mercifully punish His devotees when they act improperly, their foolishness will simply increase and gradually completely overwhelm their devotional sentiments. Therefore Lord Kåñëa kindly disciplines His devotees and maintains them on the progressive path back home, back to Godhead.

Therefore, O infallible Lord, kindly excuse my offenses. I have taken birth in the mode of passion and am therefore simply foolish, presuming myself a controller independent of Your Lordship. My eyes are blinded by the darkness of ignorance, which causes me to think of myself as the unborn creator of the universe. But please consider that I am Your servant and therefore worthy of Your compassion.
In his commentary, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Brahmä wanted to present the following argument to the Lord: "My dear Lord, because I have acted so badly I certainly deserve to be punished. On the other hand, because I am so ignorant You should consider me an innocent fool and be merciful to me. Thus, although I deserve both punishment and forgiveness, I humbly beg You to exercise tolerance in this matter and simply forgive me and show me Your mercy."
The words näthavän iti indicate that Lord Brahmä wanted to humbly remind Lord Kåñëa that He was, after all, Brahmä's father and master and should therefore forgive the unfortunate transgressions of His humble servant. Every conditioned soul, whether he be Lord Brahmä or an insignificant ant, falsely identifies himself with the material world and in this way forgets his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmä, because of his prestigious position as the cosmic creator, also tends to identify himself as the lord of this world, and thus he sometimes forgets his position as an insignificant servant of the Supreme Lord. Now, by Lord Kåñëa's mercy, this false identification is being rectified and Lord Brahmä is remembering his constitutional position as the eternal servant of God.

In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Ädi-lélä, Chapter Five, Text 72, Çréla Prabhupäda gives the following purport for this verse: "When Lord Brahmä, after having stolen all Kåñëa's calves and cowherd boys, returned and saw that the calves and boys were still roaming with Kåñëa, he offered this prayer in his defeat. A conditioned soul—even one so great as Brahmä, who manages the affairs of the entire universe—cannot compare to the Personality of Godhead, for He can produce numberless universes simply by the spiritual rays emanating from the pores of His body. Material scientists should take lessons from the utterances of Çré Brahmä regarding our insignificance in comparison with God. In these prayers of Brahmä there is much to learn for those who are falsely puffed up by the accumulation of power."
In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, Çréla Prabhupäda further comments on this verse: "Lord Brahmä realized his actual position. He is certainly the supreme teacher of this universe, in charge of the production of material nature, consisting of the complete material energy, false ego, sky, air, fire, water and earth. Such a universe may be gigantic, but it can be measured, just as we measure our body as seven spans. Generally, everyone's personal bodily measurement is calculated to be seven spans of his hand. This particular universe may appear to be a very gigantic body, but it is nothing but the measurement of seven spans for Lord Brahmä.
"Aside from this universe, there are unlimited other universes outside the jurisdiction of this particular Lord Brahmä. Just as innumerable infinitesimal atomic fragments pass through the holes of a screened window, so millions and trillions of universes in their seedling form are coming out from the bodily pores of Mahä-Viñëu, and that Mahä-Viñëu is but a part of the plenary expansion of Kåñëa. Under these circumstances, although Lord Brahmä is the supreme creature within this universe, what is his importance in the presence of Lord Kåñëa?"

O Lord Adhokñaja, does a mother take offense when the child within her womb kicks with his legs? And is there anything in existence—whether designated by various philosophers as real or as unreal—that is actually outside Your abdomen?
Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows on this verse in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen: "Lord Brahmä therefore compared himself to a little child within the womb of his mother. If the child within the womb plays with his hands and legs, and while playing touches the body of the mother, is the mother offended with the child? Of course she isn't. Similarly, Lord Brahmä may be a very great personality, and yet not only Brahmä but everything that be is existing within the womb of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord's energy is all-pervading: there is no place in the creation where it is not acting. Since everything is existing within the energy of the Lord, the Brahmä of this universe or the Brahmäs of the many other millions and trillions of universes are existing within the energy of the Lord; therefore the Lord is considered to be the mother, and everything existing within the womb of the mother is considered to be the child. And the good mother is never offended with the child, even if he touches the body of the mother by kicking his legs."

My dear Lord, it is said that when the three planetary systems are merged into the water at the time of dissolution, Your plenary portion, Näräyaëa, lies down on the water, gradually a lotus flower grows from His navel, and Brahmä takes birth upon that lotus flower. Certainly, these words are not false. Thus am I not born from You?
Although every living being is a child of God, Lord Brahmä here makes a special claim because he takes birth on a lotus flower that emanates from the navel of Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead. Ultimately, all living beings are equally expansions of the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord. But Brahmä has an intimate relationship with the Lord because of the activities of universal creation, and so he uses the prefix vi in the word vinirgata to beg the Lord's special mercy. Lord Brahmä is called aja because he is not born from any mother but rather emanates directly from the body of the Lord. As Çréla Prabhupäda states in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, "It is naturally concluded that the mother of Brahmä is Näräyaëa." On these grounds, Lord Brahmä is requesting special forgiveness for his offenses.

Are You not the original Näräyaëa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Näräyaëa is Your expansion, and He is called Näräyaëa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Mäyä.
In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Ädi-lélä, Chapter Two, Text 30, Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: "This statement was spoken by Lord Brahmä in his prayers to Lord Kåñëa after Lord defeated him by displaying His mystic powers. Brahmä had tried to test Lord Kåñëa to see if He was really the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a cowherd boy. Brahmä stole all the other boys and their cows from the pasturing grounds, but when he returned to the pastures he saw that all the boys and cows were still there, for Lord Kåñëa had created them all again. When Brahmä saw this mystic power of Lord Kåñëa, he admitted defeat and offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the proprietor and seer of everything in the creation and as the Supersoul who is within each and every living entity and is dear to all. Lord Kåñëa is Näräyaëa, the father of Brahmä, because Lord Kåñëa's plenary expansion Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, after placing Himself on the Garbha Ocean, created Brahmä from His own body. Mahä-Viñëu in the Causal Ocean and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, are also transcendental expansions of the Supreme Truth."
In his commentary on this verse, Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has elaborately explained the expansion of the Viñëu, or Näräyaëa, incarnations from the original form of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa. The essence is that although Lord Brahmä was born from Lord Näräyaëa, Brahmä now understands that Näräyaëa is Himself a mere expansion of the original Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.

My dear Lord, if Your transcendental body, which shelters the entire universe, is actually lying upon the water, then why were You not seen by me when I searched for You? And why, though I could not envision You properly within my heart, did You then suddenly reveal Yourself?
Lord Brahmä here refers to his experience at the dawn of cosmic creation. As described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä took birth on the seat of a giant lotus whose stem emanated from the navel of Näräyaëa. Brahmä was bewildered as to his whereabouts, function and identity, and therefore he tried to trace out the source of the lotus stem, searching for clear information. Unable to find the Personality of Godhead, he returned to his seat and engaged in severe austerities, having been ordered to do so by the transcendental voice of the Lord, who could be heard but not seen. After long meditation, Brahmä saw the Lord but then again lost sight of Him. Thus Brahmä concludes that the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead is not material but rather an eternal, spiritual form endowed with inconceivable mystic potencies. In other words, Lord Brahmä should not have challenged the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of all mystic power.

My dear Lord, in this incarnation You have proved that You are the supreme controller of Mäyä. Although You are now within this universe, the whole universal creation is within Your transcendental body—a fact You demonstrated by exhibiting the universe within Your abdomen before Your mother, Yaçodä.
Lord Brahmä here describes the inconceivable spiritual potency of the Lord. We may find a pot within a house, but we can hardly expect to find the house within the same pot. By the Lord's spiritual potency, however, He can appear within this universe and simultaneously exhibit all the universes within His body. One may argue that since the universes seen by Mother Yaçodä within Lord Kåñëa's abdomen were within the Lord's body, they are different from the illusory material universes manifest externally. Here Lord Brahmä refutes that argument, however. Lord Kåñëa is mäyä-dhamana, the supreme controller of illusion. By the Lord's own supreme mystic potency, He can bewilder even illusion herself, and thus the Lord actually exhibited all the material universes within His body. This is mäyätvam, the supreme bewildering potency of the Personality of Godhead.

Have You not shown me today that both You Yourself and everything within this creation are manifestations of Your inconceivable potency? First You appeared alone, and then You manifested Yourself as all of Våndävana's calves and cowherd boys, Your friends. Next You appeared as an equal number of four-handed Viñëu forms, who were worshiped by all living beings, including me, and after that You appeared as an equal number of complete universes. Finally, You have now returned to Your unlimited form as the Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second.
As stated in the Vedic literature, sarvaà khalv idaà brahma: everything that exists is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is ultimately part and parcel of the Lord's spiritual existence. By Lord Kåñëa's causeless mercy, Lord Brahmä personally experienced that all existence, being the potency of God, is nondifferent from Him.

Although the impersonal Mäyävädé philosophers think that the demigods are illusory, Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu are stated here to be expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are thus real. Indeed, they are the extraordinarily powerful controllers of the universe. The ultimate truth is a supreme and beautiful person, and thus throughout the creation of God we will always find the personal touch.

O Lord, O supreme creator and master, You have no material birth, yet to defeat the false pride of the faithless demons and show mercy to Your saintly devotees, You take birth among the demigods, sages, human beings, animals and even the aquatics.
Among the demigods Lord Kåñëa appears in such forms as Vämanadeva, among the sages as Paraçuräma, among human beings as Lord Kåñëa Himself and as Lord Rämacandra, and among animals as the boar incarnation. Lord Kåñëa appears among the aquatics as Matsya, the gigantic fish. Indeed, the plenary expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are innumerable, as the Lord relentlessly comes down within the universes to smash the false pride of the atheists and show mercy to the saintly devotees.
In another sense, the Lord never appears, since He exists eternally. His appearance is like that of the sun, which is always present in the sky but which periodically appears to our vision.

O supreme great one! O Supreme Personality of Godhead! O Supersoul, master of all mystic power! Your pastimes are taking place continuously in these three worlds, but who can estimate where, how and when You are employing Your spiritual energy and performing these innumerable pastimes? No one can understand the mystery of how Your spiritual energy acts.
Brahmä previously stated that Lord Kåñëa incarnates among the demigods, human beings, animals, fish and so on. This does not mean, however, that the Lord is degraded by His incarnations. As Brahmä clarifies here, no conditioned soul can understand the transcendental nature of the Lord's activities, which He enacts through His spiritual potency. Although the Lord is bhüman, the supremely great one, He is still Bhagavän, the supremely beautiful personality exhibiting pastimes of love in His own abode. At the same time He is Paramätmä, the all-pervading Supersoul, who witnesses and sanctions all the activities of conditioned souls. The Lord's multiple identity is explained by the term yogeçvara. The Absolute Truth is the master of all mystic potencies, and although He is one and supreme, He manifests His greatness and opulence in many different ways.
Such elevated spiritual matters can hardly be understood by foolish persons primitively identifying themselves with the insignificant material body. These conditioned souls, such as atheistic scientists, consider their own puffed-up intelligence supreme. Gullibly placing their firm faith in material illusion, they are captured by the modes of nature and driven far away from knowledge of God.

Therefore this entire universe, which like a dream is by nature unreal, nevertheless appears real, and thus it covers one's consciousness and assails one with repeated miseries. This universe appears real because it is manifested by the potency of illusion emanating from You, whose unlimited transcendental forms are full of eternal happiness and knowledge.
As an object of enjoyment or a permanent residence for the conditioned souls, the material universe is certainly illusion, nothing more than a dream. One may give the analogy that the vision of abundant water in a desert is no more than a dream, although real water exists elsewhere. Similarly, the vision of home, happiness and reality within matter is certainly no better than a foolish dream in which repeated miseries appear.
In another sense, however, the universe is real. In his commentary on Vedänta-sütra, Çréla Madhväcärya has confirmed this by quoting the following statement from the Vedic çruti-mantras: satyaà hy evedaà viçvam asåjata. "This universe, created by the Lord, is real." The perfect authority of the Vedas thus certifies this universe to be real; nevertheless, because our knowledge is stolen by illusion (as indicated here by the words asta-dhiñaëam), we cannot properly understand this universe or the Supreme Lord who has created it. As the expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the universe is real and is meant for being engaged in His service. One who accepts the kingdom of God as home, the Lord Himself as the object of love, and the material universe as paraphernalia for being engaged in the Lord's service dwells within eternal reality wherever he may go within the material and spiritual worlds.

You are the one Supreme Soul, the primeval Supreme Personality, the Absolute Truth—self-manifested, endless and beginningless. You are eternal and infallible, perfect and complete, without any rival and free from all material designations. Your happiness can never be obstructed, nor have You any connection with material contamination. Indeed, You are the indestructible nectar of immortality.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains how the various terms of this verse demonstrate that the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa is free from the characteristics of material bodies. All material bodies go through six phases: birth, growth, maturity, reproduction, decline and destruction. But Lord Kåñëa does not take material birth, since He is the original reality, a fact clearly indicated here by the word ädya, "original." We take our material birth within a particular material atmosphere, in material bodies that are amalgamations of various material elements. Since Lord Kåñëa existed long before the creation of any material atmosphere or element, there is no question of material birth for His transcendental body.
Similarly, the word pürëa, meaning "full and complete," refutes the concept that Lord Kåñëa could grow, since He is ever-existing in fullness. When one's material body becomes mature, one can no longer enjoy as in youth; but the words ajasra-sukha, "enjoying unobstructed happiness," indicate that Lord Kåñëa's body never reaches so-called middle age, since it is always full of spiritual youthful bliss. The word akñara, "undiminishing," refutes the possibility that Lord Kåñëa's body grows old or declines, and the word amåta, "immortal," negates the possibility of death.
In other words, Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body is free from the transformations of material bodies. The Lord does, however, create innumerable worlds and expand Himself as innumerable living entities. But the Lord's so-called reproduction is completely spiritual and does not take place at a certain phase of bodily existence; rather, it constitutes the Lord's eternal proclivity to expand His spiritual bliss and glories.
As the Lord states in çruti, pürvam eväham ihäsam: "I alone existed in the beginning." Therefore here the Lord is called puruñaù puräëaù, "the primeval enjoyer. "This original puruña expands Himself as the Supersoul and enters every living being. Still, He is ultimately the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, as stated in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad: yaù säkñät para-brahmeti govindaà sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaà våndävana-sura-bhüruha-taläsénam. "The Absolute Truth Himself is Govinda, who has an eternal form of bliss and knowledge and who is sitting beneath the shady desire trees of Våndävana." This Absolute Truth is beyond material ignorance and beyond even ordinary spiritual knowledge, as stated in the same Gopäla-täpané çruti: vidyävidyäbhyäà bhinnaù. Thus, in many ways the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa has been established in the Vedic literature, and it is here confirmed by Lord Brahmä himself.

ätmänam—Yourself; eva—indeed; ätmatayä—as the Supreme Soul; avijänatäm—for those who do not understand; tena—by that; eva—alone; jätam—is generated; nikhilam—the entire; prapaïcitam—material existence; jïänena—by knowledge; bhüyaù api—once again; ca—and; tat—that material existence; praléyate—disappears; rajjväm—within a rope; aheù—of a snake; bhoga—of the body; bhava-abhavau—the apparent appearance and disappearance; yathä—just as.
A person who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful, but he then gives up his fear upon realizing that the so-called snake does not exist. Similarly, for those who fail to recognize You as the Supreme Soul of all souls, the expansive illusory material existence arises, but knowledge of You at once causes it to subside.
Those submerged in illusion see material existence as infinite, just as one who is submerged in water sees only water all around him. For example, material scientists and philosophers, submerged deep within the ocean of material illusion, imagine that material nature extends infinitely in all directions. In fact, the material creation is a finite ocean of ignorance in which foolish living entities, such as material scientists, are unceremoniously dunked by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
To be trapped in a world in which all things are born and die is certainly a fearful experience. Anyone trapped in a dark place naturally becomes fearful. Since material life is always covered by the darkness of ignorance, every conditioned soul is fearful. The material nature is not ultimate reality, and thus analysis of matter can never provide answers to ultimate questions. This dark, snakelike existence called material life immediately disappears as soon as one opens his eyes to the bright light of Kåñëa consciousness.

The conception of material bondage and the conception of liberation are both manifestations of ignorance. Being outside the scope of true knowledge, they cease to exist when one correctly understands that the pure spirit soul is distinct from matter and always fully conscious. At that time bondage and liberation no longer have any significance, just as day and night have no significance from the perspective of the sun.
Material bondage is illusion because the living entity actually has no real relationship with the material world. Because of false ego, the conditioned soul identifies himself with matter. Therefore so-called liberation is simply the giving up of an illusion rather than release from actual bondage. Yet even if we think that the suffering of material illusion is real and that liberation is thus a meaningful release from suffering, the mere absence of material existence is still insignificant compared to the achievement of factual spiritual life, which is the positive eternal reality opposed to the negative illusion of material life. Ultimately, Kåñëa consciousness, or pure love of Godhead, is the only significant, meaningful and permanent status for every living entity.
Since the darkness of night is caused by the absence of the sun, one would not experience night within the sun itself, nor would one experience individual days separated by nights. Similarly, within the pure living entity there is no material darkness and thus no experience of liberation from such darkness. When the conditioned soul comes to this platform of pure consciousness, he becomes fit to associate with the supreme pure, the Personality of Godhead Himself, in the Lord's own abode.

Just see the foolishness of those ignorant persons who consider You to be some separated manifestation of illusion and who consider the self, which is actually You, to be something else, the material body. Such fools conclude that the supreme soul is to be searched for somewhere outside Your supreme personality.
Lord Brahmä is amazed at the gross ignorance of conditioned souls who consider Lord Kåñëa's supreme spiritual body to be material. Ignorant of the spiritual form of the Lord, such persons also consider their own material bodies to be the self, and therefore they conclude that spiritual reality is to be found somewhere beyond the supreme personality of Lord Kåñëa. Sometimes such fools consider Lord Kåñëa to be one of many individual souls who together constitute a single impersonal spiritual entity. Unfortunately, such speculators are not inclined to hear from the Lord Himself or from the Lord's authorized representatives, such as Lord Brahmä. Because they whimsically speculate on the nature of the Supreme, their ultimate result is confusion and ignorance, which they euphemistically describe as "the mystery of life."

O unlimited Lord, the saintly devotees seek You out within their own bodies by rejecting everything separate from You. Indeed, how can discriminating persons appreciate the real nature of a rope lying before them until they refute the illusion that it is a snake?
One may argue that a person should cultivate self-realization and at the same time pursue sense gratification for the material body. This proposition is herein refuted by the example of misidentifying a rope as a snake. One who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful and thinks of the so-called snake. But upon discovering that the so-called snake is actually a rope, he experiences a different emotion—relief—and can then ignore the rope. Similarly, because we misunderstand the material body to be the self, we are experiencing many emotions in relation to the body. Upon discovering, however, that the body is simply a bag of material chemicals, we carefully note how this illusion was created and then lose interest in the body. Discovering that we are actually an eternal soul within the body, we naturally focus our attention on that real self.
Those who are saintly and wise always cultivate Kåñëa consciousness, spiritual knowledge, having transcended the foolish misidentification of the body as the self. Such Kåñëa conscious persons go on to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who dwells within the material body as the Supersoul—the witness and guide of every living entity. Realization of the Supersoul and the individual soul is so pleasing and satisfying that a self-realized person automatically gives up everything irrelevant to his spiritual advancement.

This translation is quoted from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta, Madhya-lélä, Chapter Six, Text 84.
Lord Kåñëa is very eager to bestow His mercy upon the conditioned living beings, who are uselessly struggling with the Lord's illusory energy, Mäyä. The conditioned soul struggles for happiness through sense gratification and for knowledge through mental speculation. Both processes ultimately bring him to a morose and hopeless condition. If the conditioned soul surrenders to the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa and thus acquires even a trace of His causeless mercy, the whole situation is changed, and the living entity can begin his real life of bliss and knowledge in Kåñëa consciousness.

My greatest possible good fortune would be to take any birth whatever in this forest of Gokula and have my head bathed by the dust falling from the lotus feet of any of its residents. Their entire life and soul is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, the dust of whose lotus feet is still being searched for in the Vedic mantras.
This verse indicates that Lord Brahmä desires to take birth even as the smallest blade of grass in Våndävana so that the holy residents of the Lord's abode may walk upon his head and bless him with the dust of their feet. Being realistic, Lord Brahmä does not aspire to directly achieve the dust of Lord Kåñëa's feet; rather, he aspires for the mercy of the Lord's devotees. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Brahmä is willing to take birth even as a stone in a paved footpath in the Lord's abode. Since Brahmä is the creator of the entire universe, we can just imagine the glorious position of the residents of Våndävana.
The Lord's devotees achieve their exalted position by unalloyed devotion and love. One cannot achieve such spiritual opulence by any puffed-up material process of personal improvement. In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda reveals the mind of Brahmä as follows: "But if I am not so fortunate as to take birth within the forest of Våndävana, I beg to be allowed to take birth outside the immediate area of Våndävana so that when the devotees go out they will walk over me. Even that would be a great fortune for me. I am just aspiring for a birth in which I will be smeared by the dust of the devotees' feet."

My dear Lord Kåñëa, until people become Your devotees, their material attachments and desires remain thieves, their homes remain prisons, and their affectionate feelings for their family members remain foot-shackles.
Apparently, the residents of Våndävana, the abode of Lord Kåñëa, are simple householders engaged in ordinary affairs such as herding cows, cooking, rearing children and performing religious ceremonies. However, all these activities are intensely engaged in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. The residents of Våndävana perform all activities in pure Kåñëa consciousness and thus exist on the most exalted platform of liberated life. Otherwise, the same activities performed without Kåñëa consciousness constitute ordinary bondage to the material world.
Thus, one should not misunderstand the exalted position of the residents of Våndävana, nor should one consider oneself highly religious simply because one performs ordinary domestic affairs very enthusiastically, but without Kåñëa consciousness. By focusing our passionate attachment on our family and society, we are completely deviated from the progressive path of Kåñëa consciousness. Conversely, if we engage our family in the loving service of the Lord, our endeavors to maintain our family become part and parcel of our progressive spiritual duties.
In conclusion, by studying the extraordinary status of the residents of Våndävana, we can see that the essential quality of their lives is pure Kåñëa consciousness—the rendering of loving service to the Lord without a trace of material desire or mental speculation. Such loving service to the original Personality of Godhead immediately creates the atmosphere of Çré Våndävana-dhäma, the kingdom of God.

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that just as a lamp does not seem to shine as brightly in sunlight as it does in the shade, or as a diamond does not seem as brilliant on a silver platter as it does on a plate of blue glass, the Lord's pastimes as Govinda do not seem as amazing in the transcendental abode of Vaikuëöha as they do within the material realm of Mäyä. Lord Kåñëa comes to the earth and acts toward His pure devotees exactly like a devoted son, boyfriend, husband, father, friend and so on, and within the darkness of material existence these brilliant, liberated pastimes give unlimited ecstasy to the surrendered devotees of the Lord.
In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda quotes Lord Brahmä as follows: "I can also understand that Your appearance as a small cowherd boy, a child of the cowherd men, is not at all a material activity. You are so much obliged by their affection that You are here to enthuse them with more loving service by Your transcendental presence. "

My dear Kåñëa, I now humbly request permission to leave. Actually, You are the knower and seer of all things. Indeed, You are the Lord of all the universes, and yet I offer this one universe unto You.
In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda has quoted Lord Brahmä as follows: "My dear Lord, although You are the Supreme Lord of all creation, I sometimes falsely think that I am the master of this universe. I may be master of this universe, but there are innumerable universes, and there are also innumerable Brahmäs who preside over these universes. But actually You are the master of them all. As the Supersoul in everyone's heart, You know everything. Please, therefore, accept me as Your surrendered servant. I hope that You will excuse me for disturbing You in Your pastimes with Your friends and calves. Now if You will kindly allow me, I will immediately leave so You can enjoy Your friends and calves without my presence."
The words sarvaà tvaà vetsi sarva-dåk are very significant here. Lord Kåñëa knows everything and sees everything, and therefore Lord Brahmä did not need to remain in Våndävana to maintain his personal loving contact with the Lord. In fact, as the creator of the universe, Lord Brahmä was somewhat out of place in the simple, blissful atmosphere of Våndävana, where Lord Kåñëa was exhibiting His supreme opulences in herding cows, enjoying picnics, playing games and so on.
Upon seeing the intense love the residents of Våndävana had for Lord Kåñëa, Brahmä felt unqualified to remain there. He was not eager to give up the Lord's association, but he felt it better to return to his personal devotional service in Brahmaloka. Somewhat embarrassed and unhappy over his foolish attempt at bewildering the Lord, Brahmä preferred to resume his transcendental loving service rather than try to enjoy the Lord's presence.

My dear Çré Kåñëa, You bestow happiness upon the lotuslike Våñëi dynasty and expand the great oceans consisting of the earth, the demigods, the brähmaëas and the cows. You dispel the dense darkness of irreligion and oppose the demons who have appeared on this earth. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, as long as this universe exists and as long as the sun shines, I will offer my obeisances unto You.
According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, Lord Brahmä is here engaged in the ecstasy of näma-saìkértana, glorifying various holy names of Lord Kåñëa that indicate His variegated pastimes. Lord Kåñëa expertly suppressed the demoniac population of the earth, which became unbearable with the advent of demoniac politicians like Kaàsa, Jaräsandha and Çiçupäla. Similarly, in modern society there are many so-called God-fearing people who are actually attracted to demoniac existence. Such persons become enlivened with the setting of the sun and go out in the darkness to enjoy life in restaurants, nightclubs, discotheques, hotels and so on, which are all simply meant for illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Then there are those who openly defy God and His laws, declaring themselves atheists and demons. Both the covert and the overt enemies of the Lord constitute an unholy burden for the earth, and Lord Kåñëa descends to expertly remove this burden.
Here Lord Brahmä indirectly states that Lord Kåñëa should remove Brahmä's own subtle atheism, which had led him to try to exert illusory power over Lord Kåñëa. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Brahmä, in his shame, felt himself to be like a brahma-räkñasa from Satyaloka who had come to the earth to disturb Lord Kåñëa and His intimate friends and calves. Brahmä is lamenting that although Lord Kåñëa is most exalted, the Lord of all lords, because He had appeared before Brahmä in such a simple and innocent feature—decorated with a stick, a conchshell, ornaments, red clay, a peacock feather and so on, and sporting with His cowherd boyfriends—Brahmä dared to challenge Him. Concerning Brahmä's prayers, of which this verse is the conclusion, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states, "May these prayers of Brahmä, which take away all doubts and broadcast all the definitive conclusions of devotional service, become the expert craftsmanship of the foundation of my consciousness."

The wives of the Käliya serpent said: The punishment this offender has been subjected to is certainly just. After all, You have incarnated within this world to curb down envious and cruel persons. You are so impartial that You look equally upon Your enemies and Your own sons, for when You impose a punishment on a living being You know it to be for his ultimate benefit.

What You have done here is actually mercy for us, since the punishment You give to the wicked certainly drives away all their contamination. Indeed, because this conditioned soul, our husband, is so sinful that he has assumed the body of a serpent, Your anger toward him is obviously to be understood as Your mercy.
Çréla Madhväcärya points out in this connection that when a pious person suffers in this world, he realizes, "The punishment the Supreme Lord is meting out to me is actually His causeless mercy." Envious persons, however, even after being punished by the Lord for their purification, continue to envy Him and be resentful, and this attitude is the reason for their continued failure to understand the Absolute Truth.

Did our husband carefully perform austerities in a previous life, with his mind free of pride and full of respect for others? Is that why You are pleased with him? Or did he in some previous existence carefully execute religious duties with compassion for all living beings, and is that why You, the life of all living beings, are now satisfied with him?
In this regard Çréla Prabhupäda comments in his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Sixteen: "The Näga-patnés confirm that one cannot come in contact with Kåñëa without having executed pious activities in devotional service in one's previous lives. As Lord Caitanya advised in His Çikñäñöaka, one has to execute devotional service by humbly chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street and not expecting honor for oneself but offering all kinds of honor to others. The Näga-patnés were astonished that, although Käliya had the body of a serpent as the result of grievous sinful activities, at the same time he was in contact with the Lord to the extent that the Lord's lotus feet were touching his hoods, a blessing that must certainly be the result of extraordinary pious activities. These two contradictory facts astonished them."

O Lord, although this Käliya, the king of the serpents, has taken birth in the mode of ignorance and is controlled by anger, he has achieved that which is difficult for others to achieve. Embodied souls, who are full of desires and are thus wandering in the cycle of birth and death, can have all benedictions manifested before their eyes simply by receiving the dust of Your lotus feet.
It is very rare for a conditioned soul to free himself from the contamination of illusion and thus become established in perfect consciousness of the Absolute Truth. And yet this benediction was achieved by the serpent Käliya because the Lord personally danced upon the serpent's hoods with His lotus feet. Although we conditioned souls may not receive the mercy of having the Lord dance on our head, we can receive the dust of the lotus feet of the Absolute through the Lord's representative, the bona fide spiritual master, and thus go back home, back to Godhead, forever freed from the misery and ignorance of the mundane universe.

Although the original shelter of all created material elements, You exist prior to their creation. And although the cause of everything, You are transcendental to all material cause and effect, being the Supreme Soul.

Obeisances unto You, the Absolute Truth, who are the reservoir of all transcendental consciousness and potency and the possessor of unlimited energies. Although completely free of material qualities and transformations, You are the prime mover of material nature.
Those who consider themselves intellectual, philosophic or rational should carefully note here that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ocean of all knowledge and consciousness. Thus surrendering unto the Supreme Lord does not entail giving up the method of rationally comprehending reality. Rather, one merges into the ocean of rational, logical comprehension. The Supreme Lord is the perfection of all sciences and all forms of knowledge, and only envious and trivial minds would deny this obvious fact.

We offer our obeisances again and again to You, who are the basis of all authoritative evidence, who are the author and ultimate source of the revealed scriptures, and who have manifested Yourself in those Vedic literatures encouraging sense gratification as well as in those encouraging renunciation of the material world.
If we did not have the powers of perception and cognition, evidence could not be transmitted, and if we had no tendency to believe in particular modes of evidence, persuasion could not take place. All of these processes—perception, cognition, persuasion and transmission—take place through the various potencies of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is Himself the greatest scholar and intellectual being. He manifests the transcendental scriptures within the hearts of great devotees like Brahmä and Närada, and in addition He incarnates as Vedavyäsa, the compiler of all Vedic knowledge. In multifarious ways the Lord generates a variety of religious scriptures, which gradually bring the conditioned souls through the various phases of re-entry into the kingdom of God.

Obeisances to You, O Lord, who manifest varieties of material and spiritual qualities. You disguise Yourself with the material qualities, and yet the functioning of those same material qualities ultimately reveals Your existence. You stand apart from the material qualities as a witness and can be fully known only by Your devotees.
The word guëa conveys various meanings: the three basic qualities of material nature, i.e., goodness, passion and ignorance; excellent qualities one manifests because of piety and spiritual achievement; or the internal senses, such as the mind and intelligence. The word pradépäya means "unto Him who manifests or illumines." Thus here the Näga-patnés are addressing the Supreme Lord as "He who manifests all material and spiritual qualities and who causes the living entities to be conscious." One can see the Lord by going beyond the screen of material nature, and therefore He is called guëätma-cchädanäya. If one methodically and intelligently studies the functioning of the material qualities, he will ultimately conclude that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He exhibits His illusory potency to bewilder those who do not surrender unto Him.
The Lord is never affected by the modes of nature, being their witness, and thus He is called guëa-drañöre. The word sva indicates "one's own," and thus sva-saàvide means that Lord Kåñëa can be known only by His own people, the devotees, and also that ultimately only the Lord can know Himself perfectly. Therefore we should take Lord Kåñëa's instructions in the Bhagavad-gétä and immediately come to the right conclusion: full surrender to the Lord's lotus feet. Thus we should humbly glorify the Lord, following the example of the Näga-patnés.

O almighty Lord, although You have no reason to become involved in material activity, still You act through Your eternal potency of time to arrange for the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe. You do this by awakening the distinct functions of each of the modes of nature, which before the creation lie dormant. Simply by Your glance You perfectly execute all these activities of cosmic control in a sporting mood.
Sceptics may question why the Supreme Lord has created the material world, which is full of birth, maintenance and death. Here the Näga-patnés point out that the Lord's pastimes are amogha, beyond any discrepancy. Çré Kåñëa actually desires that all conditioned souls live with Him in His eternal kingdom, but those forgetful souls who are inimical to their loving relationship with God must go to the material world and be subjected to the conditions of time. The fortunate conditioned souls are startled into remembrance of their actual position as loving servants of the Lord, and from within the heart the Lord then encourages them to come back home, back to Godhead, where time is conspicuous by its absence and where eternal, blissful existence supersedes the dramatic but disturbing functions of cosmic creation and annihilation.

Therefore all material bodies throughout the three worlds—those that are peaceful, in the mode of goodness; those that are agitated, in the mode of passion; and those that are foolish, in the mode of ignorance—all are Your creations. Still, those living entities whose bodies are in the mode of goodness are especially dear to You, and it is to maintain them and protect their religious principles that You are now present on the earth.

At least once, a master should tolerate an offense committed by his child or subject. O supreme peaceful Soul, You should therefore forgive our foolish husband, who did not understand who You are.
Because of their extreme anxiety, in this verse Käliya's wives mention the same idea twice: that the Supreme Lord should kindly forgive their foolish husband. The Supreme Lord is çäntätmä, the supreme peaceful Soul, and therefore the Näga-patnés suggest it would be proper for Him to overlook, at least this once, the great offense committed by the ignorant Käliya.

The serpent Käliya said: Our very birth as a snake has made us envious, ignorant and constantly angry. O my Lord, it is so difficult for people to give up their conditioned nature, by which they identify with that which is unreal.
Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé points out that because of his wretched condition, Käliya was unable to compose original prayers to the Lord, and thus he paraphrased some of the prayers offered by his wives. The word asad-graha indicates that a conditioned soul seizes upon impermanent and impure things such as his own body, the bodies of others, and other countless varieties of material sense objects. The ultimate result of such material attachment is frustration, disappointment and anguish—a fact that has now become crystal clear to the poor serpent Käliya.

Commenting on this verse, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the Närada Puräëa as follows: "From Hiraëyagarbha, Brahmä, comes the second creation of this universe, but the universe is primarily created by Viñëu Himself. Viñëu is thus the primary creator, and four-headed Brahmä is merely the secondary creator."

Käliya is here indirectly begging for the Lord's mercy, realizing that on his own he can never become free from illusion and suffering. Only by surrendering to the Lord and obtaining His mercy can one be released from the painful conditions of material life.

The cowherd girls said: O friends, those eyes that see the beautiful faces of the sons of Mahäräja Nanda are certainly fortunate. As these two sons enter the forest, surrounded by Their friends, driving the cows before Them, They hold Their flutes to Their mouths and glance lovingly upon the residents of Våndävana. For those who have eyes, we think there is no greater object of vision.
This translation is quoted from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi-lélä 4.155).
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has commented as follows: "The gopés meant to say, 'O friends, if you simply remain in the shackles of family life in this material world, what will you ever get to see? The creator has granted us these eyes, so let us see the most wonderful thing there is to see, Kåñëa.' "
The gopés were aware that their mothers or other elder persons might hear their romantic words and disapprove, and thus they said, akñaëvatäà phalam: "To see Kåñëa is the goal for all persons and not simply ourselves." In other words, the gopés indicated that since Kåñëa is the supreme object of love for everyone, why couldn't they also love Him in spiritual ecstasy?
According to the äcäryas, a different gopé spoke this and each of the following verses (through Text 19).

Dressed in a charming variety of garments, upon which Their garlands rest, and decorating Themselves with peacock feathers, lotuses, lilies, newly grown mango sprouts and clusters of flower buds, Kåñëa and Balaräma shine forth magnificently among the assembly of cowherd boys. They look just like the best of dancers appearing on a dramatic stage, and sometimes They sing.
The gopés continue singing their ecstatic song as they remember the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. The gopés wanted to go to the forest where Kåñëa was performing His pastimes and, while remaining concealed, peer through the leaves of the creepers and see the wonder of Kåñëa and Balaräma dancing and singing with Their boyfriends. This was their desire, but because they could not go, they sang this song in ecstatic love.

My dear gopés, what auspicious activities must the flute have performed to enjoy the nectar of Kåñëa's lips independently and leave only a taste for us gopés, for whom that nectar is actually meant! The forefathers of the flute, the bamboo trees, shed tears of pleasure. His mother, the river on whose bank the bamboo was born, feels jubilation, and therefore her blooming lotus flowers are standing like hair on her body.
This translation is quoted from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 16.140).
In the guise of releasing flowing sap, the bamboo trees are actually crying tears of ecstasy upon seeing their child become an exalted devotee-flute of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa.
Sanätana Gosvämé gives an alternate explanation: The trees are crying because they are unhappy at not being able to play with Kåñëa themselves. One may object that the trees in Våndävana should not lament for that which is impossible for them to obtain, just as a beggar certainly doesn't lament because he is forbidden to meet the king. But the trees are actually just like intelligent persons who suffer when they cannot obtain the goal of life. Thus the trees are crying because they cannot get the nectar of Kåñëa's lips.

O friend, Våndävana is spreading the glory of the earth, having obtained the treasure of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, the son of Devaké. The peacocks dance madly when they hear Govinda's flute, and when other creatures see them from the hilltops, they all become stunned.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that because activities such as those described in this verse do not occur in any other world, the earth is unique. In fact, the earth's glories are being spread by wonderful Våndävana because it is the place of Kåñëa's pastimes.
The name Devaké also refers to Mother Yaçodä, as stated in the Båhad-viñëu Puräëa:
dve nämné nanda-bhäryäyä
yaçodä devakéti ca
ataù sakhyam abhüt tasya
devakyä çauri-jäyayä
"The wife of Nanda had two names, Yaçodä and also Devaké. Therefore it was natural that she [the wife of Nanda] develop friendship with Devaké, the wife of Çauri [Vasudeva]."
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains kåñëa-lélä as follows: "In Våndävana, the peacocks request Kåñëa, 'Govinda, please make us dance.' Thus Kåñëa plays His flute, and they surround Him in a circle and dance in time with the rhythm of His melody. And while standing in the midst of their dancing, He also sings and dances. Then those peacocks, who are fully satisfied with His musical performance, out of gratitude offer for His pleasure their own divine feathers. In the usual manner of musical performers, Kåñëa gladly accepts these presentations and places a feather upon the turban atop His head. Gentle animals such as deer and doves greatly relish the transcendental entertainment presented by Kåñëa, and to get a good view they flock to the peaks of hills. Then, as they watch the breathtaking program, they become stunned in ecstasy."
Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé comments that because in Våndävana Kåñëa goes barefoot and can thus directly mark the earth with the symbols of His lotus feet, that transcendental land is even more glorious than Vaikuëöha, where Viñëu wears slippers.

Blessed are all these foolish deer because they have approached Mahäräja Nanda's son, who is gorgeously dressed and is playing on His flute. Indeed, both the doe and the bucks worship the Lord with looks of love and affection.
This translation is quoted from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 17.36).
According to the äcäryas, the gopés were thinking as follows: "The female deer can approach Kåñëa along with their husbands because Kåñëa is the ultimate object of affection for the male deer. Because of their affection for Kåñëa, they are encouraged by seeing their wives attracted to Him and thus consider their household lives fortunate. Indeed, they become joyful upon seeing how their wives are searching after Kåñëa, and, following along, they urge their wives to go to the Lord. On the other hand, our husbands are jealous of Kåñëa, and because of their lack of devotion to Him they cannot even stand to smell His fragrance. Therefore what is the use of our lives?"

Kåñëa's beauty and character create a festival for all women. Indeed, when the demigods' wives flying in airplanes with their husbands catch sight of Him and hear His resonant flute-song, their hearts are shaken by Cupid, and they become so bewildered that the flowers fall out of their hair and their belts loosen.
In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments: "[This verse indicates] that the transcendental sound of the flute of Kåñëa extended to all corners of the universe. Also, it is significant that the gopés knew about the different kinds of airplanes flying in the sky."
In fact, even while sitting on the laps of their demigod husbands, the demigoddesses became agitated by hearing the sounds of Kåñëa's flute. Thus the gopés thought that they themselves should not be blamed for their ecstatic conjugal attraction for Kåñëa, who after all was a cowherd boy from their own village and thus a natural object of their love. If even demigoddesses became mad after Kåñëa, how could poor, earthly cowherd girls from Kåñëa's own village avoid having their hearts completely conquered by His loving glances and the sounds of His flute?
The gopés also considered that the demigods, although noting their wives' attraction to Kåñëa, did not become envious. The demigods are actually very refined in culture and intelligence, and therefore when flying in their airplanes they regularly take their wives along to see Kåñëa. The gopés thought, "Our husbands, on the other hand, are envious. Therefore even the inferior deer are better off than we, and the demigoddesses are also very fortunate, whereas we poor human beings in an intermediate position are most unfortunate."

O mother, in this forest all the birds have risen onto the beautiful branches of the trees to see Kåñëa. With closed eyes they are simply listening in silence to the sweet vibrations of His flute, and they are not attracted by any other sound. Surely these birds are on the same level as great sages.
The birds resemble sages because they live in the forest, keep their eyes closed, observe silence and remain motionless. Significantly, it is stated here that even great sages become maddened by the sound of Kåñëa's flute, which is a completely spiritual vibration.
The word rucira-pravälän indicates that even the branches of the trees are transformed in ecstasy when struck by the vibration of Kåñëa's flute-song. Indra, Brahmä, Çiva and Viñëu, being primordial gods, travel throughout the universe and have extensive knowledge of the science of music, and yet even these great personalities have never heard or composed music like that which emanates from Kåñëa's flute. Indeed, the birds are so moved by the blissful sound that in their ecstasy they close their eyes and cling to the branches to avoid falling off the trees.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the gopés would sometimes address each other as amba, "mother."

Then with the arms of their waves the rivers embrace Muräri's lotus feet and, holding on to them, present offerings of lotus flowers.
Even such sacred bodies of water as the Yamunä and the Mänasa-gaìgä are enchanted by the flute-song, and thus they are disturbed by conjugal attraction for young Kåñëa. The gopés are implying that since many different types of living beings are overwhelmed by conjugal love for Kåñëa, why should the gopés be criticized for their intense desire to serve Kåñëa in the conjugal relationship?

In the company of Balaräma and the cowherd boys, Lord Kåñëa is continually vibrating His flute as He herds all the animals of Vraja, even under the full heat of the summer sun. Seeing this, the cloud in the sky has expanded himself out of love. He is rising high and constructing out of his own body, with its multitude of flower-like droplets of water, an umbrella for the sake of his friend.
Çréla Prabhupäda states in his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: "The scorching heat of the autumn sunshine was sometimes intolerable, and therefore the clouds in the sky appeared in sympathy above Kåñëa and Balaräma and Their boyfriends while They engaged in blowing Their flutes. The clouds served as a soothing umbrella over Their heads just to make friendship with Kåñëa."

The aborigine women of the Våndävana area become disturbed by lust when they see the grass marked with reddish kuìkuma powder. Endowed with the color of Kåñëa's lotus feet, this powder originally decorated the breasts of His beloveds, and when the aborigine women smear it on their faces and breasts, they feel fully satisfied and give up all their anxiety.
Çréla Prabhupäda explains this verse as follows: "The aborigine girls became fully satisfied when they smeared their faces and breasts with the dust of Våndävana, which was reddish from the touch of Kåñëa’s lotus feet. The aborigine girls had very full breasts, and they were also very lusty, but when their lovers touched their breasts, the girls were not very much satisfied. When they came out into the midst of the forest, they saw that while Kåñëa was walking some of the leaves and creepers of Våndävana had turned reddish from the kuìkuma powder which fell from His lotus feet. His lotus feet are held by the gopés on their breasts, which are smeared with kuìkuma powder, but when Kåñëa travels in the Våndävana forest with Balaräma and His boyfriends, the reddish powder falls on the ground. So the lusty aborigine girls, while looking toward Kåñëa playing His flute, saw the reddish kuìkuma on the ground and immediately took it and smeared it over their faces and breasts. In this way they became fully satisfied, although they were not satisfied when their lovers touched their breasts. All material lusty desires can be immediately satisfied if one comes in contact with Kåñëa consciousness."

Of all the devotees, this Govardhana Hill is the best! O my friends, this hill supplies Kåñëa and Balaräma, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, with all kinds of necessities—water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.
This translation is quoted from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 18.34).
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains the opulence of Govardhana Hill as follows: Pänéya refers to the fragrant, cool water from the Govardhana waterfalls, which Kåñëa and Balaräma drink and use to wash Their feet and mouths. Govardhana also offers other beverages, such as honey, mango juice and pélu juice. Süyavasa indicates dürvä grass, used to make the religious offering of arghya. Govardhana also has grass that is fragrant, soft and conducive to the strong growth of cows and increased production of milk. Thus this grass is used for feeding the transcendental herds. Kandara refers to the caves where Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their friends play, sit and lie down. These caves give pleasure when the weather is too hot or too cold, or when it is raining. Govardhana also features soft roots for eating, jewels for ornamenting the body, flat places for sitting, and lamps and mirrors in the form of smooth stones, glistening water and other natural substances.

My dear friends, as Kåñëa and Balaräma pass through the forest with Their cowherd friends, leading Their cows, They carry ropes to bind the cows' rear legs at the time of milking. When Lord Kåñëa plays on His flute, the sweet music causes the moving living entities to become stunned and the nonmoving trees to tremble with ecstasy. These things are certainly very wonderful.
Kåñëa and Balaräma would sometimes wear Their cowherding ropes on Their heads and sometimes carry them on Their shoulders, and thus They were beautifully decorated with all the equipment of cowherd boys.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the ropes of Kåñëa and Balaräma are made of yellow cloth and have clusters of pearls at both ends. Sometimes They wear these ropes around Their turbans, and the ropes thus become wonderful decorations.

The wives of the brähmaëas replied: O almighty one, please do not speak such cruel words. Rather, You should fulfill Your promise that You always reciprocate with Your devotees in kind. Now that we have attained Your lotus feet, we simply wish to remain here in the forest so we may carry upon our heads the garlands of tulasé leaves that fall from Your lotus feet. We are ready to give up all material relationships.
Here the brähmaëas' wives are saying something similar to what the gopés say at the beginning of the räsa dance (SB 10.29.31), when Lord Kåñëa tells them to go home as well. Like this verse, the gopés' statement begins with the words maivaà vibho 'rhati bhavän gadituà nå-çaàsam.
Nigama refers to the Vedic literature, which states that one who surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord does not return to this material world. Thus the brähmaëas' wives appealed to the Lord that since they had surrendered to Him, it was unfair for Him to order them to return to their materialistic husbands.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa might have pointed out to the brähmaëas' wives, "You young ladies are members of the aristocratic brähmaëa community, so how can you surrender at the feet of a mere cowherd boy?"
To this the ladies might have replied, "Since we have already surrendered at Your lotus feet, and since we desire to become Your servants, we are obviously not maintaining a false identification as members of the so-called brähmaëa community. You can easily ascertain this from our words."
Lord Kåñëa might have replied, "I am a cowherd boy, and My proper maidservants and girlfriends are the cowherd girls, the gopés."
The wives might have answered, "True, let them be so. Let them shine forth if You are embarrassed in front of Your relatives to make brähmaëa ladies Your maidservants. We certainly don't want to embarrass You. We will not go to Your village but will rather remain in Våndävana, like presiding deities of the forest. We simply desire to perfect our lives by even a slight trace of connection with You."
Thus by the spiritual insight of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, we learn that the brähmaëas' wives offered to remain at a distance and simply take the tulasé leaves that would fall from the lotus feet of Kåñëa or be crushed by the feet of His girlfriends when He would embrace them. The ladies offered to carry these tulasé leaves upon their heads. Thus renouncing the desire to become Kåñëa's intimate girlfriends or maidservants (a position they knew was difficult to achieve), the young brähmaëa ladies begged to remain in Våndävana forest. If the Lord had then asked, "Then what will your family members say?" they would have replied, "We have already transcended our so-called relatives because we are seeing You, the Supreme Lord, face to face."

Our husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, other relatives and friends will no longer take us back, and how could anyone else be willing to give us shelter? Therefore, since we have thrown ourselves at Your lotus feet and have no other destination, please, O chastiser of enemies, grant our desire.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows: "From their very youth the brähmaëas' wives had heard about Lord Kåñëa's beauty, qualities and sweetness from the womenfolk of Våndävana village, and also from the flower ladies, the betel-nut sellers and others. Consequently they always felt ecstatic love for Kåñëa and were indifferent to their household duties. Their husbands, seeing them as deviant, doubted them and avoided dealing with them as far as possible. Now the wives of the brähmaëas were ready to formally reject their so-called families and neighbors, and out of great agitation they were crying and placing their heads upon Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet, offering obeisances. In this way, with choking voices, they spoke the above verse. They begged that Lord Kåñëa bestow upon them the benediction that He be their only destination, that He, the chastiser of enemies, subdue all their enemies—those difficulties obstructing them from attaining the Lord."
The wives of the brähmaëas simply wanted to serve Lord Kåñëa, and this is pure Kåñëa consciousness in ecstatic love of Godhead.

King Indra said: Your transcendental form, a manifestation of pure goodness, is undisturbed by change, shining with knowledge and devoid of passion and ignorance. In You does not exist the mighty flow of the modes of material nature, which is based on illusion and ignorance.
The great Bhägavatam commentator Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has masterfully explained the Sanskrit elements of this profound verse.
The Sanskrit word dhäma has several meanings: a) a dwelling place, house, abode and so on, b) a favorite thing or person; delight; or pleasure, c) form or appearance, or d) power, strength, majesty, glory, splendor or light.
Concerning the first set of meanings, the Vedänta-sütra states that the Absolute Truth is the source and resting place of all existence, and in the first verse of the Bhägavatam that Absolute Truth is said to be Kåñëa. Although Lord Kåñëa exists in His own dhäma, or abode, called Kåñëaloka, He Himself is the abode of all existence, as Arjuna confirms in the Bhagavad-gétä, where he addresses Kåñëa as paraà dhäma, "the supreme abode."
The very name Kåñëa indicates the all-attractive person, and thus Lord Kåñëa, the source of all beauty and pleasure, is certainly "the favorite thing or person; delight; and pleasure." Ultimately these terms can refer only to Kåñëa.
Dhäma also refers to form or appearance, and as Indra offered these prayers he was in fact directly seeing the form of Kåñëa before him.
As clearly explained in the Vedic literature, Lord Kåñëa's power, strength, majesty, splendor and effulgence are all contained within His transcendental body and thus attest to the infinite glories of the Lord.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has brilliantly summarized all these meanings of the word dhäma by giving the Sanskrit term svarüpa as a synonym. The word svarüpa means "one's own form or shape" and also "one's own condition, character or nature." Since Lord Kåñëa, being pure spirit, is nondifferent from His body, there is absolutely no difference between the Lord and His visible form. By contrast, in this material world we conditioned souls are all distinctly different from our bodies, whether those bodies be male, female, black, white or whatever. All of us are eternal souls, different from our temporary, flimsy bodies.
When the word svarüpa is applied to us, it especially indicates our spiritual form, because our "own form" is in fact our "own condition, character or nature" eternally. Thus the liberated condition in which one's outward form is one's deepest spiritual nature is called svarüpa. Primarily, however, this term refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This is all indicated in this verse by the words tava dhäma, as explained by Çrédhara Svämé.
 Çrédhara Svämé has explained that here the word çäntam means "always in the same form." Çäntam can also mean "undisturbed, free from passion, or purified." According to Vedic philosophy, all change in this world is caused by the influence of passion and ignorance. The passionate mode is creative, and the ignorant mode is destructive, whereas the mode of goodness, sattva, is serene and sustaining. In many ways this verse emphasizes that Lord Kåñëa is free from the modes of nature. The words viçuddha-sattvam, çäntam, dhvasta-rajas-tamaskam and guëa-sampraväho na vidyate te all indicate this. Unlike Kåñëa, we change from one body to another because of our involvement with the modes of nature; the various transformations of material forms are impelled by the modes of nature, which are themselves set in motion by the influence of time. Therefore one who is free from the material modes of nature is changeless and eternally satisfied in blissful spiritual existence. Thus the word çäntam indicates that the Lord is undisturbed by change, since He is free from the material modes of nature.
According to this verse, the powerful flow of the material modes of nature—namely passion, stupidity and mundane piety—are based on agrahaëa, which Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated as "ignorance." Since the Sanskrit root graù means "to take, accept, grasp or comprehend," grahaëa means "grasp" exactly in the sense of "to grasp an idea or fact." Therefore agrahaëa here means one's failure to understand one's spiritual position, and this failure causes one to fall into the violent currents of material existence.
An additional meaning of the word agrahaëa is derived when it is divided into the compound agra-haëa. Agra means "the first, top or best," and hana means "killing." The best part of our existence is the pure soul, which is eternal, in contradistinction to the temporary, material body and mind. Thus one who chooses material existence over Kåñëa consciousness is in fact killing the best part of himself, the soul, which in its pure state can enjoy Kåñëa consciousness unlimitedly.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated tapo-mayam as "full of knowledge." The word tapas, generally indicating "austerity," is derived from the Sanskrit verb tap, whose meaning can be summarized as indicating the various functions of the sun. Tap means "to burn, to shine, to heat and so on." The Supreme Lord is eternally perfect, and therefore here tapo-mayam does not indicate that His transcendental body is meant for austerities, since austerities are performed by conditioned souls to purify themselves or to acquire a particular power. An omnipotent, perfect being neither purifies Himself nor acquires power: He is eternally pure and all-powerful. Therefore Çrédhara Svämé has intelligently understood that in this case the word tapas refers to the illuminating function of the sun and thus indicates that the Lord's self-effulgent body is omniscient. Light is a common symbol of knowledge. The Lord's spiritual effulgence does not merely illuminate physically, as in the case of a candle or light bulb; more importantly, the Lord's body illuminates our consciousness with perfect knowledge because the Lord's effulgence is itself perfect knowledge.
We offer our respectful obeisances at the lotus feet of Çréla Çrédhara Svämé and thank him for his enlightening comments on this verse.

How, then, could there exist in You the symptoms of an ignorant person—such as greed, lust, anger and envy—which are produced by one's previous involvement in material existence and which cause one to become further entangled in material existence? And yet as the Supreme Lord You impose punishment to protect religious principles and curb down the wicked.
This complex philosophical statement by Indra may be analyzed as follows: In the first line of this verse, Indra refers to the main idea expressed at the end of the previous verse—namely, that the great currents of material existence, which are based on ignorance, cannot possibly exist within the Supreme Lord. The words tad-dhetavaù and tat-kåtäù indicate that something causes the modes of nature to manifest, and that they in turn become the cause of that which caused them. In the second line of this verse, we find that it is material feelings such as greed, lust, envy and anger that cause the modes of nature to manifest and that are themselves caused by the modes of nature.
The explanation of this seeming paradox is as follows: When the conditioned soul decides to associate with the material qualities, he becomes contaminated by those qualities. As stated in the Gétä (13.22), käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu. For example, in the presence of a seductive woman, a man may give in to his lower instincts and try to enjoy sex with her. By his deciding to associate with the lower qualities of nature, those qualities manifest in him very powerfully. He is overwhelmed with lust and driven to try again and again to satisfy his burning desire. Because his mind has been infected by lust, all that he does, thinks and speaks will be influenced by his strong attachment to sex. In other words, by choosing to associate with the lusty qualities of nature, he has caused them to powerfully manifest within himself, and eventually those lusty qualities themselves will cause him to accept another material body suitable for affairs governed by those qualities.
The lower qualities, such as lust, greed, anger and envy, are abudha-liìga-bhäväù, symptoms of ignorance. Indeed, as indicated by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé in his commentary, the manifestation of the modes of nature is synonymous with the manifestation of a particular material body. It is clearly explained throughout the Vedic literature that the conditioned soul receives a particular body, gives it up and then accepts another simply because of his involvement with the modes of nature (käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya [Bg. 13.22]). Thus to say that one is participating in the modes of nature is to say that one is accepting particular types of bodies suitable for the particular material qualities one is involved with.
An ignorant bystander might have simplistically interpreted Kåñëa's pastime of lifting Govardhana Hill as follows: The residents of Våndävana were obliged by Vedic principles to make certain offerings to the god of heaven, Indra. Child Kåñëa, ignoring the position of Indra, usurped these offerings and took them for His own pleasure. When Indra tried to punish Kåñëa and His associates, the Lord frustrated Indra's attempt, humiliated him, and exhausted his pride and resources.
But this superficial interpretation is refuted in this verse. Here Lord Indra addresses Çré Kåñëa as bhagavän, indicating that He is not an ordinary child but in fact God. Therefore Kåñëa's punishing Indra was part of His mission of protecting religious principles and curbing down the envious; it was not a display of material anger or of greed for the offerings meant for Indra. Çré Kåñëa is pure spiritual existence, and His simple, sublime desire is to engage all living beings in the perfect, blissful life of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa's desire to make us Kåñëa conscious is not egotistical, since ultimately Kåñëa is everything and Kåñëa consciousness is objectively the best consciousness. Lord Indra is really the humble servant of Kåñëa, a fact he is now beginning to remember.

You are the father and spiritual master of this entire universe, and also its supreme controller. You are insurmountable time, imposing punishment upon the sinful for their own benefit. Indeed, in Your various incarnations, selected by Your own free will, You act decisively to remove the false pride of those who presume themselves masters of this world.
The word hitäya is significant here. Lord Kåñëa protects religion and chastises the wicked for the benefit of the entire universe. Foolish and faithless pseudopriests criticize God for punishing the living entities through the actions of nature. But whether Lord Kåñëa punishes them indirectly through nature or directly in His incarnations, as mentioned here, He has a perfect right to do so because He is the father, spiritual master and supreme ruler of the entire universe. Another way He curbs down the false attempts of the conditioned souls to establish the kingdom of God without God is through His feature as insurmountable time. It is said, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." That is a fact, and it is actually the Lord's mercy that He takes the trouble to rectify our misbehavior, although faithless persons criticize the Lord's fatherly vigilance.

Even fools like me, who proudly think themselves universal lords, quickly give up their conceit and directly take to the path of the spiritually progressive when they see You are fearless even in the face of time. Thus You punish the mischievous only to instruct them.
History is filled with examples of the supreme authority breaking the conceit of foolish men. Modern world leaders proudly fight one another, placing the common people in unprecedented jeopardy. Similarly Indra, proud of his apparently illustrious position, dared to threaten the lives of the innocent residents of Våndävana with terrible weapons, until his arrogance was curbed by the dynamic response of the Supreme Lord.
Nowadays, governments in the Western countries tend to be elected democratically, and thus the mass of people become identified with the destiny of their leaders. When the proud leaders engage in violence, the people who elected them bear the brunt of such belligerent decisions. Thus the people in the democratic nations of the world should elect Kåñëa conscious leaders, who will establish an administration consonant with the laws of God. If they fail to do so, their materialistic leaders, oblivious of the will of the Supreme Lord, will undoubtedly be chastised by cataclysmic events, and the people who elected such leaders, being responsible for their leaders' acts, will share in the suffering.
It is ironic that in modern democracies not only do the leaders consider themselves universal controllers, but the mass of people, considering the leaders merely their representatives rather than the representatives of God, also consider themselves, as a people, to be the controllers of their nation. Thus the chastisement mentioned in this verse has become unprecedentedly applicable to people in general in the modern world.
Modern man should not simply make himself a lesson of nature by falling down from his proud position; rather he should submissively execute the will of the all-attractive Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, and usher in a new era of sanity, tranquillity and widespread enlightenment.

Engrossed in pride over my ruling power, ignorant of Your majesty, I offended You. O Lord, may You forgive me. My intelligence was bewildered, but let my consciousness never again be so impure.
Although Lord Kåñëa protected the residents of Vraja by lifting Govardhana Hill, He had not yet punished Indra himself, and Indra feared that at any moment Çré Kåñëa might call the son of Vivasvän, Yamaräja, who punishes impudent persons who defy the laws of God.
Indra was quite fearful and thus begged the Lord's forgiveness on the plea that he could be purified only by Kåñëa's mercy—that he was too stubborn to learn a good lesson through mere punishment.
In fact, despite Indra's humility in this case, his heart was not completely purified. Later on in this canto we find that when Lord Kåñëa once took a pärijäta flower from Indra's kingdom, poor Indra again reacted violently against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, we should aspire to go back to our eternal home in the kingdom of Kåñëa, and should not become entangled in the imperfect life of the material gods.

You descend into this world, O transcendent Lord, to destroy the warlords who burden the earth and create many terrible disturbances. O Lord, you simultaneously act for the welfare of those who faithfully serve Your lotus feet.
This verse utilizes an attractive poetic device. Lord Kåñëa's descent into the world is said to be for the abhava, literally "nonexistence" or "destruction," of the demoniac warlords, and simultaneously for the bhava, or "existence, prosperity," of those who faithfully serve the Lord's lotus feet.
True existence, indicated here by the word bhava, is sac-cid-änanda, eternal and full of bliss and knowledge. To an uninformed observer, it may appear that Çré Kåñëa is simply rewarding His followers and punishing His enemies the way any ordinary person might do. This specific doubt about the Lord is raised extensively in the Sixth Canto in connection with Kåñëa's taking the side of the faithful demigods against the faithless demons in a particular cosmic war. In that canto the Vaiñëava authorities clearly explain that in fact Lord Kåñëa is the father and Lord of all living beings and that all His activities are therefore meant for the benefit of all existence. Lord Kåñëa does not really cause the nonexistence of anyone; rather He curbs the foolish, destructive, material ways of those who defy the laws of God. These laws are created to ensure the prosperity, harmony and happiness of the entire creation, and their violation is an unjustifiable disturbance.
Certainly Indra hoped that Lord Kåñëa would count him among the devotees and not the demons, although considering Indra's actions one might doubt where his loyalties actually lay. Indra was aware of this possible doubt and thus, as we find in the next verse, he tried his best to surrender to the Supreme Lord.

sva—of His own (devotees); chanda—according to the desire; upätta—who assumes; dehäya—His transcendental bodies; viçuddha—perfectly pure; jïäna—knowledge; mürtaye—whose form; sarvasmai—to Him who is everything; sarva-béjäya—who is the seed of all; sarva-bhüta—of all created beings; ätmane—who is the indwelling Soul; namaù—obeisances.
Unto Him who assumes transcendental bodies according to the desires of His devotees, unto Him whose form is itself pure consciousness, unto Him who is everything, who is the seed of everything and who is the Soul of all creatures, I offer my obeisances.
We could hardly construe from the first line of this verse that God is somehow impersonal but assumes a personal material body. It is clearly said here that the Lord assumes different forms according to svacchanda—according to His own desire or according to the desires of His devotees. An impersonal God could hardly reciprocate with the personal desires of Its devotees, nor could an impersonal God Itself have desires, since desire is characteristic of personality. Therefore, the Lord's manifesting different forms in a personal way, responding to personal desires, indicates that He is eternally a person and manifests His different transcendental bodies as an expression of His own eternal nature.
The word viçuddha-jïäna-mürtaye is most significant. Mürti means the form of the Deity, and it is specifically stated here that the Lord's form is itself completely pure consciousness. Consciousness is the primary spiritual element, distinct from any of the material elements, and even distinct from the subtle or psychological material elements—mundane mind, intelligence and false ego—which are simply a psychic covering over pure consciousness. Since the Lord's form is made of pure consciousness, it can hardly be understood as a material body like the mortal bags of flesh and bones we carry around in this world.
In the last two lines of this verse, there is poetic emphasis on the word sarva, "everything." The Lord is everything: He is the seed of everything and He is the Soul of every creature. Therefore, let us join with Indra in offering our obeisances to the Lord.

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out here that mother Surabhi is feeling great ecstasy as she repeats the words "Kåñëa, Kåñëa." Kåñëa lifted Govardhana Hill by His mystic power and thus protected the cows of Våndävana, whereas her so-called master, Indra, had tried to kill them. Thus Surabhi now clearly understands that it is not the demigods but rather the Supreme God, Kåñëa Himself, who is her real master forever.

The Supreme Lord is self-sufficient: He can do everything Himself. The Lord appointed one of His innumerable children to the position of Indra, the lord of the cosmic heaven. But Indra abused his authority, and now Surabhi requests Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, to directly become her Lord, her Indra. We should carefully perform our duties without false pride; thus we will not become obsolete and embarrassed, as in the present case of King Indra, who actually attacked Lord Kåñëa and His Våndävana devotees.

As ordered by Lord Brahmä, we shall perform Your bathing ceremony to coronate You as Indra. O Soul of the universe, You descend to this world to relieve the burden of the earth.
Surabhi makes it quite clear in this verse that she has had enough of the leadership of imperfect demigods like Purandara (Indra), and now she is determined to directly serve the Supreme Lord. Since Brahmä has ordered her, her attempt to coronate Lord Kåñëa as her personal Lord is authorized by higher authority. Moreover, Lord Kåñëa Himself comes down to the earth to relieve the burden of self-destructive, mundane administration, and thus it is perfectly consistent with the Lord's own purpose that He become the Lord of Surabhi. Since the Lord rules millions of universes, He can certainly take care of mother Surabhi.
In fact, Surabhi wanted to bathe the Lord for her own purification, and she earnestly makes her proposal to Viçvätmä, the Soul of the universe, Çré Kåñëa.

Varuëa ecstatically exclaims here that since he has now seen the infinitely gorgeous body of Lord Kåñëa, the trouble of assuming a material body has now been supremely justified. Indeed, the artha, the goal or real value of Varuëa's life, has now been achieved. Because Lord Kåñëa's form is transcendental, those who accept His lotus feet go beyond the boundary of material existence, and thus only the spiritually unaware would presume that the Lord's lotus feet are material.

The word çrüyate is significant here. Çruti, or Vedic literature, consists of authorized statements made by the Lord Himself or His enlightened representatives. Thus neither the Lord nor recognized spiritual authorities would ever say that within the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, there is the fault of illusion. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that the word brahmaëe here indicates the Lord is full in Himself, and that the term paramätmane indicates He is the controller of all living entities.
Thus within the supreme being, complete in Himself and omnipotent, we do not find any jurisdiction of the material, illusory energy.

Your father, who is sitting here, was brought to me by a foolish, ignorant servant of mine who did not understand his proper duty. Therefore, please forgive us.
The word ayam, "this one here," clearly indicates that Kåñëa's father, Nanda Mahäräja, was present as Varuëa was speaking. In fact, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states that Varuëa had seated Çré Nanda on a jeweled throne and had personally worshiped him out of respect.
Technically, Nanda Mahäräja was correct in entering the water just before sunrise. The following explanation is given by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary on the first verse of this chapter: After an especially short Ekädaçé, measuring only eighteen hours, about six hours of the lunar day in which the fast had to be broken, namely the Dvädaçé, had already expired before the dawn. Since at sunrise the proper time for breaking the fast would have passed, Nanda Mahäräja decided to enter the water at an otherwise inauspicious time.
Of course, Varuëa's servant should have been aware of these technical details, which are meant for strict followers of the Vedic rituals. Above and beyond that, Nanda Mahäräja was acting as the Supreme Lord's father and was therefore a most sacred person, beyond the touch of insignificant cosmic bureaucrats like the foolish servant of Varuëa.

yat—which; pati—of husbands; apatya—children; suhådäm—and well-wishing relatives and friends; anuvåttiù—the following; aìga—our dear Kåñëa; stréëäm—of women; sva-dharmaù—the proper religious duty; iti—thus; dharma-vidä—by the knower of religion; tvayä—You; uktam—spoken; astu—let it be; evam—like that; etat—this; upadeça—of this instruction; pade—to the real object; tvayi—You; éçe—O Lord; preñöhaù—the dearmost; bhavän—You; tanu-bhåtäm—for all embodied living beings; kila—certainly; bandhuù—the close relative; ätmä—the very Self.
Our dear Kåñëa, as an expert in religion You have advised us that the proper religious duty for women is to faithfully serve their husbands, children and other relatives. We agree that this principle is valid, but actually this service should be rendered to You. After all, O Lord, You are the dearmost friend of all embodied souls. You are their most intimate relative and indeed their very Self.
Çré Kåñëa is the Soul of all souls, their dearmost friend and well-wisher. As stated in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhägavatam (11.5.41):
devarñi-bhütäpta-nåëäà pitèëäà
na kiìkaro näyam åëé ca räjan
sarvätmanä yaù çaraëaà çaraëyaà
gato mukundaà parihåtya kartam
"O King, one who has given up all material duties and has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who offers shelter to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one's forefathers who have passed away. Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord's service has no need to serve such persons separately." Authority descends from the author of all existence, the Supreme Lord. Natural figures of authority such as husbands, mothers, government leaders and sages gain their power and authority from the Supreme Lord and should thus represent the Absolute Truth to those who follow them. If one wholeheartedly engages in loving service to the original, Supreme Truth, one need not indirectly serve the Absolute Truth through the above-mentioned secondary authorities.
Even a soul surrendered to God, however, continues to serve the spiritual master, who is a direct, not an indirect, representative of the Supreme Lord. A bona fide äcärya, or spiritual master, is the transparent medium leading the disciple to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. All indirect authorities become obsolete when one is directly in touch with the Absolute Truth. The gopés wanted to explain this basic point to Kåñëa, and some of the bolder young girls among them attempted to defeat Çré Kåñëa with His own statements, as exemplified in this verse.

Until today our minds were absorbed in household affairs, but You easily stole both our minds and our hands away from our housework. Now our feet won't move one step from Your lotus feet. How can we go back to Vraja? What would we do there?
Çré Kåñëa had blown into His flute, and the intoxicating music that had come out of its holes had stolen the minds of the young gopé girls. Now they had come to see Kåñëa to demand back their stolen property, but they could regain their minds only if Çré Kåñëa accepted them and engaged with them in conjugal affairs.
Çré Kåñëa might have replied, "But My dear gopés, just go home for now. Let Me consider the situation for a day or two, and then I will give you back your minds." In reply to this possible argument, the gopés state, "Our feet refuse to move even one step. So please give us back our minds and accept us, and then we will go."

çréù—the goddess of fortune, wife of Lord Näräyaëa; yat—as; pada-ambuja—of the lotus feet; rajaù—the dust; cakame—desired; tulasyä—together with Tulasé-devé; labdhvä—having obtained; api—even; vakñasi—upon His chest; padam—her position; kila—indeed; bhåtya—by servants; juñöam—served; yasyäù—whose (Lakñmé's); sva—upon themselves; vékñaëe—for the sake of the glance; uta—on the other hand; anya—of the other; sura—demigods; prayäsaù—the endeavor; tadvat—in the same way; vayam—we; ca—also; tava—Your; päda—of the feet; rajaù—the dust; prapannäù—have approached for shelter.
Goddess Lakñmé, whose glance is sought after by the demigods with great endeavor, has achieved the unique position of always remaining on the chest of her Lord, Näräyaëa. Still, she desires the dust of His lotus feet, even though she has to share that dust with Tulasé-devé and indeed with the Lord's many other servants. Similarly, we have approached the dust of Your lotus feet for shelter.
The gopés here point out that the dust of the Lord's feet is so ecstatic and enlivening that the goddess of fortune wants to abandon her unique position on His chest to share with many other devotees a position at His feet. Thus the gopés urge Lord Kåñëa not to be guilty of a double standard. Since the Lord gave the goddess of fortune a place on His chest and also allowed her to seek the dust of His lotus feet, Kåñëa should certainly give the same opportunity to His most loving devotees, the gopés. "After all," the gopés plead, "seeking the dust of Your lotus feet is perfectly justified, and You should encourage us in this endeavor and not try to send us away."

Therefore, O vanquisher of all distress, please show us mercy. To approach Your lotus feet we abandoned our families and homes, and we have no desire other than to serve You. Our hearts are burning with intense desires generated by Your beautiful smiling glances. O jewel among men, please make us Your maidservants.
When Çré Kåñëa was born, the sage Garga predicted that He would manifest all the opulences of the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa. The gopés now appeal to the Lord to fulfill this prediction by being merciful and granting them direct service, just as Lord Näräyaëa awards direct service to His loving devotees. The gopés emphasize that they did not give up their families and homes with the hope of securing a higher pleasure from Kåñëa. They are simply begging for service, revealing their pure-hearted devotion. The gopés think, "If in the course of Your pursuing Your happiness we somehow or other become happy by seeing Your face, what is the harm in that?"
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments on the words puruña-bhüñaëa, "O jewel among men." The Öhäkura states that the gopés meant to say, "O jewel of all males, please decorate our golden bodies with the dark blue gems of Your limbs."

Seeing Your face encircled by curling locks of hair, Your cheeks beautified by earrings, Your lips full of nectar, and Your smiling glance, and also seeing Your two imposing arms, which take away our fear, and Your chest, which is the only source of pleasure for the goddess of fortune, we must become Your maidservants.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura envisions the gopés' dealings with Kåñëa as follows:
"Kåñëa says, 'You want to become My servants; so do I have to buy you with some payment, or are you giving yourselves freely?'
"The gopés reply, 'Since the beginning of our youthful womanhood You have been purchasing us with a payment millions and millions of times more than enough. That payment is Your gemlike smiling glance, which constitutes a great treasure we have never heard about or seen anywhere else.'
" 'When You put Your golden turban on Your head, Your maidservant will act as Your valet, pulling up the turban bit by bit until it is in just the right position. And even while You shake a chastising finger at her, trying hard to prohibit her, she will put her hand beneath Your turban and take the opportunity to glance at Your face. Thus we, Your maidservants, will relish with our eyes Your abundant sweetness.'
"Kåñëa says, 'Your husbands will not tolerate this behavior of ours. They will complain bitterly to King Kaàsa, thus producing a fearful situation for Me and for you as well.'
"The gopés say, 'But Kåñëa, Your two mighty arms make us fearless, just as they did when You held up Govardhana Hill to protect us from the pride of Mahendra. Those arms will certainly kill that beast Kaàsa.'
" 'But being a religious person, I cannot make others' wives My maidservants. '
" 'O dear crest jewel of religious personalities, You may say that You refuse to make the cowherds' wives Your maidservants, but by force You have already taken Lakñmé, the wife of Näräyaëa, from Vaikuëöha and are carrying her around on Your chest. Out of shame she has assumed the form of a golden line on Your chest, and she takes her only pleasure there.
" 'Besides, within all the fourteen worlds and even above these worlds—in Vaikuëöhaloka, beyond this universe—You never reject any beautiful woman, no matter who she is or whom she belongs to. We know this quite well.' "

Dear Kåñëa, what woman in all the three worlds wouldn't deviate from religious behavior when bewildered by the sweet, drawn-out melody of Your flute? Your beauty makes all three worlds auspicious. Indeed, even the cows, birds, trees and deer manifest the ecstatic symptom of bodily hair standing on end when they see Your beautiful form.

Your lotus feet destroy the past sins of all embodied souls who surrender to them. Those feet follow after the cows in the pastures and are the eternal abode of the goddess of fortune. Since You once put those feet on the hoods of the great serpent Käliya, please place them upon our breasts and tear away the lust in our hearts.
In their appeal, the gopés point out that Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet destroy the sins of all surrendered conditioned souls. The Lord is so merciful that He even goes out to herd the cows in the pasturing ground, and thus His lotus feet follow them about in the grass. He has offered His lotus feet to the goddess of fortune and has placed them upon the hoods of the serpent Käliya. Therefore, considering all this, the Lord should place His lotus feet on the gopés' breasts and satisfy their desire. That is the logic the gopés employ here.

King Pratäparudra recited this verse to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu during Lord Jagannätha's Ratha-yäträ festival. While the Lord was resting in a garden, King Pratäparudra humbly entered and began massaging His legs and lotus feet. Then the king recited the Thirty-first Chapter of the Tenth Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the songs of the gopés. The Caitanya-caritämåta relates that when Lord Caitanya heard this verse, beginning tava kathämåtam, He immediately arose in ecstatic love and embraced King Pratäparudra. The incident is described in detail in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 14.4-18), and in his edition Çréla Prabhupäda has given extensive commentary on it.

O hero, kindly distribute to us the nectar of Your lips, which enhances conjugal pleasure and vanquishes grief. That nectar is thoroughly relished by Your vibrating flute and makes people forget any other attachment.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté' s charming commentary on this verse is in the form of a dialogue between the gopés and Kåñëa:
"The gopés say, 'O Kåñëa, You exactly resemble Dhanvantari, the best of physicians. So please give us some medicine, for we are suffering from the disease of romantic desire for You. Don't hesitate to give us the medicinal nectar of Your lips freely, without our paying a substantial price. Since You are a great hero in giving charity, You should give it without any payment, even to the most wretched persons. Consider that we are losing our life and that now You can restore us to life by giving us that nectar. After all, You have already given it to Your flute, which is simply a hollow bamboo stick.'
"Kåñëa says, 'But the diet of people in this world is the bad one of attachment to wealth, followers, family and so forth. The particular medicine you've requested should not be given to those who have such a bad diet.'
" 'But this medicine makes one forget all other attachments. So wonderful is this herbal drug that it counteracts bad dietary habits. Please give that nectar to us, O hero, since You are most charitable.' "

According to the äcäryas, the gopés repeatedly entreat Lord Kåñëa to place His lotus feet on their breasts. The gopés are not victims of material lust, but rather they are absorbed in pure love of Godhead and thus want to serve Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet by offering their beautiful breasts to Him. Materialistic persons, who are victims of mundane sex desire, will not be able to understand how these conjugal dealings take place on a pure, spiritual platform, and that is the materialists' great misfortune.

At that time the demigoddesses traveling in the sky with their husbands, the Siddhas, become amazed. As those ladies listen, they are embarrassed to find their minds yielding to the pursuit of lusty desires, and in their distress they are unaware that the belts of their garments are loosening.

O girls! This son of Nanda, who gives joy to the distressed, bears steady lightning on His chest and has a smile like a jeweled necklace. Now please hear something wonderful. When He vibrates His flute, Vraja's bulls, deer and cows, standing in groups at a great distance, are all captivated by the sound, and they stop chewing the food in their mouths and cock their ears. Stunned, they appear as if asleep, or like figures in a painting.
The word sthira-vidyut, "steady lightning," refers to the goddess of fortune, who resides on the chest of the Supreme Lord. When the animals of Våndävana hear the sound of the flute, they become stunned in ecstasy, and thus they stop chewing their food and cannot swallow it. The gopés, in separation from Kåñëa, marvel at the extraordinary effect of the Lord's flute-playing.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé gives the following explanation of the compound word hära-häsa, which compares Lord Kåñëa's smile to a necklace: "The word can mean 'He whose smile is brilliantly clear like a jeweled necklace' or 'He whose smile is reflected from His jeweled necklaces,' because while Kåñëa plays the flute He bends His head down and smiles. The word can also mean 'He whose smile, like a jeweled necklace, casts its effulgence upon His chest' or 'He whose necklaces shine brilliantly, just like a smile.' "

My dear gopé, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balaräma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.
The gopés state here that the sound of Kåñëa's flute causes even inanimate objects like rivers to become conscious and then stunned in ecstasy. Just as the gopés could not always be in Kåñëa's physical association, the rivers could not come to the Lord's lotus feet. Although they desired the Lord, their movement was checked by ecstasy, and their "arms," their waves, trembled with love of Godhead.

Kåñëa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kåñëa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viñëu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.
Maddened by the divine, honeylike aroma of the tulasé flowers on the garland Kåñëa wears, swarms of bees sing loudly for Him, and that most beautiful of all persons thankfully acknowledges and acclaims their song by taking His flute to His lips and playing it. The charming flute song then steals away the minds of the cranes, swans and other lake-dwelling birds. Indeed, they approach Kåñëa, close their eyes and, maintaining strict silence, worship Him by fixing their consciousness upon Him in deep meditation.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has made several illuminating comments on these verses. He gives the analogy that just as when householder Vaiñëavas hear a saìkértana party approaching they become ecstatic and offer obeisances, so the trees and creepers in Våndävana became ecstatic when they heard Kåñëa's flute and bowed low with their branches and vines. The word darçanéya-tilaka in Text 10 indicates not only that the Lord is "the most excellent (to see)," but also that He decorated Himself with attractive reddish tilaka taken from the mineral-rich earth of Våndävana forest.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also points out that tulasé, although exalted in many ways, is not normally considered an especially fragrant plant. However, early in the morning tulasé emits a transcendental fragrance that ordinary people cannot perceive but that transcendental personalities fully appreciate. The bees who are privileged to swarm about the flower garlands worn by the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly appreciate this fragrance, and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Bhägavatam (3.15.19) to the effect that the most fragrant plants in Vaikuëöha also appreciate the special qualifications of Tulasé-devé.
The word sandhita-veëuù in Text 10 indicates that Lord Kåñëa placed His flute firmly upon His lips. And the melody emanating from that flute is certainly the most enchanting of sounds, as the gopés describe in this chapter.

O goddesses of Vraja, when Kåñëa is enjoying Himself with Balaräma on the mountain slopes, playfully wearing a flower garland on the top of His head, He engladdens all with the resonant vibrations of His flute. Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend Kåñëa and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.

O pious Mother Yaçodä, your son, who is expert in all the arts of herding cows, has invented many new styles of flute-playing. When He takes His flute to His bimba-red lips and sends forth the tones of the harmonic scale in variegated melodies, Brahmä, Çiva, Indra and other chief demigods become confused upon hearing the sound. Although they are the most learned authorities, they cannot ascertain the essence of that music, and thus they bow down their heads and hearts.
The words tava sutaù sati, "your son, O chaste lady," clearly indicate that at this point Mother Yaçodä is among the young gopés as they earnestly describe Lord Kåñëa's glories. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, among the demigods led by Çakra (Lord Indra) were Upendra, Agni and Yamaräja, among those led by Çarva (Lord Çiva) were Kätyäyané, Skanda and Gaëeça, and among those led by Parameñöhé (Lord Brahmä) were the four Kumäras and Närada. Thus the best collective intelligence in the universe could not definitively analyze the enchanting musical arrangements of the Supreme Lord.

As Kåñëa strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gopés, who become agitated by Cupid when Kåñëa playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.
Here Mother Yaçodä is no longer in the company of the gopés, who are confidentially describing their conjugal attraction to Çré Kåñëa. It is clear from the comments of Jéva Gosvämé and other äcäryas that the statements in this chapter were made at various times and places. This is natural, since the gopés were always absorbed in thoughts of Çré Kåñëa, day and night.

Now Kåñëa is standing somewhere counting His cows on a string of gems. He wears a garland of tulasé flowers that bear the fragrance of His beloved, and He has thrown His arm over the shoulder of an affectionate cowherd boyfriend. As Kåñëa plays His flute and sings, the music attracts the black deer's wives, who approach that ocean of transcendental qualities and sit down beside Him. Just like us cowherd girls, they have given up all hope for happiness in family life.
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that in the afternoon Çré Kåñëa dressed Himself in a different outfit and then went out to call the cows home. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté gives the following information about the transcendental cows of Våndävana: "For each of the four colors of cows—white, red, black and yellow—there are twenty-five subdivisions, making a total of one hundred colors. And such qualities as being colored like sandalwood-pulp tilaka [speckled] or having a head shaped like a mådaìga drum create eight further groups. To count these 108 groups of cows, distinguished by color and form, Kåñëa is using a string of 108 jewel-beads....
"Thus when Kåñëa calls out 'Hey Dhavalé [the name of a white cow],' a whole group of white cows come forward, and when He calls 'Haàsé, Candané, Gaìgä, Muktä' and so on, the twenty-four other groups of white cows come. The reddish cows are called Aruëé, Kuìkuma, Sarasvaté, etc., the blackish ones Çyämalä, Dhümalä, Yamunä, etc., and the yellowish ones Pétä, Piìgalä, Haritälikä, etc. Those in the group with tilaka marks on their foreheads are called Citritä, Citra-tilakä, Dérgha-tilakä and Tiryak-tilakä, and there are groups known as Mådaìga-mukhé [mådaìga-head], Siàha-mukhé [lion-head] and so on.
"Thus being called by name, the cows are coming forward, and Kåñëa, thinking that when it is time to bring them back from the forest none should be forgotten, is counting them on His jewel-beads."

O sinless Yaçodä, your darling child, the son of Mahäräja Nanda, has festively enhanced His attire with a jasmine garland, and He is now playing along the Yamunä in the company of the cows and cowherd boys, amusing His dear companions. The gentle breeze honors Him with its soothing fragrance of sandalwood, while the various Upadevas, standing on all sides like panegyrists, offer their music, singing and gifts of tribute.
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the gopés are again in the courtyard of Mother Yaçodä, the queen of Vraja. They are trying to encourage her by describing Kåñëa's return to Våndävana after He has spent the day herding cows and playing.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments that the Upadevas, the minor demigods mentioned here, include the Gandharvas, who are famous for their celestial music and dancing.

Out of great affection for the cows of Vraja, Kåñëa became the lifter of Govardhana Hill. At the end of the day, having rounded up all His own cows, He plays a song on His flute, while exalted demigods standing along the path worship His lotus feet and the cowherd boys accompanying Him chant His glories. His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Kåñëa is the moon arisen from the womb of Mother Yaçodä.
According to the äcäryas, at this point the gopés climbed into the watchtowers of Våndävana's houses so they could see Kåñëa as soon as possible when He returned home. Mother Yaçodä was very anxious for her son to come back, and therefore she had the tallest of the beautiful young gopés climb up to see when He would arrive. It is implied here that Kåñëa was somewhat delayed on the way home because His lotus feet were being worshiped by great demigods along the path.

As Kåñëa respectfully greets His well-wishing friends, His eyes roll slightly as if from intoxication. He wears a flower garland, and the beauty of His soft cheeks is accentuated by the brilliance of His golden earrings and the whiteness of His face, which has the color of a badara berry. With His cheerful face resembling the moon, lord of the night, the Lord of the Yadus moves with the grace of a regal elephant. Thus He returns in the evening, delivering the cows of Vraja from the heat of the day.
The word gaväm is constructed from the Sanskrit word go, which means "cow" or "senses." Thus Çré Kåñëa, by coming back to the village of Vraja, relieved the inhabitants of Våndävana from the distress their eyes and other senses felt during the day because of being separated from direct contact with Him.

Then I will see You kill Kälayavana, Mura, Naraka and the conch demon, and I will also see You steal the pärijäta flower and defeat Indra. I will then see You marry many daughters of heroic kings after paying for them with Your valor. Then, O Lord of the universe, in Dvärakä You will deliver King Någa from a curse and take for Yourself the Syamantaka jewel, together with another wife. You will bring back a brähmaëa's dead son from the abode of Your servant Yamaräja, and thereafter You will kill Pauëòraka, burn down the city of Käçé and slay Dantavakra, and You will also put an end to the king of Cedi during the great Räjasüya sacrifice. I shall see all these heroic pastimes, along with many others You will perform during Your residence in Dvärakä. These pastimes are glorified on this earth in the songs of transcendental poets.

The gopés did not care to see anything but Kåñëa; therefore if Kåñëa left Våndävana, their eyes would have no function. Thus Kåñëa's departure was blinding these poor girls, and in their distress they berated Akrüra, whose name means "not cruel," as cruel indeed.

They are helping Kåñëa go to Mathurä, but they will have to come back to Våndävana and will certainly die in His absence. The whole world has become nonsensical."

Let us directly approach Mädhava and stop Him from going. What can our family elders and other relatives do to us? Now that fate is separating us from Mukunda, our hearts are already wretched, for we cannot bear to give up His association even for a fraction of a second.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté describes what the gopés thought: "Let us go right up to Kåñëa and pull at His clothes and hands and insist that He get down from His chariot and stay here with us. We will tell Him, 'Don't bring upon Yourself the sinful reaction for murdering so many women!' "
"But if we do that," said other gopés, "our relatives and the village elders will discover our secret love for Kåñëa and abandon us."
"But what can they do to us?"
"Yes, our lives are already wretched now that Kåñëa is leaving. We have nothing to lose."
"That's right. We will remain in the Våndävana forest just like presiding goddesses, and then we can fulfill our true desire—to stay with Kåñëa in the forest."
"Yes, and even if the elders and our relatives punish us by beating us or locking us up, we can still live happily with the knowledge that Kåñëa is residing in our village. Some of our girlfriends who are not imprisoned will cleverly find a way to bring us the remnants of Kåñëa's food, and then we can remain alive. But if Kåñëa is not stopped, we will certainly die."

For the gopés, a long time in Kåñëa's association passed like a moment, and a single moment in His absence seemed like a very long time.

Earth; water; fire; air; ether and its source, false ego; the mahat-tattva; the total material nature and her source, the Supreme Lord's puruña expansion; the mind; the senses; the sense objects; and the senses' presiding deities—all these causes of the cosmic manifestation are born from Your transcendental body.

na—do not; ete—these (elements of creation); svarüpam—the true identity; viduù—know; ätmanaù—of the Supreme Soul; te—You; hi—indeed; ajä-ädayaù—headed by the total material nature; anätmatayä—by the status of being nonliving matter; gåhétäù—seized; ajaù—Lord Brahmä; anubaddhaù—bound up; saù—he; guëaiù—by the modes; ajäyäù—of material nature; guëät—to these modes; param—transcendental; veda na—he does not know; te—Your; svarüpam—true form.
The total material nature and these other elements of creation certainly cannot know You as You are, for they are manifested in the realm of dull matter. Since You are beyond the modes of nature, even Lord Brahma, who is bound up in these modes, does not know Your true identity.
God is transcendental to material nature. Unless we also transcend the limited consciousness of material existence, we cannot know Him. Even the greatest living entity in the universe, Brahmä, cannot understand the Supreme unless he comes to the platform of pure Kåñëa consciousness.

Brähmaëas who follow the regulations concerning the three sacred fires worship You by chanting mantras from the three Vedas and performing elaborate fire sacrifices for the various demigods, who have many forms and names.
Akrüra has now described how those who follow the paths of Säìkhya, yoga and the three Vedas worship the Supreme Lord in different ways. In the various places where the Vedas appear to recommend that one worship Indra, Varuëa and other demigods, these demigods are stated to be supreme. But at the same time the Vedas state that there is one supreme controller, the Absolute Truth. That is Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, who expands His potency through material creation into the forms of the demigods. Thus worship of the demigods goes to Him through the indirect method of karma-käëòa, or fruitive religious rituals. Ultimately, however, one who wants to achieve eternal perfection should worship the Lord directly, in full Kåñëa consciousness.

In pursuit of spiritual knowledge, some persons renounce all material activities and, having thus become peaceful, perform the sacrifice of philosophic investigation to worship You, the original form of all knowledge.
Modern philosophers pursue knowledge without bothering to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus they naturally end up with meager, if not trivial, results.

anye—others; ca—and; saàskåta—purified; ätmänaù—whose intelligence; vidhinä—by the injunctions (of such scriptures as the Païcarätra); abhihitena—presented; te—by You; yajanti—worship; tvat-mayäù—filled with thought of You; tväm—You; vai—indeed; bahu-mürti—having many forms; eka-mürtikam—having one form.
And yet others—those whose intelligence is pure—follow the injunctions of Vaiñëava scriptures promulgated by You. Absorbing their minds in thought of You, they worship You as the one Supreme Lord manifesting in multiple forms.
The word saàskåtätmänaù, "they whose intelligence is pure," is significant here. It implies that the worshipers mentioned before have not completely purified their intelligence of material contamination and thus worship the Lord indirectly. Those who are purified, however, directly worship the Lord, either as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, or as one of His various plenary forms, such as Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna or Aniruddha, as indicated here.

There are still others, who worship You, the Supreme Lord, in the form of Lord Çiva. They follow the path described by him and interpreted in various ways by many teachers.
The words tväm eva, "You also," indicate that the path of worshiping Lord Çiva is indirect and therefore inferior. Akrüra himself is following the superior method by directly worshiping Kåñëa, or Viñëu, with his prayers.

But all these people, my Lord, even those who have turned their attention away from You and are worshiping other deities, are actually worshiping You alone, O embodiment of all the demigods.
The idea here is that even those who worship the demigods are indirectly worshiping the Supreme Lord Viñëu. The understanding of such worshipers, however, is imperfect.

As rivers born from the mountains and filled by the rain flow from all sides into the sea, so do all these paths in the end reach You, O master.
Lord Kåñëa Himself speaks on this issue of worship in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.23-25):

 [Bg. 9.25]
"Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunté, but they do so in a wrong way. I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices. Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down. Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me."

The gopé said: O honeybee, O friend of a cheater, don't touch My feet with your whiskers, which are smeared with the kuìkuma that rubbed onto Kåñëa's garland when it was crushed by the breasts of a rival lover! Let Kåñëa satisfy the women of Mathurä. One who sends a messenger like you will certainly be ridiculed in the Yadus' assembly.
Çrématé Rädhäräëé indirectly chastised Kåñëa by chastising the bumblebee, which She took for His messenger. She addressed the bumblebee as madhupa, "one who drinks the nectar (of flowers)," and She addressed Kåñëa as madhu-pati, "the Lord of Madhu."
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that this and the following nine verses exemplify ten kinds of impulsive speech spoken by a lover. This verse illustrates the qualities of prajalpa, as described by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in the following verse from his Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.182):
asüyerñyä-mada-yujä
yo 'vadhéraëa-mudrayä
priyasyäkauçalodgäraù
prajalpaù sa tu kértyate
"Prajalpa is speech that denigrates the tactlessness of one's lover with expressions of disrespect. It is spoken in a mood of envy, jealousy and pride." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that the word kitava-bandho expresses envy; the phrase from sapatnyäù to naù, jealousy; the phrase mä spåça aìghrim, pride; and the phrase from vahatu to prasädam, disrespect, while the phrase from yadu-sadasi to the end of the verse decries Kåñëa's tactless treatment of Rädhäräëé.

After making us drink the enchanting nectar of His lips only once, Kåñëa suddenly abandoned us, just as you might quickly abandon some flowers. How is it, then, that Goddess Padmä willingly serves His lotus feet? Alas! The answer must certainly be that her mind has been stolen away by His deceitful words.
In this verse Çrématé Rädhäräëé continues to compare Çré Kåñëa to the bumblebee, and in Her distress She states that the reason the goddess of fortune is constantly devoted to His lotus feet must be that she has been fooled by Kåñëa's promises. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, this statement of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's illustrates parijalpa, as described in Çré Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.184):
prabhor nidayatä-çäöhya-

"Parijalpa is that speech which, through various devices, shows one's own cleverness by exposing the mercilessness, duplicity, unreliability and so on of one's Lord."

kim—why; iha—here; bahu—much; ñaö-aìghre—O bee (six-footed one); gäyasi—are singing; tvam—you; yadünäm—of the Yadus; adhipatim—about the master; agåhäëäm—who have no home; agrataù—in front of; naù—us; puräëam—old; vijaya—of Arjuna; sakha—of the friend; sakhénäm—for the friends; géyatäm—should be sung; tat—of Him; prasaìgaù—the topics; kñapita—relieved; kuca—of whose breasts; rujaù—the pain; te—they; kalpayanti—will provide; iñöam—the charity you desire; iñöäù—His beloveds.
O bee, why do you sing here so much about the Lord of the Yadus, in front of us homeless people? These topics are old news to us. Better you sing about that friend of Arjuna in front of His new girlfriends, the burning desire in whose breasts He has now relieved. Those ladies will surely give you the charity you are begging.
With the words agåhäëäm agrato naù, Rädhäräëé laments that even though She and the other gopés gave up their homes to love Kåñëa in a conjugal relationship, the Lord left them and became a prince in the great royal city of the Yadus. Besides meaning "Arjuna, the victor," the word vijaya also directly indicates Çré Kåñëa, who is always victorious in His endeavors, and besides meaning "old (news)," the word puräëam also indicates that Çré Kåñëa is glorified in the ancient Vedic scriptures of that name.
In this verse we observe in Rädhäräëé's mood the seed of jealous anger, which arises from an apparent disdain for Kåñëa, accompanied by a sarcastic sidelong glance directed toward Him. Thus this verse fits the following description of vijalpa from the Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.186):
vyaktayäsüyayä güòha-
mäna-mudräntarälayä
agha-dviñi kaöäkñoktir
vijalpo viduñäà mataù
"According to learned authorities, vijalpa is sarcastic speech that is addressed to the killer of Agha and that openly expresses jealousy while at the same time hinting at one's angry pride."

In heaven, on earth or in the subterranean sphere, what women are unavailable to Him? He simply arches His eyebrows and smiles with deceptive charm, and they all become His. The supreme goddess herself worships the dust of His feet, so what is our position in comparison? But at least those who are wretched can chant His name, Uttamaçloka.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté states that Rädhäräëé's speech, expressing all the feelings of a disappointed lover, indicates an intensity of love for Çré Kåñëa surpassing even that of the goddess of fortune. While all the gopés are perfectly compatible with Çré Kåñëa in terms of their beauty, temperament and so on, Çrématé Rädhäräëé is especially so. In Her forlorn state, Rädhäräëé indicates to Kåñëa, "You are called Uttamaçloka because You are merciful to the wretched and fallen, but if You would be merciful to Me, then You would actually deserve this exalted name."
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further points out that in this verse, Çrématé Rädhäräëé expresses Her spite born of pride, accuses Kåñëa of being a cheater and finds fault with His behavior. Thus this verse contains speech known as ujjalpa, as described in the following verse of the Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.188):
hareù kuhakatäkhyänaà
garva-garbhitayerñyayä
säsüyaç ca tad-äkñepo
dhérair ujjalpa éryate
"The declaration of Lord Hari's duplicitous nature in a mood of spite born of pride, together with jealously spoken insults directed against Him, has been termed ujjalpa by the wise."

According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, this verse illustrates the qualities of saïjalpa, as described by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in the following verse of his Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.190):
solluëöhayä gahanayä
kayäpy äkñepa-mudrayä
tasyäkåta-jïatädy-uktiù
saïjalpaù kathito budhaiù
"The learned describe saïjalpa as that speech which decries with deep irony and insulting gestures the beloved's ungratefulness and so on." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that the word ädi, "and so on," implies the perception in one's lover of hardheartedness, of an inimical attitude and of a complete lack of love.

Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mahäräja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can't give up talking about Him.
In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda explains the meaning of this verse as follows: "[Çrématé Rädhäräëé said to the bee,] 'You poor messenger, you are only a less intelligent servant. You do not know much about Kåñëa—how ungrateful and hardhearted He has been, not only in this life but in His previous lives also. We have heard this from Our grandmother Paurëamäsé. She has informed Us that Kåñëa was born in a kñatriya family previous to this birth and was known as Rämacandra. In that birth, instead of killing Väli, an enemy of His friend, in the manner of a kñatriya, He killed him just like a hunter. A hunter takes a secure hiding place and then kills an animal without facing it. So Lord Rämacandra, as a kñatriya, should have fought with Väli face to face, but instigated by His friend, He killed him from behind a tree. Thus He deviated from the religious principles of a kñatriya. Also, He was so attracted by the beauty of Sétä that He converted Çürpaëakhä, the sister of Rävaëa, into an ugly woman by cutting off her nose and ears. Çürpaëakhä proposed an intimate relationship with Him, and as a kñatriya He should have satisfied her. But He was so henpecked that He could not forget Sétä-devé and converted Çürpaëakhä into an ugly woman. Before that birth as a kñatriya, He took birth as a brähmaëa boy known as Vämanadeva and asked charity from Bali Mahäräja. Bali was so magnanimous that he gave Him whatever he had, yet Kåñëa as Vämanadeva ungratefully arrested him just like a crow and pushed him down to the Pätäla kingdom. We know all about Kåñëa and how ungrateful He is. But here is the difficulty: In spite of His being so cruel and hardhearted, it is very difficult for us to give up talking about Him.' "
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that this speech of Rädhäräëé's is called avajalpa, as described by Rüpa Gosvämé in the following verse from the Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.192):
harau käöhinya-kämitva-
dhaurtyäd äsakty-ayogyatä
yatra serñyä-bhiyevoktä
so 'vajalpaù satäà mataù
"Saintly persons have concluded that when a lover, impelled by jealousy and fear, declares that Lord Hari is unworthy of her attachment because of His harshness, lustiness and dishonesty, such speech is called avajalpa."

To hear about the pastimes that Kåñëa regularly performs is nectar for the ears. For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to Våndävana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.
Material duality is based on falsely thinking, "This is mine, and that is yours," or "This is our country, and that is yours," or "This is my family, and that is yours," and so on. In fact, there is one Absolute Truth, in which we all exist and to whom everything belongs. His beauty and pleasure are also absolute and infinite, and if one actually hears about this Absolute Truth, called Kåñëa, one's dedication to the illusion of mundane duality is spoiled.
According to the äcäryas, and certainly in accord with Sanskrit grammar, the last two words of the second line of this text may also be divided dharma-avinañöäù. Then the entire line becomes part of a single compound, the meaning of which is that hearing about Kåñëa cleanses one of irreligious duality and thus one is not vanquished (avinañöa) by material illusion. The word dénäù is then given the alternate reading of dhéräù, meaning that one becomes spiritually sober and thus gives up attachment to fleeting material relationships. The word vihaìgäù, "birds," would in this case refer to swans, the symbol of essential discrimination.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes Rüpa Gosvämé as follows in connection with this verse:
bhaìgyä tyägaucité tasya
khagänäm api khedanät
yatra sänuçayaà proktä
tad bhaved abhijalpitam
"When a lover indirectly states with remorse that her beloved is fit to be given up, such speech, uttered like the plaintive crying of a bird, is called abhijalpa." (Ujjvala-nélamaëi 14.194)

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté categorizes this statement of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's as äjalpa, as defined by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé:

"A statement spoken in disgust, describing how the male lover is deceitful and brings one misery, and also implying that He gives happiness to others, is known as äjalpa." (Ujjvala-nélamaëi 14.196)

O friend of My dear one, has My beloved sent you here again? I should honor you, friend, so please choose whatever boon you wish. But why have you come back here to take us to Him, whose conjugal love is so difficult to give up? After all, gentle bee, His consort is the goddess Çré, and she is always with Him, staying upon His chest.
In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda explains the context of this verse: "While Rädhäräëé was talking with the bee and the bee was flying hither and thither, it all of a sudden disappeared from Her sight. She was in full mourning due to separation from Kåñëa and felt ecstasy by talking with the bee. But as soon as the bee disappeared, She became almost mad, thinking that the messenger-bee might have returned to Kåñëa to inform Him all about Her talking against Him. 'Kåñëa must be very sorry to hear it,' She thought. In this way She was overwhelmed by another type of ecstasy.
"In the meantime, the bee, flying hither and thither, appeared before Her again. She thought, 'Kåñëa is still kind to Me. In spite of the messenger's carrying disruptive messages, He is so kind that He has again sent the bee to take Me to Him.' Çrématé Rädhäräëé was very careful this time not to say anything against Kåñëa."
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that the goddess of fortune, Çré, has the power to assume many different forms. Thus when Kåñëa enjoys other women, she stays on His chest in the form of a golden line. When He is not consorting with other women, she puts aside this form and gives Him pleasure in Her naturally beautiful form of a young woman.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, this statement of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's expresses pratijalpa, as described by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé:
dustyaja-dvandva-bhäve 'smin
präptir närhety anuddhatam
düta-sammänanenoktaà
yatra sa pratijalpakaù
"When the lover humbly states that although she is unworthy of attaining her beloved she cannot give up hoping for a conjugal relationship with Him, such words, spoken with respect for her beloved's message, are called pratijalpa." (Ujjvala-nélamaëi 14.198)
Here Çrématé Rädhäräëé has given up Her harsh feelings and humbly acknowledges the greatness of Çré Kåñëa.

O Uddhava! It is indeed regrettable that Kåñëa resides in Mathurä. Does He remember His father's household affairs and His friends, the cowherd boys? O great soul! Does He ever talk about us, His maidservants? When will He lay on our heads His aguru-scented hand?
The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 6.68).
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté writes very poetically, with deep spiritual insight, about the emotions expressed in this and the previous nine verses. He interprets Rädhäräëé's feelings as follows:
Çrématé Rädhäräëé thought, "Since Kåñëa was once satisfied in Vraja but left for Mathurä City, won't He also develop a desire to leave that place and go somewhere else? Mathurä is so close to Våndävana that it's possible He may even come back here.
"Kåñëa is the son of a respectable gentleman, Nanda Mahäräja, so He must be staying in Mathurä because of His sense of obligation to His father, who authorized His going there. On the other hand, while Nanda's whole life is dedicated exclusively to Kåñëa, Nanda is so innocent that he allowed himself to be tricked by the Yadus, who brought Kåñëa to Mathurä. Kåñëa must be thinking, 'Alas, alas! Since even My father could not bring Me back to Vraja, what can I do to return there?' Thus Kåñëa must be impatient to come back here, and so He has sent you, a messenger.
"It is only because Nanda is so innocent that he allowed his son to leave. If Nanda had allowed Kåñëa's mother, the queen of Vraja, to do so, she would have climbed onto Akrüra's chariot and, holding her son by the neck, gone off to Mathurä with Him, followed by all the gopés. But this was not possible.
"Ever since Kåñëa left, Nanda has been stunned by separation from Him, and Nanda's treasury rooms, storehouses, kitchens, sleeping quarters, opulent houses and so on are now vacant. Unswept and uncleansed, they are littered with grass, dust, leaves and cobwebs. Does Kåñëa ever remember His father's houses? And does He sometimes remember Subala and His other friends, who are now lying stunned in other neglected houses?
"The women in Mathurä who now associate with Kåñëa cannot know how to serve Him in the way that pleases Him most. When they see He is not satisfied and ask how they can make Him happy, does He tell them about us gopés?
"Kåñëa must tell them, 'You city ladies cannot please Me as much as the gopés of Vraja. They are most expert in stringing flower garlands, perfuming their bodies with ointments, playing various rhythms and melodies on stringed instruments, dancing and singing in the räsa performance, displaying their beauty, charm and cleverness, and skillfully playing at questions and answers. They are especially expert in the pastimes of meeting one's lover and showing jealous anger and other signs of pure love and affection.' Surely Kåñëa must know this. Therefore He'll probably tell the women of Mathurä, 'My dear women of the Yadu clan, please go back to your families. I no longer desire to associate with you. In fact, I'm going back to Vraja early tomorrow morning.'
"When will Kåñëa speak like this and come back here to place His hand, fragrant with aguru, on our heads? Then He will console us, saying, 'O beloveds of My heart, I swear to you that I will never abandon you again and go elsewhere. Indeed, I have not been able to find anyone in all the three worlds with even a trace of your good qualities.' "
Thus Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté interprets the feelings of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. The äcärya further explains that the present text displays the speech called sujalpa, as described by Rüpa Gosvämé:
yaträrjavät sa-gämbhéryaà
sa-dainyaà saha-cäpalam
sotkaëöhaà ca hariù påñöaù
sa sujalpo nigadyate
"When, out of honest sincerity, a lover questions Çré Hari with gravity, humility, unsteadiness and eagerness, such speech is known as sujalpa." (Ujjvala-nélamaëi 14.200)
Concluding this section of Chapter Forty-seven, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that there are ten divisions of divine madness (divyonmäda), which are expressed by the ten divisions of citra-jalpa, or variegated speech. Such divine madness is shown in the special pastime of bewilderment, which is itself part of the supreme bliss, mahä-bhäva, of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. The äcärya quotes the following verses from Rüpa Gosvämé's Ujjvala-nélamaëi (14.174, 178-80) to explain these ecstasies:
präyo våndävaneçvaryäà
mohano 'yam udaïcati
etasya mohanäkhyasya
gatià käm apy upeyuñaù
bhramäbhä käpi vaicitré

prajalpaù parijalpitaù
vijalpo 'jjalpa-saïjalpaù
avajalpo 'bhijalpitam
äjalpaù pratijalpaç ca
sujalpaç ceti kértitaù
"It is virtually only within the princess of Våndävana [Çrématé Rädhäräëé] that the ecstasy of bewilderment arises. She has attained to a special stage of this bewilderment, a wonderful state that resembles delusion. Known as divyonmäda, it has many aspects, which come and go unsteadily, and one of these manifestations is citra-jalpa. This talk, induced by Her seeing Her beloved's friend, is filled with covered anger and comprises many different ecstasies. It culminates in Her intense, anxious eagerness.
"This citra-jalpa has ten divisions, known as prajalpa, parijalpa, vijalpa, ujjalpa, saïjalpa, avajalpa, abhijalpa, äjalpa, pratijalpa and sujalpa."
Finally, some authorities say that Kåñëa Himself, eager to drink the sweetness of His beloved's speech, assumed the form of the messenger bee.

[Uddhava sang:] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brähmaëa, or even as Lord Brahmä himself?
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that here the term brahma-janmabhiù, "brahminical births," refers to the threefold birth by (1) seminal parenthood, (2) sacred-thread initiation and (3) sacrificial initiation. These cannot compare to pure Kåñëa consciousness.

kva—where, in comparison; imäù—these; striyaù—women; vana—in the forests; caréù—who wander; vyabhicära—by improper behavior; duñöäù—contaminated; kåñëe—for Kåñëa; kva ca—and where; eñaù—this; parama-ätmani—for the Supreme Soul; rüòha-bhävaù—stage of perfect love (known technically as mahä-bhäva); nanu—certainly; éçvaraù—the Personality of Godhead; anubhajataù—to one who constantly worships Him; aviduñaù—not learned; api—even though; säkñät—directly; çreyaù—the highest good; tanoti—bestows; agada—of medicines; räjaù—the king (namely, the nectar which the demigods drink for long life); iva—as if; upayuktaù—taken.
How amazing it is that these simple women who wander about the forest, seemingly spoiled by improper behavior, have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Kåñëa, the Supreme Soul! Still, it is true that the Supreme Lord Himself awards His blessings even to an ignorant worshiper, just as the best medicine works even when taken by a person ignorant of its ingredients.
The use of the word kva in the first two lines indicates a sharp contrast between apparently incompatible items, in this case the apparently insignificant and even impure position of the gopés, mentioned in the first line, and their attainment of the highest perfection of life, mentioned in the second. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté describes three types of adulterous women. The first is a woman who enjoys both her husband and a lover, being faithful to neither. Both ordinary society and the scriptures condemn this conduct. The second type of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband to enjoy only with her lover. Society and the scriptures also condemn this behavior, although such a fallen woman may be said to at least have the good quality of dedicating herself to a single man. The last kind of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband and enjoys in the attitude of being a lover of the Supreme Lord alone. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that although foolish, common people criticize this position, such behavior is commended by those who are wise in spiritual science. Therefore learned members of society and the revealed scriptures praise such single-minded devotion to the Lord. Such was the gopés' behavior. Thus the term vyabhicära-duñöäù, "corrupted by deviation," indicates the apparent resemblance between the gopés' behavior and that of ordinary adulterous women.

When Lord Çré Kåñëa was dancing with the gopés in the räsa-lélä, the gopés were embraced by the arms of the Lord. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Indeed, never was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the beauty and fragrance of a lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to material estimation?
The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from Çréla Prabhupäda's English rendering of Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 8.80).
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments as follows: Lord Kåñëa, the best of all avatäras, exists on the highest platform of purity and morality, and thus He always remained praiseworthy by all, even while accepting worldly criticism for His cow-tending, wandering in the forest, taking meals with young monkeys, stealing yogurt, seducing other men's wives, and so on. Similarly, the gopés, who are constituted of the Lord's pleasure potency, achieved the highest standard of purity and auspiciousness, even in comparison to the goddesses of fortune, and thus the gopés are supremely glorious, even though they were criticized by worldly people because they were mere cowherd women living in the forest and behaving in an apparently improper way.

The gopés of Våndävana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kåñëa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to become one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Våndävana, because the gopés trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.
The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from Çréla Prabhupäda's English rendering of Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 7.47).
Çré Uddhava here shows the perfect Vaiñëava attitude of humility. He does not pray to be equal to the gopés in their exalted stage of love, but rather to take birth as a bush or creeper in Våndävana so that when they walk upon him he will get the dust of their feet and thus be blessed. The shy gopés would never agree to give such blessings to a great personality like Uddhava; therefore he cleverly sought to get such mercy by taking birth as a plant in Våndävana.

O Supreme Absolute Truth, with Your personal energies You create this universe and then enter into it. Thus one can perceive You in many different forms by hearing from authorities and by direct experience.
The grammatical agreement of çruta-pratyakña-gocaram, in the neuter gender, with ätma-såñöam idaà viçvam indicates that the Supreme Lord, by entering His creation with His potencies, makes Himself perceivable within the universe. Throughout the Bhägavatam and other authorized Vedic literatures, we often find descriptions of the Lord's simultaneous supremacy over all other things and His identity with them. We cannot reasonably draw any other conclusion from Vedic literature than the one powerfully preached by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu: acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva. That is, the Absolute Truth is greater than and distinct from everything (since He is the omnipotent creator and controller of all), and simultaneously one with everything (since all that exists is the expansion of His own power).
Throughout these chapters of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, we also observe one of the unique, extraordinary features of this great work. Whether Kåñëa is sending His message to the gopés or accepting the prayers of Akrüra, there is constant philosophical discussion. Throughout the Bhägavatam, the steady combination of fascinating pastimes with persistent spiritual philosophy is an extraordinary feature. We are allowed to glimpse and even to relish the spiritual emotions of the Lord and His liberated associates, and yet we are constantly reminded of their ontological position lest we lapse into a cheap, anthropomorphic vision. Thus it is entirely in character with the work that Akrüra, in his ecstasy, glorifies the Lord with precise philosophical prayers.

You create, destroy and also maintain this universe with Your personal energies—the modes of passion, ignorance and goodness—yet You are never entangled by these modes or the activities they generate. Since You are the original source of all knowledge, what could ever cause You to be bound by illusion?
The phrase jïänätmanas te kva ca bandha-hetuù, "Since You are constituted of knowledge, what could be a cause of bondage for You?" definitely indicates the obvious, that the omniscient Supreme God is never in illusion. Therefore the impersonalistic theory that we are all God but have forgotten and are now in illusion is refuted here in the pages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

deha—of the body; ädi—and so on; upädheù—as material, designative coverings; anirüpitatvät—because of not being determined; bhavaù—birth; na—not; säkñät—literal; na—nor; bhidä—duality; ätmanaù—for the Supreme Soul; syät—exists; ataù—therefore; na—no; bandhaù—bondage; tava—Your; na eva—nor, in fact; mokñaù—liberation; syätäm—if they occur; nikämaù—by Your sweet will; tvayi—concerning You; naù—our; avivekaù—erroneous discrimination.
Since it has never been demonstrated that You are covered by material, bodily designations, it must be concluded that for You there is neither birth in a literal sense nor any duality. Therefore You never undergo bondage or liberation, and if You appear to, it is only because of Your desire that we see You in that way, or simply because of our lack of discrimination.
Here Akrüra states two reasons why the Lord appears to be covered by a material form, or to take birth like a human being. First, when Lord Kåñëa executes His pastimes, His loving devotees think of Him as their beloved child, friend, lover and so on. In the ecstasy of this loving reciprocation, they do not think of Kåñëa as God. For example, because of her extraordinary love for Him, Mother Yaçodä worries that Kåñëa will be injured in the forest. That she feels this way is the desire of the Lord, which is here indicated by the word nikämaù. The second reason the Lord may appear material is indicated by the word avivekaù: Simply because of ignorance, a lack of discrimination, one may misunderstand the position of the Personality of Godhead. In the Eleventh Canto of the Bhägavatam, in Lord Kåñëa's discussion with Çré Uddhava, the Lord elaborately discusses His transcendental position beyond bondage and liberation. As stated in Vedic literature, deha-dehi-vibhägo 'yaà neçvare vidyate kvacit: "There is never a distinction of body and soul in the Supreme Lord." In other words, Çré Kåñëa's body is eternal, spiritual, omniscient and the reservoir of all pleasure.

You have done this to relieve the earth's burden by killing hundreds of armies led by kings who are expansions of the demigods' enemies, and also to spread the fame of our dynasty.
The term suretaräàça-räjïäm indicates that the demoniac kings slain by Kåñëa were in fact expansions or incarnations of the enemies of the demigods. This fact is elaborately explained in the Mahäbhärata, which reveals the specific identities of the demoniac kings.

Today, O Lord, my home has become most fortunate because You have entered it. As the Supreme Truth, You embody the forefathers, ordinary creatures, human beings and demigods, and the water that has washed Your feet purifies the three worlds. Indeed, O transcendent one, You are the spiritual master of the universe.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has nicely interpreted Akrüra's feelings as follows:
Akrüra said, "My Lord, although I am a householder, today my home has become more pious than the forests where sages perform austerities. Why? Simply because You have entered my home. Indeed, You are the personification of the deities who preside over the five sacrifices a householder must perform daily to atone for unavoidable violence committed to living beings in the home. You are the spiritual truth behind all these creations, and now You have entered my home."
The five daily sacrifices enjoined for a householder are (1) sacrifice to Brahman by studying the Vedas, (2) sacrifice to the forefathers by making offerings to them, (3) sacrifice to all creatures by putting aside a portion of one's meals, (4) sacrifice to human beings by extending hospitality and (5) sacrifice to the demigods by performing fire sacrifices and so on.

What learned person would approach anyone but You for shelter, when You are the affectionate, grateful and truthful well-wisher of Your devotees? To those who worship You in sincere friendship You reward everything they desire, even Your own self, yet You never increase or diminish.
This verse describes both the Lord and His devotees as suhådaù "well-wishers." The Lord is the well-wisher of His devotee, and the devotee lovingly desires all happiness for the Lord. Even in this world, an excess of love may sometimes produce unnecessary solicitude. For example, we often observe that a mother's loving concern for her adult child is not always justified by an actual danger to the child. A grown child may be wealthy, competent and healthy, and yet the mother's loving concern continues. Similarly, a pure devotee always feels loving concern for Lord Kåñëa, as exemplified by Mother Yaçodä, who could only think of Kåñëa as her beautiful son.
Lord Kåñëa had promised Akrüra that after killing Kaàsa He would visit his home, and now the Lord kept His promise. Akrüra recognizes this and glorifies the Lord as åta-giraù, "one who is true to His word." The Lord is kåta-jïa, grateful for whatever little worship a devotee offers, and even if the devotee forgets, the Lord does not.

Çré Mucukunda said: O Lord, the people of this world, both men and women, are bewildered by Your illusory energy. Unaware of their real benefit, they do not worship You but instead seek happiness by entangling themselves in family affairs, which are actually sources of misery.
Mucukunda immediately makes it clear that he is not going to ask the Lord for material blessings. He has advanced, spiritually, far beyond those who try to exploit religion for all kinds of material benefits. Artha means "value," and the negation of this word, anartha, means "that which is valueless or useless." Thus the term anartha-dåk indicates those whose vision is focused on valueless things, who have not understood what actual artha, or value, is. All that glitters is not gold, and Mucukunda here emphatically states that we should not ruin our spiritual chances by entangling ourselves in the fool's gold of bodily relationships. We are meant to love the Lord.

That person has an impure mind who, despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness of a material home.
Our real home is in the kingdom of God. Despite our tenacious determination to remain in our material home, death will rudely eject us from the theater of material affairs. To stay at home is not bad, nor is it bad to devote ourselves to our loved ones. But we must understand that our real home is eternal, in the spiritual kingdom.
The word ayatnataù indicates that human life has been automatically awarded to us. We have not constructed our human bodies, and therefore we should not foolishly claim, "This body is mine." The human form is a gift of God and should be used to achieve the perfection of God consciousness. One who does not understand this is asan-mati, possessed of dull, mundane understanding.

I have wasted all this time, O unconquerable one, becoming more and more intoxicated by my domain and opulence as an earthly king. Misidentifying the mortal body as the self, becoming attached to children, wives, treasury and land, I suffered endless anxiety.
Having in the previous verse condemned those who misuse the valuable human form of life for mundane purposes, Mucukunda now admits that he himself falls into this category. He intelligently wants to take advantage of the Lord's association and become a pure devotee once and for all.

A man obsessed with thoughts of what he thinks needs to be done, intensely greedy, and delighting in sense enjoyment is suddenly confronted by You, who are ever alert. Like a hungry snake licking its fangs before a mouse, You appear before him as death.
We may note here the contrast between the words pramattam and apramattaù. Those who are trying to exploit the material world are pramatta: "deluded, bewildered, maddened by desire." But the Lord is apramatta: "alert, sober, and unbewildered." In our madness we may deny God or His laws, but the Lord is sober and will not fail to reward or punish us according to the quality of our activities.

The body that at first rides high on fierce elephants or chariots adorned with gold and is known by the name "king" is later, by Your invincible power of time, called "feces," "worms," or "ashes."
In the United States and other materially developed countries, dead bodies are cosmetically disposed of in a tidy ceremonial way, but in many parts of the world old, sickly and injured people die in lonely or neglected places, where dogs and jackals consume their bodies and transform them into stool. And if one is so blessed as to be buried in a coffin, one's body may very well be consumed by worms and other minuscule creatures. Also, many earthly cadavers are burned and thus transformed into ashes. In any case, death is certain, and the ultimate fate of the body is never sublime. That is the real purport of Mucukunda's statement here—that the body, though now called "king," "prince," "beauty queen," "upper-middle class" and so on, will eventually be called "stool," "worms" and "ashes."
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé quotes the following Vedic statement:
yoneù sahasräëi bahüni gatvä
duùkhena labdhväpi ca mänuñatvam
sukhävahaà ye na bhajanti viñëuà

"After passing through many thousands of species and undergoing great struggle, the conditioned living entities finally obtain the human form. Thus those human beings who still do not worship Lord Viñëu, who can bring them real happiness, have certainly become enemies of both themselves and humanity."

bhava—of material existence; apavargaù—the cessation; bhramataù—who has been wandering; yadä—when; bhavet—occurs; janasya—for a person; tarhi—at that time; acyuta—O infallible Lord; sat—of saintly devotees; samägamaù—the association; sat-saìgamaù—saintly association; yarhi—when; tadä—then; eva—only; sat—of the saintly; gatau—who is the goal; para—of superior (the causes of material creation); avara—and inferior (their products); éçe—for the Supreme Lord; tvayi—Yourself; jäyate—is born; matiù—devotion.
When the material life of a wandering soul has ceased, O Acyuta, he may attain the association of Your devotees. And when he associates with them, there awakens in him devotion unto You, who are the goal of the devotees and the Lord of all causes and their effects.
Äcäryas Jéva Gosvämé and Viçvanätha Cakravarté agree on the following point: Although it is stated here that when material life ceases one attains the association of devotees, in fact it is the association of the Lord's devotees that enables one to transcend material existence. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains this apparent inversion of sequence by quoting the Kävya-prakäça (10.153) as follows: kärya-käraëayoç ca paurväparya-viparyayo vijïeyätiçayoktiù syät sa. "A statement in which the logical order of a cause and its effect is reversed should be understood as atiçayokti, emphasis by extreme assertion." Çréla Jéva Gosvämé cites the following commentary on this statement: käraëasya çéghra-kärétäà vaktuà käryasya pürvam uktau. "To express the swift action of a cause, one may assert the result before the cause."
In this connection Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that the merciful association of the Lord's devotees makes possible our determination to become Kåñëa conscious. And the äcärya agrees with Çréla Jéva Gosvämé that this verse is an instance of atiçayokti.

Therefore, O Lord, having put aside all objects of material desire, which are bound to the modes of passion, ignorance and goodness, I am approaching You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for shelter. You are not covered by mundane designations; rather, You are the Supreme Absolute Truth, full in pure knowledge and transcendental to the material modes.
The word nirguëam here indicates that the Lord's existence is beyond the qualities of material nature. One might argue that Lord Kåñëa's body is made of material nature, but here the word advayam refutes that argument. There is no duality in Lord Kåñëa's existence. His eternal, spiritual body is Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is God.

Rukmiëé was a king's daughter, courageous and bold, and furthermore she would rather die than lose Kåñëa. Considering all this, she wrote a frank, explicit letter, begging Kåñëa to come and take her away.

The äcäryas comment as follows on this verse: "Rukmiëé felt that no one could obtain Lord Kåñëa by the efforts of a single lifetime. Therefore she earnestly pointed out the pious activities she had performed in that life and previous lives, hoping to convince Çré Kåñëa to come."

As Çréla Prabhupäda points out in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rukmiëé, being born of royal blood, certainly had a brilliant grasp of political affairs. She advised Çré Kåñëa to enter the city alone and unnoticed and then surround Himself with His military commanders so He could do what was needed. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté compares the coming fight to the Lord's churning of the ocean to extract the goddess Lakñmé. Gorgeous Rukmiëé, the goddess of fortune, would be gained in the coming turbulence.

Since I will be staying within the inner chambers of the palace, You may wonder, "How can I carry you away without killing some of your relatives?" But I shall tell You a way: On the day before the marriage there is a grand procession to honor the royal family's deity, and in this procession the new bride goes outside the city to visit Goddess Girijä.
Clever Rukmiëé anticipated a possible objection on the part of Çré Kåñëa. He certainly would not object to subduing rascals like Çiçupäla and Jaräsandha, but He might be reluctant to injure or kill Rukmiëé's relatives, some of whom might block His way to the palace's inner sanctum, where the women were protected. The procession to or from the temple of Girijä (Durgä) would provide the perfect opportunity for Kåñëa to kidnap Rukmiëé without harming her relatives.

O lotus-eyed one, great souls like Lord Çiva hanker to bathe in the dust of Your lotus feet and thereby destroy their ignorance. If I cannot obtain Your mercy, I shall simply give up my vital force, which will have become weak from the severe penances I will perform. Then, after hundreds of lifetimes of endeavor, I may obtain Your mercy.

Desiring to create, O unborn master, You increase and then assume the mode of passion.

You are time, the pradhäna, and the puruña, O Lord of the universe, yet still You are separate and distinct.
The word jagataù in the third line of this verse indicates that the functions of creation, maintenance and annihilation are here mentioned in a cosmic context.
The word utkaöam indicates that when a particular function is being carried out, whether universal creation, maintenance or annihilation, the particular material quality associated with that function becomes predominant.

This is illusion: that earth, water, fire, air, ether, sense objects, demigods, mind, the senses, false ego and the total material energy exist independent of You. In fact, they are all within You, my Lord, who are one without a second.
The earth-goddess, in her prayers, directly touches upon the subtleties of transcendental philosophy, clarifying that although the Supreme Lord is unique and distinct from His creation, His creation has no independent existence and always rests within Him. Thus the Lord and His creation are simultaneously one and different, as explained by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu five hundred years ago.
To say that everything is God, without any distinction, is meaningless, since nothing can act like God. Dogs, shoes and human beings are hardly omnipotent or omniscient, nor do they create the universe. On the other hand, there is a real sense in which all things are one, for everything is part of the same supreme, absolute reality. Lord Caitanya has given the very useful analogy of the sun and the sunrays. The sun and its sunshine are one reality, for the sun is the celestial body that shines. On the other hand, one can certainly distinguish between the sun globe and the sunrays. Thus God's simultaneous oneness with and difference from His creation is the final and satisfying explanation of reality. All that exists is the Lord's potency, and yet He endows the superior potency, the living beings, with free will so that they can become responsible for the moral and spiritual quality of their decisions and activities.
This entire transcendental science is clearly and rationally explained in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

Çré Rukmiëé said: Actually, what You have said is true, O lotus-eyed one. I am indeed unsuitable for the almighty Personality of Godhead. What comparison is there between that Supreme Lord, who is master of the three primal deities and who delights in His own glory, and myself, a woman of mundane qualities whose feet are grasped by fools?
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé lists the faults Lord Kåñëa had described in Himself that He claimed disqualified Him from being Rukmiëé's husband. These include incompatibility, fearfulness, taking shelter in the ocean, quarreling with the powerful, abandoning His kingdom, uncertainty as to His identity, acting against ordinary standards of behavior, having no good qualities, being praised falsely by beggars, aloofness, and lack of desire for family life. The Lord claimed that Rukmiëé had failed to recognize these bad qualities in Him. Now she begins to respond to all the Lord's statements.
First she responds to Çré Kåñëa's statement in Text 11 of this chapter: kasmän no vavåñe 'samän. "Why did you select Us, who are not equal to you?" Here Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé says that she and Kåñëa are certainly not equal, for no one can be equal to the Supreme Lord. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further points out that in her extreme humility Rukmiëé is identifying herself with the Lord's external energy, which in fact is her expansion, Rukmiëé being the goddess of fortune.

Yes, my Lord Urukrama, You lay down within the ocean as if afraid of the material modes, and thus in pure consciousness You appear within the heart as the Supersoul. You are always battling against the foolish material senses, and indeed even Your servants reject the privilege of royal dominion, which leads to the blindness of ignorance.
In Text 12 Lord Kåñëa said, räjabhyo bibhyataù su-bhru samudram çaraëaà gatän: "Out of fear of the kings, We took shelter in the ocean." Here Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé points out that the actual rulers of this world are the guëas, the material modes of nature, which impel all living beings to act. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that because Lord Kåñëa fears that His devotee will come under the influence of the modes of nature and become entangled in sense gratification, He enters the internal ocean of their hearts, where He remains as the omniscient Supersoul (upalambhana-mätra ätmä). Thus He protects His devotees. The word upalambhana-mätraù also indicates that the Lord is the object of meditation for His devotees.
In Text 12 Lord Kåñëa also said, balavadbhiù kåta-dveñän: "We created enmity with the powerful." Here Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé points out that it is the material senses which are actually powerful in this world. The Supreme Lord has taken up the battle against sense gratification on the part of His devotees, and thus He is constantly trying to help them in their struggle for spiritual purity. When the devotees become free of unwanted material habits, the Lord reveals Himself to them, and then the eternal loving relationship between the Lord and His devotees becomes an irrevocable fact.
In the same verse Kåñëa stated, tyakta-nåpäsanän: "We renounced the royal throne." But here Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé points out that the position of political supremacy in this world usually implicates so-called powerful leaders in darkness and blindness. As the saying goes, "Power corrupts." Thus even the Lord's loving servants tend to shy away from political intrigue and power politics. The Lord Himself, being completely satisfied in His own spiritual bliss, would hardly be interested in occupying mundane political positions. Thus Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé correctly interprets the Lord's actions as evidence of His supreme transcendental nature.

Your movements, inscrutable even for sages who relish the honey of Your lotus feet, are certainly incomprehensible for human beings who behave like animals. And just as Your activities are transcendental, O all-powerful Lord, so too are those of Your followers.
Here Queen Rukmiëé replies to Lord Kåñëa's statement in Text 13:

ästhitäù padavéà su-bhru
präyaù sédanti yoñitaù
"O fine-browed lady, women are usually destined to suffer when they stay with men whose behavior is uncertain and who pursue a path not approved by society."
In the present verse Rukmiëé is taking the term aloka-patham to mean "unworldly path." Those who are entangled in worldly behavior are trying to enjoy this world more or less like animals. Even if such people are "culturally advanced," they should simply be considered sophisticated or polished animals. Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé points out that because the Lord's activities are always transcendental, they are aspañöa, or "unclear," to ordinary people, and even the sages trying to know the Lord cannot perfectly understand these activities.

You possess nothing because there is nothing beyond You. Even the great enjoyers of tribute—Brahmä and other demigods—pay tribute to You. Those who are blinded by their wealth and absorbed in gratifying their senses do not recognize You in the form of death. But to the gods, the enjoyers of tribute, You are the most dear, as they are to You.
Here Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé replies to Lord Kåñëa's statement in Text 14:
niñkiïcanä vayaà çaçvan
niñkiïcana-jana-priyäù
tasmät präyeëa na hy äòhyä
mäà bhajanti su-madhyame
"We have no material possessions, and We are dear to those who similarly have nothing. Therefore, O slender one, the wealthy hardly ever worship Me."
Queen Rukmiëé begins her statement by saying niñkiïcano nanu, "You are indeed niñkiïcana." The word kiïcana means "something," and the prefix nir—or, as it appears here, niñ—indicates negation. Thus in the ordinary sense niñkiïcana means "one who does not have something," or, in other words, "one who has nothing."
But in the present verse Queen Rukmiëé states that Lord Kåñëa "possesses nothing" not because He is a pauper but because He Himself is everything. In other words, since Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth, all that exists is within Him. There is no second thing, something outside the Lord's existence, for Him to possess. For example, a man may possess a house or a car or a child or money, but these things do not become the man: they exist outside of him. We say he possesses them merely in the sense that he has control over them. But the Lord does not merely control His creation: His creation actually exists within Him. Thus there is nothing outside of Him that He can possess in the way that we possess external objects.
The äcäryas explain niñkiïcana in the following way: To state that a person possesses something implies that he does not possess everything. In other words, if we say that a man owns some property, we imply that he does not own all property but rather some specific property. A standard American dictionary defines the word some as "a certain indefinite or unspecified number, quantity, etc., as distinguished from the rest." The Sanskrit word kiïcana conveys this sense of a partial amount of the total. Thus Lord Kåñëa is called niñkiïcana to refute the idea that He possesses merely a certain amount of beauty, fame, wealth, intelligence and other opulences. Rather, He possesses infinite beauty, infinite intelligence, infinite wealth and so on. This is so because He is the Absolute Truth.
Çréla Prabhupäda begins his introduction to the First Canto, Volume One, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam with the following statement, which is quite relevant to our present discussion: "The conception of God and the conception of the Absolute Truth are not on the same level. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam hits on the target of the Absolute Truth. The conception of God indicates the controller, whereas the conception of the Absolute Truth indicates the summum bonum, or the ultimate source of all energies." Here Çréla Prabhupäda touches upon a fundamental philosophical point. God is commonly defined as "the supreme being," and the dictionary defines supreme as (1) highest in rank, power, authority, etc; (2) highest in quality, achievement, performance, etc; (3) highest in degree; and (4) final, ultimate. None of these definitions adequately indicates absolute existence.
For example, we may say that a particular American is supremely wealthy in the sense that he is wealthier than any other American, or we may speak of the Supreme Court as the highest court in the land, although it certainly does not have absolute authority in all political and social matters, since it shares authority in these fields with the legislature and the president. In other words, the word supreme indicates the best in a hierarchy, and thus the supreme being may merely be understood as the best or greatest of all beings but not as the very source of all other beings and, indeed, of everything that exists. Thus Çréla Prabhupäda specifically points out that the concept of the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, is higher than the concept of a supreme being, and this point is essential to a clear understanding of Vaiñëava philosophy.
Lord Kåñëa is not merely a supreme being: He is the absolute being, and that is exactly the point His wife is making. Thus the word niñkiïcana indicates not that Kåñëa possesses no opulence but rather all opulence. In that sense she accepts His definition of Himself as niñkiïcana.
In Text 14 Lord Kåñëa also stated, niñkiïcana-jana-priyäù: "I am dear to those who have nothing." Here, however, Queen Rukmiëé points out that the demigods, the wealthiest souls in the universe, regularly make offerings to the Supreme Lord. We may assume that the demigods, being the Lord's appointed representatives, know that everything belongs to Him in the sense that everything is part of Him, as explained above. Therefore the statement niñkiïcana-jana-priyäù is correct in the sense that since nothing exists except the Lord and His potencies, no matter how wealthy the Lord's worshipers appear to be they are in fact offering Him nothing but His own energy as a loving act. The same idea is exemplified when one worships the Ganges River by offering Ganges water, or when a child gets money from his father on the father's birthday and buys him a gift. The father is paying for his own present, but what he is really interested in is his child's love. Similarly, the Supreme Lord manifests the cosmos, and then the conditioned souls collect various items of the Lord's creation. Pious souls offer some of the best items from their collection back to the Lord as a sacrifice and thus purify themselves. Since the whole cosmos and everything in it is simply the Lord's energy, we may say that those who worship the Lord possess nothing.
In more conventional terms, people who are proud of their great wealth do not bow down to God. Queen Rukmiëé also mentions these fools. Satisfied with their temporary bodies, they do not understand the divine power of death, which stalks them. The demigods, however, who are by far the wealthiest living beings, regularly offer sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, and thus the Lord is most dear to them, as stated here.

Here Queen Rukmiëé refutes Lord Kåñëa's statement in Text 15:

"Marriage and friendship are proper between two people who are equal in terms of their wealth, birth, influence, physical appearance and capacity for good progeny, but never between a superior and an inferior." In fact, only those who have given up all such material conceptions of sense gratification and have taken exclusively to the Lord's loving service can understand who their real friend and companion is—Lord Çré Kåñëa Himself.

Knowing that great sages who have renounced the sannyäsé's daëòa proclaim Your glories, that You are the Supreme Soul of all the worlds, and that You are so gracious that You give away even Your own self, I chose You as my husband, rejecting Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and the rulers of heaven, whose aspirations are all frustrated by the force of time, which is born from Your eyebrows. What interest, then, could I have in any other suitors?
This is Queen Rukmiëé's refutation of Lord Kåñëa's statement in Text 16. There Lord Kåñëa said, bhikñubhiù çläghitä mudhä: "I am glorified by beggars." But Queen Rukmiëé points out that those so-called beggars are actually sages in the paramahaàsa stage of life—sannyäsés who have reached the highest level of spiritual advancement and thus given up the sannyäsé rod. Lord Kåñëa also made two specific accusations against His wife in Text 16. He said, vaidarbhy etad avijïäya—"My dear Vaidarbhé, you were not aware of the situation"—and tvayädérgha-samékñayä—"because you lack foresight." In the present verse, Rukmiëé's statement iti me våto 'si indicates "I chose You as my husband because You possess the above-mentioned qualities. It was not a blind choice at all." Rukmiëé further mentions that she passed over lesser personalities like Brahmä, Çiva and the rulers of heaven because she saw that even though, materially speaking, they are great personalities, they are frustrated by the powerful waves of time, which emanate from the eyebrows of Lord Kåñëa. Therefore, far from lacking foresight, Rukmiëé chose Lord Kåñëa after an exhaustive appraisal of the entire cosmic situation. Thus she lovingly rebukes her husband here.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté interprets Rukmiëé's mood as follows: "My dear husband, Your accusation that I lack foresight indicates that You did know of my deep insight into the situation. Actually, I chose You because I knew of Your true glories."

My Lord, as a lion drives away lesser animals to claim his proper tribute, You drove off the assembled kings with the resounding twang of Your Çärìga bow and then claimed me, Your fair share. Thus it is sheer foolishness, my dear Gadägraja, for You to say You took shelter in the ocean out of fear of those kings.
In Text 12 of this chapter Lord Kåñëa said, räjabhyo bibhyataù su-bhru samudraà çaranaà gatän: "Terrified of those kings, We went to the ocean for shelter." According to the äcäryas, Lord Kåñëa finally provoked Rukmiëé's anger by glorifying other men who might have been her husband, and thus in an agitated mood she here tells Him that she is not ignorant but rather that He has spoken foolishly. She states, "Like a lion You abducted me in the presence of those kings and drove them away with Your Çärìga bow, so it is simply foolishness to say that out of fear of those same kings You went to the ocean." According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, as Queen Rukmiëé spoke these words she frowned and cast angry sidelong glances at the Lord.

Wanting Your association, the best of kings—Aìga, Vainya, Jäyanta, Nähuña, Gaya and others—abandoned their absolute sovereignty and entered the forest to seek You out. How could those kings suffer frustration in this world, O lotus-eyed one?
Here Queen Rukmiëé refutes the ideas put forth by Lord Kåñëa in Text 13. In fact Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé repeats Lord Kåñëa's own words. The Lord said, ästhitäù padavéà su-bhru präyaù sédanti yoñitaù: "Women who follow My path generally suffer." Here Rukmiëé-devé says, sédanti te 'nupadavéà ta ihästhitäù kim: "Why should those fixed on Your path suffer in this world?" She gives the example of many great kings who renounced their powerful sovereignty to enter the forest, where they performed austerities and worshiped the Lord, intensely desiring His transcendental association. Thus, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé here intends to tell Çré Kåñëa, "You have said that I, a king's daughter, am unintelligent and frustrated because I married You. But how can You accuse all these great enlightened kings of being unintelligent? They were the wisest of men, yet they gave up everything to follow You and were certainly not frustrated by the result. Indeed, they achieved the perfection of Your association."

The aroma of Your lotus feet, which is glorified by great saints, awards people liberation and is the abode of Goddess Lakñmé. What woman would take shelter of any other man after savoring that aroma? Since You are the abode of transcendental qualities, what mortal woman with the insight to distinguish her own true interest would disregard that fragrance and depend instead on someone who is always subject to terrible fear?
In Text 16 Lord Kåñëa claimed that He was guëair hénäù, "bereft of all good qualities." To refute this claim, the devoted Rukmiëé here states that the Lord is guëälaya, "the abode of all good qualities." In a single moment the so-called powerful men of this world can be reduced to utter helplessness and confusion. Indeed, destruction is the inevitable fate of all powerful masculine bodies. The Lord, however, has an eternal, spiritual body that is omnipotent and infinitely beautiful, and thus, as Queen Rukmiëé argues here, how could any sane, enlightened woman take shelter of anyone but the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa?

Because You are suitable for me, I have chosen You, the master and Supreme Soul of all the worlds, who fulfill our desires in this life and the next. May Your feet, which give freedom from illusion by approaching their worshiper, give shelter to me, who have been wandering from one material situation to another.
An alternate reading for the word såtibhiù is çrutibhiù, in which case the idea Rukmiëé expresses is this: "I have been bewildered by hearing from various religious scriptures about numerous rituals and ceremonies with their promises of fruitive results." Çréla Çrédhara Svämé gives this explanation, while Çréla Jéva Gosvämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté give an additional idea Rukmiëé might express with the word çrutibhiù: "My dear Lord Kåñëa, I was bewildered by hearing about Your various incarnations. I heard that when You descended as Räma You abandoned Your wife, Sétä, and that in this life You abandoned the gopés. Thus I was bewildered."
It is understood that Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé is the eternally liberated consort of Lord Kåñëa, but in these verses she humbly plays the part of a mortal woman taking shelter of the Supreme Lord.

O infallible Kåñëa, let each of the kings You named become the husband of a woman whose ears have never heard Your glories, which are sung in the assemblies of Çiva and Brahmä. After all, in the households of such women these kings live like asses, oxen, dogs, cats and slaves.
According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, these fiery words of Queen Rukmiëé's are a response to Lord Kåñëa's opening statement, found in Text 10 of the chapter. The Supreme Lord had said, "My dear princess, You were sought after by many kings as powerful as the rulers of planets. They were all abundantly endowed with political influence, wealth, beauty, generosity and physical strength." According to Çrédhara Svämé, Queen Rukmiëé here speaks with anger, pointing her index finger at the Lord. She compares the so-called great princes to asses because they carry many material burdens, to oxen because they are always distressed while performing their occupational duties, to dogs because their wives disrespect them, to cats because they are selfish and cruel, and to slaves because they are servile in family affairs. Such kings may appear desirable to a foolish woman who has not heard or understood the glories of Çré Kåñëa.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté adds that such kings are like asses because their wives sometimes kick them, like dogs because they behave inimically toward outsiders in order to protect their homes, and like cats because they eat the remnants left by their wives.

A woman who fails to relish the fragrance of the honey of Your lotus feet becomes totally befooled, and thus she accepts as her husband or lover a living corpse covered with skin, whiskers, nails, head-hair and body-hair and filled with flesh, bones, blood, parasites, feces, mucus, bile and air.
Here Lord Kåñëa's chaste wife makes a quite unequivocal statement about material sense gratification based on the physical body. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments as follows on this verse: On the authority of the statement sa vai patiù syäd akuto-bhayaù svayam [SB 5.18.20]—"He indeed should become one's husband who can remove all fear"—Çré Kåñëa is the real husband for all women at all times. Thus a woman who worships someone else as her husband simply worships a dead body.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments further: Rukmiëé thus considered that although the sweetness of Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet is well known, and although He possesses an eternal body full of knowledge and bliss, foolish women reject Him. An ordinary husband's body is covered on the outside by skin and hair; otherwise, being filled with blood, feces, flesh, bile and so on, it would be overwhelmed with flies and other vermin attracted by its bad smell and other offensive qualities.
Those who have no practical experience of the beauty and purity of Kåñëa or of Kåñëa consciousness may be confused by such uncompromising denunciations of material, bodily gratification. But those who are enlightened in Kåñëa consciousness will be enlivened and enthused by such absolutely truthful statements.

O lotus-eyed one, though You are satisfied within Yourself and thus rarely turn Your attention toward me, please bless me with steady love for Your feet. It is when You assume a predominance of passion in order to manifest the universe that You glance upon me, showing me what is indeed Your greatest mercy.
In Text 20 of this chapter Lord Kåñëa stated, "Always satisfied within Ourselves, We care nothing for wives, children and wealth." Here Rukmiëé-devé humbly replies, "Yes, You take pleasure within Yourself and therefore rarely look at me."
In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that Lord Kåñëa had already declared His love for Rukmiëé (SB 10.53.2): tathäham api tac-citto nidräà ca na labhe niçi. "I am also thinking about her—so much so that I cannot sleep at night." Lord Kåñëa is satisfied within Himself, and if we remember that Çrématé Rukmiëé-devé is His internal potency, we can understand that His loving affairs with her are expressions of His pure spiritual happiness.
Here, however, Queen Rukmiëé humbly identifies herself with the Lord's external energy, which is her expansion. Therefore she says, "Though You do not often look at me, when You are ready to manifest the material universe and thus begin to work through the material quality of passion, which is Your potency, You glance at me. In this way You show me Your greatest mercy." Thus Äcärya Viçvanätha explains that Goddess Rukmiëé's statement can be understood in two ways. And of course the Vaiñëavas, after thoroughly understanding the philosophy of Kåñëa from the bona fide äcäryas, simply relish these loving affairs between the Lord and His exalted devotees.

The Çiva-jvara said: I bow down to You of unlimited potencies, the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul of all beings. You possess pure and complete consciousness and are the cause of cosmic creation, maintenance and dissolution. Perfectly peaceful, You are the Absolute Truth to whom the Vedas indirectly refer.
Previously the Çiva-jvara felt himself to be unlimitedly powerful and thus attempted to burn Çré Kåñëa. But now he himself has been burned, and understanding that Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, he humbly approaches to bow down and offer praise to the Absolute Truth.
According to the äcäryas, the word sarvätmänam indicates that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the Supersoul, the giver of consciousness to all living beings. Kåñëa confirms this in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15): mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca. "From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.''
In his commentary Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté emphasizes that the Çiva-jvara has realized in many ways Lord Kåñëa's supremacy over his own master, Lord Çiva. Thus the Çiva-jvara addresses Kåñëa as ananta-çakti, "possessor of unlimited potency"; pareça, "the supreme controller"; and sarvätmä, "the Supersoul of all beings ''—even of Lord Çiva.
The words kevalaà jïapti-mätram indicate that Lord Kåñëa possesses pure omniscience. According to our limited understanding, we act in this world, but Lord Kåñëa, with His unlimited understanding, performs infinite works of creation, maintenance and annihilation. As Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out, even the functions of the gross elements, such as air, depend on Him. The Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.8.1) confirms this: bhéñäsmäd vätaù-pavate. "Out of fear of Him, the wind blows." Thus Lord Çré Kåñëa is the ultimate object of worship for all living beings.

kälaù—time; daivam—destiny; karma—the reactions of material work; jévaù—the individual living entity; svabhävaù—his propensities; dravyam—the subtle forms of matter; kñetram—the body; präëaù—the life air; ätmä—the false ego; vikäraù—the transformations (of the eleven senses); tat—of all this; saìghäöaù—the aggregate (as the subtle body); béja—of seed; roha—and sprout; pravähaù—the constant flow; tvat—Your; mäyä—material illusory energy; eñä—this; tat—of it; niñedham—the negation (You); prapadye—I am approaching for shelter.
Time; fate; karma; the jéva and his propensities; the subtle material elements; the material body; the life air; false ego; the various senses; and the totality of these as reflected in the living being's subtle body—all these constitute Your material illusory energy, mäyä, an endless cycle like that of seed and plant. I take shelter of You, the negation of this mäyä.
The word béja-roha-praväha is explained as follows: The conditioned soul accepts a material body, with which he attempts to enjoy the material world. That body is the seed (béja) of future material existence because when a person acts with that body he creates further reactions (karma), which grow (roha) into the obligation to accept another material body. In other words, material life is a chain of actions and reactions. The simple decision to surrender to the Supreme Lord releases the conditioned soul from this futile repetition of material growth and reaction.
According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the words tan-niñedhaà prapadye indicate that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is niñedhävadhi-bhütam, "the limit of negation." In other words, after all illusion is negated, the Absolute Truth remains.
The process of education may be succinctly described as a way of eradicating ignorance through the attainment of knowledge. Through inductive, deductive and intuitive means, we attempt to refute the specious, the illusory and the imperfect and elevate ourselves to a platform of full knowledge. Ultimately, when all illusion is negated, that which remains firmly in place is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In the previous text, the Çiva-jvara described the Supreme Lord as sarvätmänaà kevalaà jïapti-mätram, "pure, concentrated spiritual consciousness." Now the Çiva-jvara concludes his philosophical description of the Lord by saying in this text that the various aspects of material existence are also potencies of the Supreme Lord.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that although the jéva is different from mäyä, here it is included among the constituents of mäyä because it is controlled by mäyä. Viçvanätha Cakravarté also mentions that the Supreme Lord's own body and senses, as implied here by the word tan-niñedhaà, are nondifferent from the Lord's pure spiritual existence. The Lord's body and senses are not external to Him, nor do they cover Him, but rather the Lord is identical with His spiritual form and senses. The full Absolute Truth, unlimited in fascinating diversity, is Lord Çré Kåñëa.

With various intentions, You perform pastimes to maintain the demigods, the saintly persons and the codes of religion for this world. By these pastimes You also kill those who stray from the right path and live by violence. Indeed, your present incarnation is meant to relieve the earth's burden.
As Lord Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.29),
samo 'haà sarva-bhüteñu
na me dveñyo 'sti na priyaù
ye bhajanti tu mäà bhaktyä
mayi te teñu cäpy aham
"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend—is in Me—and I am also a friend to him."
The demigods and sages (devän sädhün) are dedicated to executing the will of the Supreme Lord. The demigods act as cosmic administrators, and the sages, by their teachings and their good example, illumine the path of self-realization and holiness. But those who transgress the natural law, the law of God, and live by committing violence against others are vanquished by the Supreme Lord in His various pastime incarnations. As the Lord states in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.11), ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. He is impartial, but He responds appropriately to the actions of the living beings.

I am tortured by the fierce power of Your terrible fever weapon, which is cold yet burning. All embodied souls must suffer as long as they remain bound to material ambitions and thus averse to serving Your feet.
In the previous verse, the Çiva-jvara stated that those who live by violence will suffer similar violence at the hands of the Lord. But here he further states that those who do not surrender to the Supreme Lord are especially liable to punishment. Although the Çiva-jvara himself had acted violently up till now, since he has surrendered to the Lord and rectified himself, he hopes to receive the Lord's mercy. In other words, he has now become the Lord's devotee.

çré-rudraù uväca—Lord Çiva said; tvam—You; hi—alone; brahma—the Absolute Truth; param—supreme; jyotiù—light; güòham—hidden; brahmaëi—in the Absolute; väk-maye—in its form of language (the Vedas); yam—whom; paçyanti—they see; amala—spotless; ätmänaù—whose hearts; äkäçam—the sky; iva—like; kevalam—pure.
Çré Rudra said: You alone are the Absolute Truth, the supreme light, the mystery hidden within the verbal manifestation of the Absolute. Those whose hearts are spotless can see You, for You are uncontaminated, like the sky.
The Absolute Truth is the source of all light and is therefore the supreme light, self-luminous. This Absolute Truth is explained confidentially in the Vedas and is therefore difficult for an ordinary reader to understand. The following statements quoted by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé from the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad show how the Vedic sounds occasionally reveal the Absolute: Te hocur upäsanam etasya parätmano govindasyäkhilädhäriëo brühi (Pürva-khaëòa 17): "They [the four Kumäras] said [to Brahmä], 'Please tell us how to worship Govinda, the Supreme Soul and the foundation of all that exists.' " Cetanaç cetanänäm (Pürva-khaëòa 21): "He is the chief of all living beings." And taà ha devam ätma-våtti-prakäçam (Pürva-khaëòa 23): "One realizes that Supreme Godhead by first realizing one's own self." The great äcärya Jéva Gosvämé also quotes a verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.10.48)—güòhaà paraà brahma manuñya-liìgam—which refers to "the Supreme Truth concealed in a humanlike form."
Since the Lord is pure, why do some people perceive Kåñëa's form and activities as impure? Äcärya Jéva explains that those whose own hearts are impure cannot understand the pure Lord. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further quotes the Lord's own instruction to Arjuna in Çré Hari-vaàça:
tat-paraà paramaà brahma
sarvaà vibhajate jagat
mamaiva tad ghanaà tejo
jïätum arhasi bhärata
"Superior to that [total material nature] is the Supreme Brahman, from which this entire creation expands. O descendant of Bharata, you should know that the Supreme Brahman consists of My concentrated effulgence."
Thus, to save his devotee, Çiva now glorifies the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, his eternal worshipable master. The Lord's bewildering potency induced Çiva to fight with Lord Kåñëa, but now the fight is over, and to save his devotee Lord Çiva offers these beautiful prayers.

The sky is Your navel, fire Your face, water Your semen, and heaven Your head. The cardinal directions are Your sense of hearing, herbal plants the hairs on Your body, and water-bearing clouds the hair on Your head. The earth is Your foot, the moon Your mind, and the sun Your vision, while I am Your ego. The ocean is Your abdomen, Indra Your arm, Lord Brahmä Your intelligence, the progenitor of mankind Your genitals, and religion Your heart. You are indeed the original puruña, creator of the worlds.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that just as the tiny bugs living inside a fruit cannot comprehend the fruit, so we tiny living beings cannot understand the Supreme Absolute Truth, in whom we exist. It is difficult to understand the cosmic manifestation of the Lord, what to speak of His transcendental form as Çré Kåñëa. Therefore we should surrender in Kåñëa consciousness, and the Lord Himself will help us understand.

As Lord Çiva glorifies Lord Kåñëa doubt may arise, since, apparently, Lord Kåñëa is standing before Lord Çiva as a historical personality with a humanlike body. However, it is out of the Lord's causeless mercy that He appears to us in a form visible to our mundane eyes. If we want to understand the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, we must hear from recognized authorities in Kåñëa consciousness, such as Lord Kåñëa Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä, or from Lord Çiva, a recognized Vaiñëava authority, who here glorifies the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

You are the original person, one without a second, transcendental and self-manifesting. Uncaused, You are the cause of all, and You are the ultimate controller. You are nonetheless perceived in terms of the transformations of matter effected by Your illusory energy—transformations You sanction so that the various material qualities can become fully manifest.
The äcäryas comment as follows on this verse: Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that the term ädyaù puruñaù, "the original puruña," indicates that Lord Kåñëa expands Himself as Mahä-Viñëu, the first of the three puruñas who take charge of cosmic manifestation. The Lord is eka advitéyaù, "one without a second," because there is no one equal to the Lord or different from Him. No one is completely equal to the Supreme Godhead, and yet because all the living beings are expansions of the potency of the Godhead, no one is qualitatively different from Him. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu nicely explains this inconceivable situation by stating that the Absolute Truth and the living beings are qualitatively one but quantitatively different. The Absolute possesses infinite spiritual consciousness, whereas the living beings possess infinitesimal consciousness, which is subject to being covered by illusion.
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, commenting on the term ädyaù puruñaù, quotes from the Sätvata-tantra: viñëos tu tréëi rüpäëi. "There are three forms of Viñëu [for cosmic manifestation, etc.]." Çréla Jéva Gosvämé also quotes a statement of the Lord's from çruti: pürvam eväham ihäsam. "In the beginning I alone existed in this world." This statement describes the form of the Lord called the puruña-avatära, who exists before the cosmic manifestation. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé also quotes the following çruti-mantra: tat-puruñasya puruñatvam, which means "Such constitutes the Lord's status as puruña." Actually, Lord Kåñëa is the essence of the puruña incarnation because He is turéya, as described in the present verse. Jéva Gosvämé explains the term turéya (literally "the fourth") by quoting Çrédhara Svämé's commentary to the Bhägavatam verse 11.15.16:
viräö hiraëyagarbhaç ca
käraëaà cety upädhayaù
éçasya yat tribhir hénaà
turéyaà tad vidur budhäù
"The Lord's universal form, His Hiraëyagarbha form and the primeval causal manifestation of material nature are all relative conceptions, but because the Lord Himself is not covered by these three, intelligent authorities call Him 'the fourth.' "
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the word turéya indicates that the Lord is the fourth member of the quadruple expansion of Godhead called the Catur-vyüha. In other words, Lord Kåñëa is Väsudeva.
Lord Kåñëa is sva-dåk—that is, He alone can perceive Himself perfectly—because He is infinite spiritual existence, infinitely pure. He is hetu, the cause of everything, and yet He is ahetu, without cause. Therefore He is éça, the supreme controller.
The last two lines of this verse are of special philosophical significance. Why is the Lord perceived differently by different persons, although He is one? A partial explanation is given here. By the agency of Mäyä, the Lord's external potency, material nature is in a constant state of transformation, vikära. In one sense, then, material nature is "unreal," asat. But because God is the supreme reality, and because He is present within all things and all things are His potency, material objects and energies possess a degree of reality. Therefore some people see one aspect of material energy and think, "This is reality," while other people see a different aspect of material energy and think, "No, that is reality." Being conditioned souls, we are covered by different configurations of material nature, and thus we describe the Supreme Truth or the Supreme Lord in terms of our corrupted vision. Yet even the covering qualities of material nature, such as our conditioned intelligence, mind and senses, are real (being the potency of the Supreme Lord), and therefore through all things we can perceive, in a more or less subjective way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is why the present verse states, pratéyase: "You are perceived." Furthermore, without the manifestation of material nature's covering qualities, the creation could not fulfill its purpose—namely, to allow the conditioned souls to make their best attempt to enjoy without God so that they will finally understand the futility of such an illusory notion.

O almighty one, just as the sun, though hidden by a cloud, illuminates the cloud and all other visible forms as well, so You, although hidden by the material qualities, remain self-luminous and thus reveal all those qualities, along with the living entities who possess them.
Here Lord Çiva further clarifies the idea expressed in the final two lines of the previous verse. The analogy of the clouds and the sun is appropriate. With its energy the sun creates clouds, which cover our vision of the sun. Yet it is the sun that allows us to see the clouds and all other things as well. Similarly, the Lord expands His illusory potency and thus prevents us from directly seeing Him. Yet it is God alone who reveals to us His covering potency—namely, the material world—and thus the Lord is ätma-pradépa, "self-luminous." It is the reality of His existence that makes all things visible.

Their intelligence bewildered by Your mäyä, fully attached to children, wife, home and so on, persons immersed in the ocean of material misery sometimes rise to the surface and sometimes sink down.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that "rising in the ocean of misery" indicates elevation to higher species, such as demigods, and that "being submerged" refers to degradation to lower species—even to immobile forms of life such as trees. As stated in the Väyu Puräëa, viparyayaç ca bhavati brahmatva-sthävaratvayoù: "The living being rotates between the position of Brahmä and that of an unmoving creature."
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out that Çiva, having glorified the Lord, now pursues his original intention of securing the Lord's grace for Bäëäsura. Thus in this and the following four verses, Lord Çiva instructs Bäëa on his actual position in relation to the Lord. Çiva's appeal to the Lord for compassion toward Bäëa appears in Text 45.

Equipoised and perfectly at peace, You are the true friend, Self and worshipable Lord. You are one without a second, the shelter of all the worlds and all souls.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé states that the Lord is a true friend because He sets one's proper intelligence into motion if one desires to know the truth about God and the soul. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté both emphasize that the term bhaväpavargäya indicates the highest liberation of pure love of Godhead, characterized by unalloyed devotional service unto the Lord.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also explains that the Supreme Lord is samam, "perfectly objective and balanced," whereas other living beings, having an incomplete grasp of reality, cannot be perfectly objective. Those who surrender unto the Lord also become fully objective by taking shelter of His supreme consciousness.

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments as follows on this verse: His faith emboldened upon receiving the Lord's mercy and thus attaining the status of servitude, King Någa properly glorifies the Lord by chanting His names and then asks the Lord's permission to take his leave. The spirit of his prayer is as follows: "You are Devadeva, God even of the gods, and Jagannätha, the master of the universe, so please be my master. O Govinda, please make me Your property with the same merciful glance You use to enchant the cows. You can do this because You are Puruñottama, the supreme form of Godhead. O Näräyaëa, since You are the foundation of the living entities, please be my support, even though I am a bad living entity. O Håñékeça, please make my senses Your own. O Puëyaçloka, now You have become famous as the deliverer of Någa. O Acyuta, please never be lost to my mind. O Avyaya, You will never diminish in my mind." Thus the great Bhägavatam commentator Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains the purport of these verses.

I offer my repeated obeisances unto You, Kåñëa, the son of Vasudeva. You are the source of all beings, the Supreme Absolute Truth, the possessor of unlimited potencies, the master of all spiritual disciplines.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé comments that King Någa here offers his obeisances to Brahman—that is, the Absolute Truth—who is unchanged in spite of performing activities. Since ancient times, Western philosophers have puzzled over the question of how God can be unchanging and yet perform activities. Çrédhara Svämé states that this doubt is answered here by the term ananta-çaktaye, which describes the Lord as "the possessor of unlimited potency." Thus through the Lord's infinite potencies He can perform innumerable activities without changing His essential nature.
The king further offers his obeisances to Çré Kåñëa, the possessor of the form of eternal bliss and the supreme goal of life. The holy name of Kåñëa is analyzed in a verse from the Mahäbhärata (Udyoga-parva 71.4), which Çréla Prabhupäda quotes in his Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 9.30, purport):
kåñir bhü-väcakaù çabdo
ëaç ca nirvåti-väcakaù
tayor aikyaà paraà brahma
kåñëa ity abhidhéyate
"The word kåñ is the attractive feature of the Lord's existence, and na means 'spiritual pleasure.' When the verb kåñ is added to na, it becomes kåñëa, which indicates the Absolute Truth."
King Någa offers the above prayers as he is about to leave the personal association of the Supreme Lord.

As we well know, You descend by Your sweet will in order to bestow the highest good on this universe by maintaining and protecting it. Thus Your glories are widely sung.
As pointed out by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, all living beings are in fact servants of the Lord. The äcärya quotes the following verse from the Padma Puräëa to elucidate:
a-käreëocyate viñëuù
çrér u-käreëa kathyate
ma-käras tu tayor däsaù
païca-viàçaù prakértitaù
"[In the mantra om] the letter a signifies Lord Viñëu, the letter u signifies the goddess Çré, and the letter m refers to their servant, who is the twenty-fifth element." The twenty-fifth element is the jéva, the living being. Every living being is a servant of the Lord, and the Lord is the true friend of every living being. Thus even when the Lord chastises envious persons like Jaräsandha, such punishment amounts to real friendship, since both the Lord's chastisement and His blessing are for the benefit of the living being.

O Lord, please give me Your leave. I will wander about the worlds, which are flooded with Your fame, loudly singing about Your pastimes, which purify the universe.
Even Närada Muni was bewildered to see Lord Kåñëa's amazing pastimes as a human being. Therefore, with the words anujänéhi mäà deva he requests permission to return to his normal service of traveling and preaching. Inspired by what he has seen, he wants to preach widely the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa.

Çrédhara Svämé explains that the kings present their entreaty in this and the following five verses. In this verse they take shelter of the Lord, in the next three verses they describe their fear, and in the last two verses they make their prayerful request.

People in this world are always engaged in sinful activities and are thus bewildered about their real duty, which is to worship You according to Your commandments. This activity would truly bring them good fortune. Let us offer our obeisances unto the all-powerful Lord, who appears as time and suddenly cuts down one's stubborn hope for a long life in this world.
Lord Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.27),
yat karoñi yad açnäsi
yaj juhoñi dadäsi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kuruñva mad-arpaëam
"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform—do that, O son of Kunté, as an offering to Me."
This is the Supreme Lord's commandment, but people in general are bewildered and neglect this auspicious activity, preferring instead to perform sinful activities that lead them to terrible suffering. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is working to enlighten the world about this most essential activity of loving service to the Lord.

You are the predominating Lord of the universe and have descended into this world with Your personal power to protect the saintly and suppress the wicked. We cannot understand, O Lord, how anyone can transgress Your law and still continue to enjoy the fruits of his work.
Çrédhara Svämé explains that the kings were bewildered by the suffering that had come upon them. They state here that since the Lord has descended to this world to protect the pious and punish the wicked, how is it that Jaräsandha, who brazenly transgressed the order of the Lord, continued to perform his wicked activities, whereas the kings were put into a miserable condition? Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura similarly states that the kings could not understand how Jaräsandha, who harassed the saintly devotees and nourished the envious, could continue to prosper, whereas the kings were being tormented by the wicked Jaräsandha. Similarly Çréla Prabhupäda quotes the kings as follows in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: "Dear Lord, You are the proprietor of all the worlds, and You have incarnated Yourself along with Your plenary expansion Lord Balaräma. It is said that Your appearance in this incarnation is for the purpose of protecting the faithful and destroying the miscreants. Under the circumstances, how is it possible that miscreants like Jaräsandha can put us into such deplorable conditions of life against Your authority? We are puzzled at the situation and cannot understand how it is possible. It may be that Jaräsandha has been deputed to give us such trouble because of our past misdeeds, but we have heard from revealed scriptures that anyone who surrenders unto Your lotus feet is immediately immune to the reactions of sinful life. We therefore offer ourselves wholeheartedly unto Your shelter, and we hope that Your Lordship will now give us full protection."

O Lord, with this corpselike body, always full of fear, we bear the burden of the relative happiness of kings, which is just like a dream. Thus we have rejected the real happiness of the soul, which comes by rendering selfless service to You. Being so very wretched, we simply suffer in this life under the spell of Your illusory energy.
After expressing their doubts in the previous verse, the kings herein admit that actually they are suffering because of their own foolishness, having given up the eternal happiness of the soul in exchange for the temporary, conditional happiness of a so-called kingly position. Most people make a similar mistake, desiring wealth, power, prestige, aristocratic family and so on, in exchange for their own soul. The kings admit that they have fallen under the spell of the Lord's illusory energy and have mistaken the tremendous anxiety of political leadership for happiness.

The kings here pray for the Lord to release them from the bondage of karma created by the Lord's material potency. The kings make it clear that Jaräsandha is so powerful that there is no hope for them to escape by their own power.

O wielder of the disc! Your strength is unlimited, and thus seventeen times You crushed Jaräsandha in battle. But then, absorbed in human affairs, You allowed him to defeat You once. Now he is so filled with pride that he dares to torment us, Your subjects. O unconquerable one, please rectify this situation.
The word nå-loka-niratam indicates that the Lord was absorbed in playing within the world of human beings. Thus, while acting like a human king He allowed Jaräsandha to be victorious in a single battle after the Lord had crushed him seventeen times. The kings here imply that Jaräsandha is especially harassing them because they are souls surrendered to Lord Kåñëa. Therefore they beg the Lord, "O You who hold the cakra weapon high, please make the proper arrangement."
Çréla Prabhupäda expresses the kings' feelings as follows: "My dear Lord, You have already fought with Jaräsandha eighteen times consecutively, out of which You have defeated him seventeen times by surpassing his extraordinary powerful position. But in Your eighteenth fight You exhibited Your human behavior, and thus it appeared that You were defeated. My dear Lord, we know very well that Jaräsandha cannot defeat You at any time, because Your power, strength, resources and authority are all unlimited. No one can equal You or surpass You. The appearance of defeat by Jaräsandha in the eighteenth engagement is nothing but an exhibition of human behavior. Unfortunately, foolish Jaräsandha could not understand Your tricks, and he has since then become puffed up over his material power and prestige. Specifically, he has arrested us and imprisoned us, knowing fully that as Your devotees, we are subordinate to Your sovereignty."

O master, Madhusüdana, we do not blame this King of Magadha, since it is actually by Your mercy that kings fall from their royal position, O almighty Lord.
It is significant that upon seeing Lord Kåñëa and thus becoming purified of their sins, the kings did not feel any mundane hatred or bitterness toward Jaräsandha, who had imprisoned them. Simply by seeing Lord Kåñëa, the kings came to the position of Kåñëa consciousness and spoke these verses, which show deep spiritual wisdom.

Infatuated with his opulence and ruling power, a king loses all self-restraint and cannot obtain his true welfare. Thus bewildered by Your illusory energy, he imagines his temporary assets to be permanent.
The word unnaddha indicates that one who is intoxicated by false pride goes beyond the boundaries of proper behavior. Human life is meant to be governed by dharma, spiritual principles for gradual advancement to the perfection of Kåñëa consciousness. Blinded by wealth and power, however, a foolish person does not hesitate to act whimsically, against the laws of nature and God. Unfortunately, this is now the situation in the prosperous Western countries.

Now that You have mercifully destroyed our pride, we beg simply to remember Your lotus feet.

Never again will we hanker for a miragelike kingdom—a kingdom that must be slavishly served by this mortal body, which is simply a source of disease and suffering and which is declining at every moment. Nor, O almighty Lord, will we hanker to enjoy the heavenly fruits of pious work in the next life, since the promise of such rewards is simply an empty enticement for the ears.
One must work very hard to maintain a kingdom or political sovereignty. And yet the body, which works so hard to maintain one's political power, is itself doomed. At every moment the mortal body moves toward death, and all along the way the body is subject to many painful diseases. The whole affair of mundane power is thus a waste of time for the pure soul, who needs to revive his dormant Kåñëa consciousness.
The Vedic scriptures and other religious scriptures contain many promises of prosperity and heavenly enjoyment in the next life for one who acts piously in this life. Such promises are pleasing to the ears, but they are nothing more than that. Material enjoyment, whether in heaven or in hell, is a type of illusion for the pure soul. By the personal association of Lord Kåñëa, the fortunate kings have now realized the higher spiritual reality beyond the phantasmagoria of the material creation.

"For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Påthä, because of his constant engagement in devotional service."
The words api saàsaratäm iha indicate that the kings were approaching Lord Kåñëa not merely for liberation but rather for the boon of always being able to remember His lotus feet. Such constant remembrance is a symptom of love, and love of Godhead is the actual goal of life.

That You, the lotus-eyed Supreme Lord, accept the orders of wretched fools who presume themselves rulers is a great pretense on Your part, O all-pervading one.
Çréla Prabhupäda writes, "[Yudhiñöhira said,] 'O Kåñëa, You are unlimited, and although we sometimes think of ourselves as royal kings and rulers of the world and become puffed up over our paltry positions, we are very poor in heart. Actually, we are fit to be punished by You, but the wonder is that instead of punishing us You so kindly and mercifully accept our orders and carry them out properly. We are all very much surprised that Your Lordship can play the part of an ordinary human being, but we can understand that You are performing these activities just like a dramatic artist.' "

But of course the power of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Soul, the primeval one without a second, is neither increased nor diminished by His activities, any more than the sun's power is by its movements.
Çréla Prabhupäda writes in Kåñëa: "[King Yudhiñöhira said,] 'Your real position is always exalted, exactly like that of the sun, which always remains at the same temperature during both the time of its rising and the time of its setting. Although we feel the difference in temperature between the rising and the setting sun, the temperature of the sun never changes. You are always transcendentally equipoised, neither pleased nor disturbed by any condition of material affairs. You are the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, and for You there are no relativities.' "
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé quotes a similar statement from the Vedic mantras: na karmaëä vardhate no kanéyän (Çatapatha Brähmaëa 14.7.2.28, Taittiréya Brähmaëa 3.12.9.7 and Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 4.4.23). "He is not increased by His activities, nor does He become lesser." As explained here by King Yudhiñöhira, the Lord is one without a second. There is no other entity in His supreme category, and thus it is simply by His causeless mercy that He agrees to carry out the orders of His pure devotees, like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. There is certainly no loss of status for the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He thus extends His causeless mercy to His surrendered devotees.

O unconquerable Mädhava, even Your devotees make no distinctions of "I" and "mine," "you" and "yours," for this is the perverted mentality of animals.
An ordinary person thinks, "I am so attractive, intelligent and wealthy that people should simply serve me and do what I want. Why should I obey anyone else?" This proud, separatist mentality is also found in animals who battle one another for supremacy. Such a mentality is conspicuously absent in the mind of an advanced devotee, and it is certainly absent in the sublime, omniscient mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Indeed, the humanlike pastimes of the Almighty are simply a pretense! Effortlessly, He alone sends forth from His Self this variegated creation, maintains it and then swallows it up again, all without becoming entangled, just as the element earth takes on many names and forms in its various transformations.
The one Supreme expands Himself as many without diminishing His completeness. He does this effortlessly, without depending on anyone or anything else. This mystic process of the Lord's self-expansion is incomprehensible to all but Himself, but the example of the substance earth and its manifold products bears enough resemblance to provide some idea. The same example is also presented in an often—cited passage of the Chändogya Upaniñad (6.1.4), väcärambhaëaà vikäro nämadheyaà måttikety eva satyam: "Earth's transformations are merely verbal creations of the process of naming; the substance earth itself is alone real."
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé suggests that this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam answers a possible objection on the part of Lord Kåñëa: "How can I create, maintain and destroy the universe if I am Vasudeva's son?" The answer is given by the words aho vibhümnaç caritaà viòambanam: "You are the perfectly complete whole, and Your birth and pastimes are only an imitation of ordinary persons' activities in the material world.

This verse describes the Lord's enlightening people in general (jana-saìgraha) and His imitation of worldly behavior.

Neither these kings nor even the Våñëis, who enjoy Your intimate association, know You as the Soul of all existence, the force of time and the supreme controller. For them You are covered by the curtain of Mäyä.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that Lord Kåñëa's family, the Våñëis, were too familiar with Him to realize that He is the Supersoul residing in the heart of every created being. And those kings at Kurukñetra who were not devotees of Kåñëa could not recognize Him as time, the annihilator of everything. Devotees and nondevotees are both covered by Mäyä, but in different ways. For the materialists Mäyä is illusion, but for the Vaiñëavas she acts as Yogamäyä, the internal potency who covers their awareness of the Supreme Lord's majesty and engages them in His eternal pleasure pastimes.

A sleeping person imagines an alternative reality for himself and, seeing himself as having various names and forms, forgets his waking identity, which is distinct from the dream. Similarly, the senses of one whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceive only the names and forms of material objects. Thus such a person loses his memory and cannot know You.
Just as a person's dream is a secondary reality created from the stock of his memories and desires, so this universe exists as the inferior creation of the Supreme Lord, in no real way separate from Him. And just as the person who awakens from sleep experiences the higher reality of his waking life, so the Supreme Lord also has His distinct, higher reality beyond everything we know of this world.

Today we have directly seen Your feet, the source of the holy Ganges, which washes away volumes of sins. Perfected yogés can at best meditate upon Your feet within their hearts. But only those who render You wholehearted devotional service and in this way vanquish the soul's covering—the material mind—attain You as their final destination. Therefore kindly show mercy to us, Your devotees.
The holy river Ganges has the power to destroy all sorts of sinful reactions because she originates at the Lord's lotus feet and thus contains the dust of His feet. Explaining this verse, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé says, "If the Lord might advise the sages that they need not concern themselves with devotional practices because they are already far advanced in spiritual knowledge and austerity, they hereby respectfully decline such a suggestion, pointing out that only those yogés who have destroyed their material mind and ego by surrendering to Kåñëa in pure devotional service can attain full perfection. They conclude by praying to the Lord that He favor them in the most merciful way by making them His devotees."

As taught in the Säìkhya doctrine of Lord Kapiladeva, pradhäna is the creative energy of the puruña, the Supreme Person. Thus, of these two principles, the pradhäna is the predominated energy, female, incapable of independent action, while the puruña is the absolutely independent, primeval creator and enjoyer. Neither Kåñëa nor His brother Balaräma belong to the category of subordinate energy; rather, both of Them together are the original puruña, who is always joined by His manifold potencies of pleasure, knowledge and creative emanation.

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who manifest as the Lord of both nature and the creator of nature [Mahä-Viñëu]. Everything that comes into existence, however and whenever it does so, is created within You, by You, from You, for You and in relation to You.
To casual observers the known world appears to be produced by many different agents. A good indication of this conception is language itself, which traditional Sanskrit grammarians explain as reflecting the visible diversity of nature. In the standard Sanskrit grammar taught by the sage Päëini, the verb, expressing action, is taken to be the essential core of a sentence, and all the other words function in relation to it. Nouns, for example, are put into any of several cases to show their particular relationship to the verb in a sentence. These relationships of noun to verb are called kärakas, namely the relations of subject (kartä, "who does"), object (karma, "what is done"), instrument (karaëa, "by which"), recipient (sampradäna, "for or toward which"), source (apädäna, "from or because of which") and location (adhikaraëa, "in which"). Apart from these kärakas, nouns may also sometimes point to other nouns in a possessive sense, and there are also various kinds of adverbs of time, place and manner. But although language thus seems to indicate the activity of many separate agents in the manifest creation, the deeper truth is that all grammatical forms refer first of all to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse Vasudeva makes this point by glorifying his two exalted sons in terms of the different grammatical forms.

O transcendental Lord, from Yourself You created this entire variegated universe, and then You entered within it in Your personal form as the Supersoul. In this way, O unborn Supreme Soul, as the life force and consciousness of everyone, You maintain the creation.
When creating the material universe, the Lord expands Himself as the Paramätmä, or Supersoul, and accepts the creation as His universal body. No material body has any reason for existing without some jéva soul desiring it for his enjoyment, and no jéva can independently maintain a body without the Paramätmä accompanying him there for guidance. The Vaiñëava äcäryas, in their commentaries on the Second Canto of Çrémad Bhägavatam, explain that even before Brahmä is born from the lotus navel of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, he first accepts the whole material energy, the mahat-tattva, as his body. Thus Brahmä is the jéva embodied by the universe, and Viñëu is the Paramätmä who joins him. Brahmä must organize the specific manifestations of creation, but he cannot begin to do so until Lord Viñëu expands Himself again into the subtle energy of action—which is the sütra-tattva, or original vital air—and also into the creative energy of consciousness, buddhi-tattva.

Whatever potencies the life air and other elements of universal creation exhibit are actually all personal energies of the Supreme Lord, for both life and matter are subordinate to Him and dependent on Him, and also different from one another. Thus everything active in the material world is set into motion by the Supreme Lord.
Präëa is the vital air of life, a more subtle element than the ordinary air we can touch. And because präëa is so subtle—finer than the tangible manifestations of creation—it is sometimes considered the ultimate source of everything. But even subtle energies such as präëa depend for their functional capacity on the supremely subtle Paramätmä. That is the idea Vasudeva expresses here by the word päratantryät, "because of dependence." Just as the velocity of an arrow is derived from the strength of the bowman who shoots it, so all subordinate energies depend on the power of the Supreme Lord.
Furthermore, even when various subtle causes have been empowered with their capacity to act, they cannot act in concert without the Supersoul's coordinating direction. As Lord Brahmä states in his description of creation in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam,
yadaite 'saìgatä bhävä

"O Närada, best of the transcendentalists, the forms of the body cannot manifest as long as these created parts, namely the elements, senses, mind and modes of nature, are not assembled. Thus when all these became assembled by the force of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this universe certainly came into being by accepting both the primary and secondary causes of creation." (SB 2.5.32-33)

Çré Vasudeva, in telling Kåñëa that He is the essence of the sun, moon, stars, lightning and fire, is only reiterating the opinion of scripture, both çruti and småti. The Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.14), for example, states,

"There [in the spiritual sky] the sun does not shine, nor does the moon, the stars or lightning as we know them, what to speak of ordinary fire. It is by the reflection of the spiritual sky's effulgence that everything else gives light, and thus through its radiance this entire universe becomes luminous." And in Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä (15.12), the Supreme Lord says,
yad äditya-gataà tejo

You are the directions and their accommodating capacity, the all-pervading ether and the elemental sound residing within it. You are the primeval, unmanifested form of sound; the first syllable, oà; and audible speech, by which sound, as words, acquires particular references.
In accordance with the general process of creation, speech always becomes audible in stages, which proceed from subtle inner impulse to outward expression. These stages are mentioned in the mantras of the Åg Veda (1.164.45):
catväri väk-parimitä padäni
täni vidur brähmaëä ye manéñiëaù
guhäyäà tréëi nihitäni neìgayanti

"Discriminating brähmaëas know of four progressive stages of language. Three of these remain hidden within the heart as imperceptible vibrations, while the fourth stage is what people ordinarily understand as speech."

You are the power of the senses to reveal their objects, the senses' presiding demigods, and the sanction these demigods give for sensory activity. You are the capacity of the intelligence for decision-making, and the living being's ability to remember things accurately.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that whenever one of the material senses is involved with its object, the presiding demigod of that particular sense organ must give his sanction. Äcärya Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains the word anusmåti in this verse in its higher sense, as one's recognition of himself as an eternal spirit soul.

The modes of material nature—namely goodness, passion and ignorance—together with all their functions, become directly manifest within You, the Supreme Absolute Truth, by the arrangement of Your Yogamäyä.
Vasudeva's description of how the Supreme Lord expands Himself into the products of the three material modes may possibly be misunderstood to imply that He is touched by the modes, or even that He is subject to destruction. To negate these misunderstandings, Vasudeva states here that the three modes and their products function by the arrangement of the Lord's creative energy, Yogamäyä, who is always completely under His control. Thus the Lord is never tainted in the least by any material contact.

Thus these created entities, transformations of material nature, do not exist except when material nature manifests them within You, at which time You also manifest within them. But aside from such periods of creation, You stand alone as the transcendental reality.
When the universe is wound up at the time of its periodic annihilation, all the inert objects and bodies of living beings that hitherto were manifested by the Lord's Mäyä become disconnected from His sight. Then, since He maintains no association with them during the period of universal dissolution, they in fact no longer exist. In other words, material manifestations have real, functioning existence only when the Lord turns His attention to the creation and maintenance of the material cosmos. The Lord is never "within" these objects in any material sense, but He does mercifully pervade them all as the impersonal Brahman, and as the Paramätmä He enters within every atom and also accompanies the jéva souls in their individual embodiments. As the Lord describes in His own words in the verses of Bhagavad-gétä (9.4-5):
mayä tataà idaà sarvaà
jagad avyakta-mürtinä
mat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni
na cähaà teñv avasthitaù

"By Me, in My unmanifest form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them. And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Self is the very source of creation."

They are truly ignorant who, while imprisoned within the ceaseless flow of this world's material qualities, fail to know You, the Supreme Soul of all that be, as their ultimate, sublime destination. Because of their ignorance, the entanglement of material work forces such souls to wander in the cycle of birth and death.
A soul who forgets his true identity as a servant of God is sent to this world to be imprisoned in a succession of material bodies. Wrongly identifying himself with these bodies, such a conditioned soul suffers the consequent distress of karmic action and reaction. Vasudeva, as a compassionate Vaiñëava, laments for the suffering conditioned souls, whose unhappiness, the result of ignorance, can be remedied by knowledge of the principles of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa.

You are not our sons but the very Lords of both material nature and its creator [Mahä-Viñëu]. As You Yourself have told us, You have descended to rid the earth of the rulers who are a heavy burden upon her.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, in this verse Vasudeva offers himself and his wife as excellent examples of those who are materially deluded. Although at the time of His birth in Kaàsa's prison Lord Kåñëa told Vasudeva and Devaké that His mission was to rid the earth of unwanted kñatriyas, still His two parents could not avoid thinking of Him as their helpless son who needed protection from King Kaàsa. In reality, of course, both Vasudeva and Devaké were participating in the divine pastime of the Lord's birth under the perfect direction of His internal energy; only out of transcendental humility does Vasudeva criticize himself in this way.

Enough with hankering for sense enjoyment, which makes me identify with this mortal body and think of You, the Supreme, as my child.
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé suggests that Vasudeva condemns himself here for thinking of trying to gain special opulences because he is the father of the Supreme Lord. Thus Vasudeva contrasts himself with Nanda, the king of Vraja, who was satisfied with pure love of God and nothing else.

Indeed, while still in the maternity room You told us that You, the unborn Lord, had already been born several times as our son in previous ages.

O supremely glorified, all-pervading Lord, who can understand the mystic, deluding potency of Your opulent expansions?
Lord Kåñëa was first born to Vasudeva and Devaké in their previous lives as Sutapä and Påçni. Later they again became His parents as Kaçyapa and Aditi. This, then, was the third time He had appeared as their son.

Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains this verse as follows: The Lord of Vaikuëöha, Näräyaëa, is but one expansion of Çré Kåñëa. Mahä-Viñëu, the first creator, is Lord Näräyaëa's expansion. The total material energy emanates from Mahä-Viñëu's glance, and of that total material energy the three modes of nature are divided portions. Thus it is Çré Kåñëa, acting through His expansions, who generates, sustains and dissolves the universe.

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté identifies the supreme Ananta named here as Lord Balaräma, from whom expands the divine serpent Ananta Çeña.

Many who had been constantly absorbed in enmity toward You ultimately became attracted to You, who are the direct embodiment of transcendental goodness and whose divine form comprises the revealed scriptures. These reformed enemies include Daityas, Dänavas, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyädharas, Cäraëas, Yakñas, Räkñasas, Piçäcas, Bhütas, Pramathas and Näyakas, and also ourselves and many others like us. Some of us have become attracted to You because of exceptional hatred, while others have become attracted because of their mood of devotion based on lust. But the demigods and others infatuated by material goodness feel no such attraction for You.
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains this passage as follows: The Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyädharas and Cäraëas are adversaries of the Supreme Lord when they follow the lead of the Daitya and Dänava demons. The Yakñas, Räkñasas, Piçäcas and so on tend to be inimical because they are generally covered by ignorance. There are some rascals in the pure mode of ignorance, like Çiçupäla and Pauëòraka, who are totally absorbed in meditation on the Lord as their enemy, and this fixed consciousness earns them liberation. Others, in a mixed condition of passion and ignorance, associate with the Lord with a desire for position and prestige; Mahäräja Bali sees himself as belonging to this category. Yet Lord Viñëu favored Bali by becoming his doorkeeper in the subterranean region of Sutala, just as He favored the demons by killing and liberating them, and the Gandharvas by engaging them in singing His glories. On the other hand, the Lord awards sense gratification to those demigods who are proud of their being situated in the mode of goodness; thus they become deluded and forget Him.

Systematic understanding of something should include knowledge of both its svarüpa, or essential identity, and also its viçeñas, the attributes that make it different from other things. Mäyä, the energy underlying all material existence, is more subtle than ordinary phenomena. Only God and His liberated devotees, therefore, can know its svarüpa and viçeña.

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté states that in response to Bali's prayers, Çré Kåñëa invited him to choose some benediction, and in this verse Bali submits his request. Bali begs to be relieved of the entanglement of material life so he will be free to leave home and wander in the wilderness, with only the Lord's lotus feet as his shelter. For his subsistence, Bali proposes, he will take help from the forest trees, at whose feet are fruits to eat and leaves to sleep on, for all to use as needed. And if the Lord is especially merciful to him, Bali hopes, he will not have to wander alone but will be allowed to travel in the company of Lord Kåñëa's devotees.

The äcäryas explain Bali's thoughts as follows. Reflecting on the possibility that his request for immediate deliverance may have been too bold, Bali Mahäräja considers that first he will need to become sufficiently purified. In any case, he thinks, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma must have come to him for some specific purpose; if he can receive the Lords' order and carry it out, that will be his best opportunity for purification. Indeed, as Bali states, a devotee acting under the Personality of Godhead's instruction need no longer follow the sacrificial injunctions and prohibitions of the Vedas.

He glorifies the Lord as the witness of all pious and impious actions, confident that the Lord remembers whatever little devotional service he has ever done. And he glorifies Him as self-illumined, never needing to be enlightened or informed by any external source, with the knowledge that the Lord has always been aware of Bahuläçva's long-cherished secret desire to see Him.

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments that the king offered these prayers to encourage Lord Kåñëa to remain at his home for some days. The king thought, "Since contact with the Supreme Lord can free anyone from misconceptions and doubts, Kåñëa's presence in my home will fortify my intelligence so that I can withstand the onslaughts of material desires. In His expansion as Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, the Lord always resides in Badarikäçrama for the good of the whole land of Bharata, and so He may also create good fortune for the land of Mithilä by remaining here for at least a few days. Since Lord Kåñëa's propensity is toward peace and simplicity, He will certainly prefer my simple home to the excessive opulence of Dvärakä."

In somewhat the same way, the Lord manifests the cosmos. Of course, the creation is not illusory for the Lord, but it is for those souls who are put under the control of His Mäyä potency. As her service to the Lord, Mäyä deludes the conditioned souls into accepting as real her temporary, insubstantial manifestations.

The all-merciful Lord is in everyone's heart. Seeing Him there, however, is possible only when one's heart is completely purified. Materialists may demand that God prove His existence by coming into view as a result of their empirical investigations, but God has no need to respond to such impudence.

Let me offer my obeisances unto You. You are realized as the Supreme Soul by those who know the Absolute Truth, whereas in Your form of time You impose death upon the forgetful souls. You appear both in Your causeless spiritual form and in the created form of this universe, thus simultaneously uncovering the eyes of Your devotees and obstructing the vision of the nondevotees.
When the Lord appears before His devotees in His eternal, spiritual form, their eyes become "uncovered" in the sense that all vestiges of illusion are dispelled and they drink in the beautiful vision of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. For the nondevotees, on the other hand, the Lord "appears" as material nature, His universal form, and in this way He covers their vision so that His spiritual, personal form remains invisible to them.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté gives another interpretation of this verse, based on an alternative understanding of anätmane, a form of the word anätmä: Various classes of men know the Absolute Truth in different ways. The devotees of the Lord who are in the reciprocal mood of neutral admiration (çänta-rasa) meditate on the Supreme as possessing a divine, personal form (ätmä or çré-vigraha) transcending all aspects of material illusion. The impersonal philosophers (jïänés) conceive of Him as formless (anätmä). And the envious demons see Him in the form of death.

çré-çrutayaù ücuù—the Vedas said; jayajaya—victory to You, victory to You; jahi—please defeat; ajäm—the eternal illusory potency of Mäyä; ajita—O unconquerable one; doña—to create discrepancies; gåbhéta—who has assumed; guëäm—the qualities of matter; tvam—You; asi—are; yat—because; ätmanä—in Your original status; samavaruddha—complete; samasta—in all; bhagaù—opulences; aga—nonmoving; jagat—and moving; okasäm—of those who possess material bodies; akhila—of all; çakti—the energies; avabodhaka—O You who awaken; te—You; kvacit—sometimes; ajayä—with Your material energy; ätmanä—and with Your internal, spiritual energy; ca—also; carataù—engaging; anucaret—can appreciate; nigamaù—the Vedas.
The çrutis said: Victory, victory to You, O unconquerable one! By Your very nature You are perfectly full in all opulences; therefore please defeat the eternal power of illusion, who assumes control over the modes of nature to create difficulties for conditioned souls. O You who awaken all the energies of the moving and nonmoving embodied beings, sometimes the Vedas can recognize You as You sport with Your material and spiritual potencies.
According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the twenty-eight verses of the prayers of the personified Vedas (Texts 14–41) represent the opinions of each of the twenty-eight major çrutis. These chief Upaniñads and other çrutis concern themselves with various approaches to the Absolute Truth, and among them those çrutis are supreme which emphasize pure, unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Upaniñads direct our attention to the Personality of Godhead by first negating what is distinct from Him and then defining some of His important characteristics.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté interprets the first words of this prayer, jaya jaya, to mean "please reveal Your superexcellence." The word jaya is repeated out of either reverence or joy.
"How should I reveal My excellence?" the Lord might ask.
The çrutis answer by requesting Him to mercifully destroy the ignorance of all living beings and attract them to His lotus feet.
The Lord says, "But Mäyä, who imposes ignorance on the jévas, is full of good qualities [gåbhéta-guëäm]. Why should I oppose her?"
"Yes," the Vedas answer, "but she has taken on the three modes of nature to bewilder the conditioned souls and make them falsely identify with their material bodies. Her modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, moreover, are tainted [doña-gåbhéta] because You are not manifest in their presence."
The çrutis go on to address the Lord as ajita, implying that "only You cannot be conquered by Mäyä, whereas others, like Brahmä, are defeated by their own faults."
The Lord responds, "But what proof do you have that she cannot conquer Me?"
"The proof lies in the fact that in Your original state You have already realized the perfection of all opulences."
At this point the Lord might object that merely destroying the ignorance of the jévas will not suffice to bring them to His lotus feet, since the jéva soul, even after his ignorance is dispelled, cannot attain the Lord without engaging in devotional service. As the Lord states in His own words, bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù: "I am attainable only through devotional service." (SB 11.14.21)
To this objection the çrutis reply, "My Lord, O You who awaken all energies, after creating the intelligence and senses of the living entities, You inspire them to work hard and enjoy the fruits of their labor. In addition, by Your mercy You awaken their ability to pursue the progressive paths of knowledge, mystic yoga and devotional service, allowing them to advance toward You in Your aspects of Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän, respectively. And when jïäna, yoga and bhakti mature, You empower the living beings to directly realize You in each of Your three aspects."
If the Lord were to ask for authoritative evidence to support this statement by the personified Vedas, they humbly reply, "We ourselves are the evidence. On some occasions—such as now, the time of creation—You consort with Your external, Mäyä potency, whereas You are always present with Your internal energy. It is at times such as the present, when Your activity is outwardly manifest, that we, the Vedas, can recognize You in Your play."
Thus endowed with authority by their personal association with the Supreme Lord, the çrutis promulgate the processes of karma, jïäna, yoga and bhakti as various means for the conditioned souls to employ their intelligence, senses, mind and vitality in search of the Absolute Truth.
In many places the Vedas glorify the transcendental, personal qualities of the Supreme. The following verse appears in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.11), the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad (Uttara 97), and the Brahma Upaniñad (4.1):
eko devaù sarva-bhüteñu güòhaù
sarva-vyäpé sarva-bhütäntarätmä
karmädhyakñaù sarva-bhütädhiväsaù
säkñé cetäù kevalo nirguëaç ca
"The one Supreme Lord lives hidden inside all created things. He pervades all matter and sits within the hearts of all living beings. As the indwelling Supersoul, He supervises their material activities. Thus, while having no material qualities Himself, He is the unique witness and giver of consciousness."
The Supreme's personal qualities are further described in the following quotations from the Upaniñads: Yaù sarva-jïaù sa sarva-vid yasya jïäna-mayaà tapaù. "He who is all-knowing, from whom the potency of all knowledge comes—He is the wisest of all" (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.1.9); sarvasya vaçé sarvasyeçänaù: "He is the Lord and controller of everyone" (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 4.4.22); and yaù påthivyäà tiñöhan påthivyä äntaro yaà påthivé na veda: "He who resides within the earth and pervades it, whom the earth does not know." (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 3.7.3)
The Lord's role in creation is mentioned in many statements of the çruti. The Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (1.2.4) states, so 'kämayata bahu syäm: "He desired, 'I will become many.' " "The phrase so 'kämayata ("He desired") here implies that the Lord's personality is eternal, for even prior to the creation the Absolute Truth experienced desire, and desire is an attribute unique to persons. The Aitareya Upaniñad (3.11) similarly states, sa aikñata tat-tejo 'såjata: "He saw, and His power sent forth the creation." Here the word tat-tejaù refers to the Lord's partial expansion Mahä-Viñëu, who glances upon Mäyä and thus manifests the material creation. Or tat-tejaù may refer to the Lord's impersonal Brahman feature, His potency of all-pervasive, eternal existence. As described in Çré Brahma-saàhitä (5.40),
yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi-
koöiñv açeña-vasudhädi-vibhüti-bhinnam
tad brahma niñkalam anantam açeña-bhütaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes."
In summing up this verse, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
jaya jayäjita jahy aga-jaìgamä-
våtim ajäm upanéta-måñä-guëäm
na hi bhavantam åte prabhavanty amé
nigama-géta-guëärëavatä tava
"All glories, all glories to You, O unconquerable one! Please defeat the influence of Your eternal Mäyä, who covers all moving and nonmoving creatures and who rules over the modes of illusion. Without Your influence, all these Vedic mantras would be powerless to sing of You as the ocean of transcendental qualities."

båhat—as the Supreme; upalabdham—perceived; etat—this (world); avayanti—they consider; avaçeñatayä—in terms of its being the all-pervading foundation of existence; yataù—since; udaya—the generation; astamayau—and dissolution; vikåteù—of a transformation; mådi—of clay; vä—as if; avikåtät—(the Supreme itself) not being subject to transformation; ataù—therefore; åñayaù—the sages (who compiled the Vedic mantras); dadhuù—placed; tvayi—in You; manaù—their minds; vacana—words; äcaritam—and actions; katham—how; ayathä—not as they are; bhavanti—become; bhuvi—upon the ground; datta—placed; padäni—the steps; nåëäm—of men.
This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence, remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all, how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?
There may be some doubt as to whether the Vedic mantras are unanimous when identifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After all, some mantras state, indro yäto 'vasitasya räjä: "Indra is the king of all moving and nonmoving beings" (Åg Veda 1.32.15), while others say, agnir mürdhä divaù: "Agni is the chief of the heavens," and yet other mantras point to different deities as the Absolute. It would seem, then, that the Vedas present a polytheistic world view.
Answering this doubt, the Vedas themselves explain in this verse that there can be only one source of universal creation, called Brahman or Båhat, "the greatest," which is the singular truth underlying and pervading all existence. No finite deity like Indra or Agni can fulfill this unique role, nor would the çrutis be so ignorant as to propose such an idea. As indicated here by the word tvayi, Lord Viñëu alone is the Absolute Truth. Indra and other demigods may be glorified in various ways, but they possess only those powers Lord Çré Viñëu has granted them.
The Vedic sages understand that this entire world—including Indra, Agni, and everything else perceivable by the eyes, ears and other senses—is identical with the one Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead, who is called Båhat, "the greatest," because He is avaçeña, "the ultimate substance that remains." From the Lord everything expands at creation, and into Him everything dissolves at annihilation. He exists before and after the material manifestation as the constant basis, known to philosophers as the "ingredient cause," upädäna. Despite the fact that countless manifestations emanate from Him, the Supreme Lord exists eternally unchanged—an idea the çrutis specifically emphasize here with the word avikåtät.
The words mådi vä ("as in the case of clay") allude to a famous analogy spoken by Udälaka to his son Çvetaketu in the Chändogya Upaniñad (6.4.1): väcärambhanaà vikäro nämadheyaà måttikety eva satyam. "The objects of the material world exist merely as names, transformations defined by language, whereas the ingredient cause, like the clay from which pots are made, is the actual reality." A mass of clay is the ingredient cause of various pots, statues and so on, but the clay itself remains in its essence unchanged. Eventually, the pots and other objects will be destroyed and return to the clay from which they came. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the total ingredient cause, yet He remains eternally untouched by transformation. This is the purport of the statement sarvaà khalv idaà brahma: "Everything is Brahman." (Chändogya Upaniñad 3.14.1) Wondering at this mystery, the great devotee Gajendra prayed,
namo namas te 'khila-käraëäya
niñkäraëäyädbhuta-käraëäya
"Obeisances again and again to You, the source of all creation. You are the inconceivable cause of all causes, and of You there is no other cause." (SB 8.3.15)
Prakåti, material nature, is often considered the ingredient cause of creation, in Western science as well as in the Vedas. This does not contradict the higher fact of the Supreme Lord's being the final cause, since prakåti is His energy, and is herself subject to change. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.24.19), Lord Kåñëa says,
prakåtir yasyopädänam
ädhäraù puruñaù paraù
sato 'bhivyaïjakaù kälo
brahma tat tritayaà tv aham
"The material universe is real, having prakåti as its original ingredient and final state. Lord Mahä-Viñëu is the resting place of nature, which becomes manifest by the power of time. Thus nature, the almighty Viñëu and time are not different from Me, the Supreme Absolute Truth." Prakåti, however, undergoes transformation, while her Lord, the supreme puruña, does not. Prakåti is the Personality of Godhead's external energy, but He has another energy—His internal energy—which is svarüpa-bhütä, nondifferent from His very essence. The Lord's internal energy, like Himself, is never subject to material change.
Therefore the mantras of the Vedas, along with the åñis who have received these mantras in meditation and transmitted them for the benefit of mankind, direct their attention primarily toward the Personality of Godhead. The Vedic sages direct the activities of their mind and words—that is to say, the inner as well as the literal meaning (abhidhä-våtti) of their utterances—first of all toward Him, and only secondarily toward separated transformations of prakåti, such as Indra and other demigods.
Just as a man's footsteps, whether placed on mud, stone or bricks, cannot fail to touch the surface of the earth, so whatever the Vedas discuss within the realm of material generation, they relate to the Absolute Truth. Mundane literature describes limited phenomena, disregarding the relation of its subjects to the total reality, but the Vedas always focus their perfect vision on the Supreme. As the Chändogya Upaniñad affirms in its statements måttikety eva satyam and sarvaà khalv idaà brahma, reality is understood properly when everything is seen to be dependent on Brahman, the Absolute, for its existence. Brahman alone is real, not because nothing we see in this world is real, but because Brahman is the absolute, final cause of everything. Thus the word satyam, as used in the phrase måttikety eva satyam, has been defined in another context as "ingredient cause" by no less an authority than Lord Kåñëa Himself:
yad upädäya pürvas tu
bhävo vikurute param
ädir anto yadä yasya
tat satyam abhidhéyate
"A material object, itself composed of an essential ingredient, creates another material object through transformation. In this way one created object becomes the cause and basis of another created object. A particular thing may be called real in that it possesses the basic nature of another object that constitutes its cause and original state." (SB 11.24.18)
Explaining the word Brahman, Çréla Prabhupäda writes in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, "The word 'Brahman' indicates the greatest of all and the maintainer of everything. The impersonalists are attracted by the greatness of the sky, but because of their poor fund of knowledge they are not attracted by the greatness of Kåñëa. In our practical life, however, we are attracted by the greatness of a person and not by the greatness of a big mountain. Thus the term 'Brahman' actually applies to Kåñëa only; therefore in the Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna concluded that Lord Kåñëa is the Para-brahman, or the supreme resting place of everything.
"Kåñëa is the Supreme Brahman because of His unlimited knowledge, unlimited potencies, unlimited strength, unlimited influence, unlimited beauty and unlimited renunciation. Ultimately, therefore, the word 'Brahman' can be applied to Kåñëa only. Arjuna affirms that because the impersonal Brahman is the effulgence emanating as rays of Kåñëa's transcendental body, Kåñëa is the Para-brahman. Everything rests on Brahman, but Brahman itself rests on Kåñëa. Therefore Kåñëa is the ultimate Brahman, or Para-brahman. The material elements are accepted as the inferior energy of Kåñëa. By their interaction the cosmic manifestation takes place, rests on Kåñëa, and after dissolution again enters into the body of Kåñëa as His subtle energy. Kåñëa is therefore the cause of both manifestation and dissolution."
In summary, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
druhiëa-vahni-ravéndra-mukhämarä

"The demigods, headed by Çiva, Agni, Sürya and Indra, and indeed all beings in the universe, do not come into existence independently of You. The mantras of the Vedas, though they speak from various viewpoints, all speak about You, the unborn Lord appearing in numerous forms."

iti—thus; tava—Your; sürayaù—wise saints; tri—of the three (planetary systems of the universe, or the three modes of nature); adhipate—O master; akhila—of all; loka—the worlds; mala—the contamination; kñapaëa—which eradicates; kathä—of discussions; amåta—nectar; abdhim—into the ocean; avagähya—by diving deeply; tapäàsi—their troubles; jahuù—have given up; kim uta—what to speak; punaù—moreover; sva—their own; dhäma—by the power; vidhuta—dispelled; äçaya—of their minds; käla—and of time; guëäù—the (undesirable) qualities; parama—O supreme one; bhajanti—worship; ye—who; padam—Your true nature; ajasra—uninterrupted; sukha—of happiness; anubhavam—(in which there is) experience.
Therefore, O master of the three worlds, the wise get rid of all misery by diving deep into the nectarean ocean of topics about You, which washes away all the contamination of the universe. Then what to speak of those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature, O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?
According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, in the previous verse those çrutis whose presentation of the Supreme Truth may seem impersonal clarified their true purpose. Now, in the present verse, those who focus exclusively on the divine Personality of Godhead, who speak of His transcendental pastimes, take their turn in praising Him.
Because all the Vedas declare the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes, discriminating persons should take to His worship. By diving into the ocean of His glories, intelligent devotees help dispel the distress of all souls and loosen their own burning attachment to materialistic life. These advancing devotees gradually give up all material attachment and lose any interest they once had in the troublesome austerities of karma, jïäna and yoga.
Beyond these devotees are the süris, connoisseurs of spiritual truth, who honor the nectarean ocean of the Supreme Lord's glories by immersing themselves fully within it. These mature devotees of the Supreme Lord achieve unimaginable perfection. The Lord, reciprocating their sincere endeavors, empowers them to realize Him in His personal form. Remembering with rapture the Lord's intimate pastimes and entourage, they are automatically freed from the last subtle traces of mental contamination and from sensitivity to the unavoidable pains of disease and old age.
Referring to the purifying power of devotional service, the çrutis say, tad yathä puñkara-paläça äpo na çliñyante evam evaà-vidi päpaà karma na çliñyate: "Just as water does not adhere to a lotus leaf, so sinful activities do not adhere to one who knows the truth in this way." The Çatapatha Brähmaëa (14.7.28), Taittiréya Brähmaëa (3.12.9.8), Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.28) and Baudhäyana-dharma-çästra (2.6.11.30) all concur: na karmaëä lipyate päpakena. "One thus avoids becoming tainted by sinful activity."
The Åg Veda (1.154.1) refers to the Supreme Lord's pastimes as follows: viñëor nu kaà véryäëi pravocaà yaù pärthiväni vimame rajäàsi. "Only he may fully enunciate the heroic deeds of Lord Viñëu who can count all the particles of dust in the world." Many çruti-mantras glorify devotional service to the Lord, such as eko vaçé sarva-go ye 'nubhajanti dhéräs/ teñäà sukhaà çäçvataà netareñäm: "He is the one omnipresent Lord and controller; only those wise souls who worship Him obtain eternal happiness, not anyone else."
In this connection Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
sakala-veda-gaëerita-sad-guëas

"Because all the Vedas describe Your transcendental qualities, all thoughtful persons are attracted to hearing and chanting about Your all-auspicious qualities. Thus by remembering Your lotus feet, they are freed from material distress."

Only if they become Your faithful followers are those who breathe actually alive; otherwise their breathing is like that of a bellows. It is by Your mercy alone that the elements, beginning with the mahat-tattva and false ego, created the egg of this universe. Among the manifestations known as anna-maya and so forth, You are the ultimate one, entering within the material coverings along with the living entity and assuming the same forms as those he takes. Distinct from the gross and subtle material manifestations, You are the reality underlying them all.
Life is without purpose for one who remains ignorant of his most well-wishing benefactor and thus fails to worship Him. Such a person's breathing is no better than the breathing of a blacksmith's bellows. The gift of human life is a fortunate opportunity for the conditioned soul, but by turning away from his Lord, the living being commits spiritual suicide.
In the words of Çré Éçopaniñad (3),
asuryä näma te lokä
andhena tamasävåtäù
täàs te pretyäbhigacchanti
ye ke cätma-hano janäù
"The killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance." Asuryäù means "to be obtained by demons," and demons are persons who have no devotion for the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. This definition is stated in the Agni Puräëa:
dvau bhüta-sargau loke 'smin
daiva äsura eva ca
viñëu-bhakti-paro daiva
äsuras tad-viparyayaù
 [Bg. 16.6]
"There are two kinds of created beings in this world, godly and demoniac. Those dedicated to the devotional service of Lord Viñëu are godly, and those opposed to such service are demoniac."
Similarly, the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.15) states, na ced avedén mahaté vinañöiù . . . ye tad vidur amåtäs te bhavanty athetare duùkham evopayanti: "If one does not come to know the Supreme, he must suffer utter destruction.... Those who realize the Supreme become immortal, but others inevitably suffer." A person must revive his Kåñëa consciousness to be relieved of the suffering caused by ignorance, but the process by which this is done need not be difficult, as Lord Kåñëa assures us in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.34):
man-manä bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru
mäm evaiñyasi yuktvaivam
ätmänaà mat-paräyaëaù
"Engage your mind in always thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me." Despite disqualifications and weaknesses, one need only willingly become anuvidha, the Supreme Lord's trusting and trustworthy servant. The Kaöha Upaniñad (2.2.13) proclaims,
nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm
eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän
taà péöha-gaà ye 'nupaçyanti dhéräs
teñäà çäntiù çäçvaté netareñäm
"Among all the eternal, conscious beings, there is one who supplies the needs of everyone else. The wise souls who worship Him in His abode attain everlasting peace. Others cannot."
What is alive, and what is dead? The bodies and minds of materialistic nondevotees seem to display the symptoms of life, but this appearance is deceptive. Actually, the conditioned soul has little control over his own bodily existence. Against his will, he has to excrete waste, get sick from time to time, and eventually age and die. And in his mind he unwillingly suffers anger, hankering and lamentation. Lord Kåñëa describes this situation as yanträrüòhäni mäyayä (Bg. 18.61), riding helplessly as a passenger in a mechanical vehicle. The soul undoubtedly is alive, and irrevocably so, but in his ignorance that inner life is covered and forgotten. In its place, the automation of the external mind and body carries out the dictates of the modes of nature, which force one to act in a way altogether irrelevant to the dormant needs of the soul. Calling out to the forgetful prisoners of illusion, the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (2.5) urges,
çåëvantu viçve amåtasya puträ
ä ye dhämäni divyäni tasthuù
"All you sons of immortality, hear, you who once resided in the divine kingdom!"
So, on the one hand, what is normally viewed as living—the material body—is in actuality a dead machine being manipulated by the modes of nature. And on the other hand, what the materialist condescendingly views as inert matter meant for exploitation is in its unknown essence connected with a living intelligence vastly more potent than his own. The Vedic civilization recognizes the intelligence behind nature as belonging to demigods who preside over the various elements, and ultimately to the Supreme Lord Himself. Matter, after all, cannot act coherently without the impulse and guidance of a living force. As Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.10),
mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù
süyate sa-caräcaram
hetunänena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
"This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kunté, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again."
In the beginning of creation, Lord Mahä-Viñëu glanced at the dormant material nature, prakåti. Thus awakened, the subtle prakåti began to evolve into more concrete forms: first the mahat; then false ego in conjunction with each of prakåti's three modes; and gradually the various material elements, including intelligence, mind, the senses and the five physical elements with their presiding demigods. Even after becoming separately manifested, however, the deities responsible for the various elements could not work together to produce the perceptible world until Lord Viñëu, by His special mercy, once more intervened. This is described in the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.5.38-39):
ete deväù kalä viñëoù
käla-mäyäàça-liìginaù
nänätvät sva-kriyänéçäù
procuù präïjalayo vibhum
devä ücuù
nanäma te deva padäravindaà
prapanna-täpopaçamätapatram
yan-müla-ketä yatayo 'ïjasoru-
saàsära-duùkhaà bahir utkñipanti
"The controlling deities of these physical elements are empowered expansions of Lord Viñëu. They are embodied by eternal time under the external energy, and they are His parts and parcels. Because they were entrusted with different functions of universal duties but were unable to perform them, they offered fascinating prayers to the Lord. The demigods said, 'O Lord, Your lotus feet are like an umbrella for the surrendered souls, protecting them from all the miseries of material existence. All the sages under that shelter throw off all material miseries. We therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet.'"
Hearing the prayers of the assembled demigods of the elements, the Supreme Lord then showed His favor (SB 3.6.1-3):
iti täsäà sva-çakténäà
saténäm asametya saù
prasupta-loka-tanträëäà
niçämya gatim éçvaraù
käla-saàjïäà tadä devéà
bibhrac chaktim urukramaù
trayoviàçati tattvänäà
gaëaà yugapad äviçat
so 'nupraviñöo bhagaväàç
ceñöä-rüpeëa taà gaëam
bhinnaà saàyojayäm äsa
suptaà karma prabodhayan
"The Lord thus heard about the suspension of the progressive creative functions of the universe due to the noncombination of His potencies, such as the mahat-tattva. The Supreme Powerful Lord then simultaneously entered into the twenty-three elements with the goddess Kälé, His external energy, who alone amalgamates all the different elements. Thus when the Personality of Godhead entered into the elements by His energy, all the living entities were enlivened into different activities, just as one is engaged in his work after awakening from sleep."
In Kåñëa, Çréla Prabhupäda explains the five levels of ego covering the self: "Within the body there are five different departments of existence, known as anna-maya, präëa-maya, mano-maya, vijïäna-maya and, at last, änanda-maya. In the beginning of life, every living entity is food conscious. A child or an animal is satisfied only by getting nice food. This stage of consciousness, in which the goal is to eat sumptuously, is called anna-maya. Anna means "food." After this one lives in the consciousness of being alive. If one can continue his life without being attacked or destroyed, one thinks himself happy. This stage is called präëa-maya, or consciousness of one's existence. After this stage, when one is situated on the mental platform, his consciousness is called mano-maya. The materialistic civilization is primarily situated in these three stages, anna-maya, präëa-maya and mano-maya. The first concern of civilized persons is economic development, the next concern is defense against being annihilated, and the next consciousness is mental speculation, the philosophical approach to the values of life.
"If by the evolutionary process of philosophical life one happens to reach the platform of intellectual life and understands that he is not this material body but a spiritual soul, he is situated in the vijïäna-maya stage. Then, by evolution in spiritual life, he comes to the understanding of the Supreme Lord, or the Supreme Soul. When one develops his relationship with Him and executes devotional service, that stage of life is called Kåñëa consciousness, the änanda-maya stage. Änanda-maya is the blissful life of knowledge and eternity. As it is said in the Vedänta-sütra, änanda-mayo 'bhyäsät. The Supreme Brahman and the subordinate Brahman, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities, are both joyful by nature. As long as the living entities are situated in the lower four stages of life—anna-maya, präëa-maya, mano-maya and vijïäna-maya—they are considered to be in the material condition of life, but as soon as one reaches the stage of änanda-maya, he is a liberated soul. This änanda-maya stage is explained in the Bhagavad-gétä as the brahma-bhüta stage. There it is said that in the brahma-bhüta stage of life there is no anxiety and no hankering. This stage begins when one is equally disposed toward all living entities, and it then expands to the stage of Kåñëa consciousness, in which one always hankers to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This hankering for advancement in devotional service is not the same as hankering for sense gratification in material existence. In other words, hankering remains in spiritual life, but it becomes purified. Similarly, when our senses are purified, they are freed from all material stages, namely anna-maya, präëa-maya, mano-maya and vijïäna-maya, and they become situated in the highest stage—änanda-maya, or blissful life in Kåñëa consciousness. The Mäyävädé philosophers consider änanda-maya to be the state of being merged in the Supreme. To them, änanda-maya means that the Supersoul and the individual soul become one. But the real fact is that oneness does not mean merging into the Supreme and losing one's own individual existence. Merging into the spiritual existence is the living entity's realization of qualitative oneness with the Supreme Lord in His aspects of eternity and knowledge. But the actual änanda-maya (blissful) stage is attained when one is engaged in devotional service. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä: mad-bhaktià labhate paräm [Bg. 18.54]. Here Lord Kåñëa states that the brahma-bhüta änanda-maya stage is complete only when there is an exchange of love between the Supreme and the subordinate living entities. Unless one comes to this änanda-maya stage, his breathing is like the breathing of a bellows in a blacksmith's shop, his duration of life is like that of a tree, and he is no better than the lower animals like the camels, hogs and dogs."
In accompanying the jéva within the coverings of Mäyä, the Paramätmä is not bound by karmic entanglement as the jéva is. Rather, the Supreme Soul's connection with these coverings is like the apparent connection between the moon and some tree branches it is seen through. The Supersoul is sad-asataù param, always transcendental to the subtle and gross manifestations of anna-maya and so on, although He enters among them as the sanctioning witness of all activities. As their final cause, the Supersoul is in one sense identical with the manifest products of creation, but in His original identity (svarüpa) He remains distinct. In this second sense He is the änanda-maya alone, the last of the five koças. Therefore the çrutis address Him here as avaçeñam, the residual essence. This is also expressed in the text of the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.7): raso vai saù. Within His personal essence, the Supreme Lord enjoys rasa, the reciprocation of the mellows of devotional service, and integral to the play of rasas is the participation of realized jévas. Raso vai saù, rasam hy eväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati: "He is the embodiment of rasa, and the jéva who realizes this rasa becomes fully ecstatic." Or in the words of the personified Vedas praying in this verse, the Supersoul is åtam, which Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté interprets as here meaning "realized by great sages."
In the opinion of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the last word of all authoritative scripture (sarväntima-çruti) is contained in the aphorism raso vai saù, which is demonstrably a reference to Lord Çré Kåñëa as the infinitely expanding embodiment of divine pleasure (sarva-båhattamänanda). The Gopäla-täpané çruti (Uttara 96) states, yo 'sau jägrat-svapna-suñuptim atétya turyätéto gopälaù: "Lord Kåñëa, the cowherd, transcends not only the material consciousness of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep, but also the fourth realm of pure, spiritual awareness." The änanda-maya Supersoul is simply an aspect of the primeval Lord Govinda, as declared by Him, viñöabhyäham idaà kåtsnam ekäàçena sthito jagat: "With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe." (Bg. 10.42)
The çrutis thus tactfully assert that even among the various personal forms of Godhead, Kåñëa is supreme. Understanding this, Närada Muni will later offer obeisances to Lord Kåñëa in the words namas tasmai bhagavate kåñëäyämala-kértaye (Text 46), even though He is standing in front of Lord Näräyaëa Åñi.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé concludes his comments on this verse by praying,
nara-vapuù pratipädya yadi tvayi
çravaëa-varëana-saàsmaraëädibhiù
nara-hare na bhajanti nåëäm idaà
dåti-vad ucchvasitaà viphalaà tataù
"O Lord Narahari, persons who have attained this human form live uselessly, merely breathing like bellows, if they fail to worship You by hearing about You, chanting Your glories, remembering You and performing the other devotional practices."

udaram—the abdomen; upäsate—worship; ye—who; åñi—of sages; vartmasu—according to the standard methods; kürpa—gross; dåçaù—their vision; parisara—from which all the präëic channels emanate; paddhatim—the node; hådayam—the heart; äruëayaù—the Äruëi sages; daharam—subtle; tataù—thence; udagät—(the soul) rises up; ananta—O unlimited Lord; tava—Your; dhäma—place of appearance; çiraù—to the head; paramam—the highest destination; punaù—again; iha—into this world; yat—which; sametya—reaching; na patanti—they do not fall down; kåta-anta—of death; mukhe—into the mouth.
Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of the abdomen, while the Äruëis worship Him as present in the heart, in the subtle center from which all the präëic channels emanate. From there, O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then, passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world, into the mouth of death.
Here the çrutis who teach meditational yoga glorify the Personality of Godhead. The various processes of yoga are for the most part gradual and full of opportunities for distraction. Authentic methods of yoga, nonetheless, all aim at meditation on the Supersoul (Paramätmä), whose primary residence is in the region of the heart, alongside the jéva soul. This manifestation of Paramätmä in the heart is very subtle and difficult to perceive (daharam), and thus only advanced yogés can realize Him there.
Neophyte meditators often practice focusing on the Supersoul's secondary presence in one of the lower centers of vital energy, such as the mülädhära-cakra, at the base of the spine, the svädhiñöhäna-cakra, in the area of the navel, or the maëipüra-cakra, in the abdomen. Lord Kåñëa refers to His expansion as Paramätmä in the abdominal cakra as follows:
ahaà vaiçvänaro bhütvä
präëinaà deham ästhitaù
präëäpäna-samäyuktaù
pacämy annaà catur-vidham
"I am the fire of digestion in the bodies of all living entities, and I join with the air of life, outgoing and incoming, to digest the four kinds of food." (Bg. 15.14) Lord Vaiçvänara presides over digestion and in general bestows the capacity of mobility on animals, humans and demigods. In the judgment of the çrutis speaking this verse, those who limit their meditation to this form of the Lord are less intelligent, kürpa-dåçaù, meaning literally "having eyes clouded by dust."
The superior yogés known as Äruëis, on the other hand, worship the Supersoul in His form as the indwelling companion of the jéva in the heart, the Lord who endows His dependent with the power of knowledge and inspires him with all varieties of practical intelligence. And just as the physical heart is the center of blood circulation, so the subtle heart-cakra is the crossroads of numerous channels of präëa, called näòés, which extend outward to all parts of the body. When these passageways have been sufficiently purified, the Äruëi yogés can leave the heart region and go upward to the cakra at the roof of the brain. Yogés who leave their bodies through this cakra, the brahma-randhra, go directly to the kingdom of God, from which they need never return to be reborn. Thus even the unsure process of meditational yoga can bear the fruit of pure devotion if it is followed perfectly.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura cites several çruti-mantras that echo the words of this verse: udaraà brahmeti çärkaräkñä upäsate hådayaà brahmeti äruëayo brahmä haivaitä ita ürdhvaà tv evodasarpat tac-chiro 'çrayate. "Those whose vision is clouded identify Brahman with the abdomen, while the Äruëis worship Brahman in the heart. One who is truly Brahman-realized travels upward from the heart to take shelter of the Lord who is manifested at the top of the head."
çataà caikä ca hådayasya näòyas
täsäà mürdhänam abhiniùsåtaikä
tayordhvam äyann amåtatvam eti
viçvaìì anyä utkramaëe bhavanti
"There are one hundred and one subtle präëic channels emanating from the heart. One of these—the suñumëä—extends to the top of the head. By passing up through this channel, one transcends death. The other channels lead in all directions, to various kinds of rebirth." (Chändogya Upaniñad 8.6.6)
The Upaniñads refer repeatedly to the indwelling Paramätmä. Çré Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.12-13) describes Him as follows:
mahän prabhur vai puruñaù
sattvasyaiña pravartakaù
su-nirmaläà imäà präptim
éçäno jyotir avyayaù
aìguñöha-mätraù puruño 'ntar-ätmä
sadä janänäà hådaye sanniviñöaù
hådä manéñä manasäbhikÿpto
ya etad vidur amåtäs te bhavanti
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes the Puruña to initiate the expansion of this cosmos. He is the perfectly pure goal that yogés strive to reach, the effulgent and infallible ultimate controller. Measuring the size of a thumb, the Puruña is always present as the Supersoul within the hearts of all living beings. By exercising proper intelligence, one can realize Him within the heart; those who learn this method will gain immortality."
In conclusion, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
udarädiñu yaù puàsäà
cintito muni-vartmabhiù
hanti måtyu-bhayam devo
håd-gataà tam upäsmahe
"Let us worship the Supreme Lord, who resides in the heart. When mortal beings think of Him by the standard procedures established by great sages, meditating upon Him in His expansions in the abdomen and other regions of the body, the Lord reciprocates by destroying all fear of death."

Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among all these impermanent life forms.
Hearing these prayers of the personified Vedas, in which the çrutis describe the Supersoul as entering countless varieties of material bodies, a critic may question how the Supreme can do this without becoming limited. Indeed, proponents of Advaita philosophy see no essential distinction between the Supreme Soul and His creation. In the impersonalists' conception, the Absolute has inexplicably gotten itself entrapped by illusion and has thus become first a personal God and then the demigods, humans, animals, plants and finally matter. Çaìkaräcärya and his followers take great pains to cite Vedic evidence to support this theory of how illusion is imposed on the Absolute. But speaking for themselves, the Vedas here answer this objection and refuse to lend their authority to Mäyäväda impersonalism.
The process of creation is technically called såñöi, "sending forth." The Supreme Lord sends forth His variegated energies, and these partake of His nature while remaining distinct from Him. This fact is expressed in the true Vedic philosophy of acintya-bhedäbheda, the inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference of the Supreme Lord and His energies. Thus although each of the multitude of individual souls is a distinct entity, all souls consist of the same spiritual substance as the Supreme. Since they partake of the Supreme Lord's spiritual essence, the jévas are unborn and eternal, just as He is. Lord Kåñëa, speaking to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, confirms this:
na tv evähaà jätu näsaà
na tvaà neme janädhipäù
na caiva na bhaviñyämaù
sarve vayam ataù param
"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be." (Bg. 2.12) Material creation is a special arrangement for those jévas who choose to separate themselves from the Supreme Lord's service, and thus the creation involves producing an imitation world where they can try to be independent.
After creating the many species of material life, the Supreme Lord expands into His own creation as the Supersoul in order to provide the intelligence and inspiration every living being needs for his day-to-day existence. As stated in the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.6.2), tat såñövä tad evänupräviçat: "After creating this world, He then entered within it." The Lord enters the material world, however, without forming any binding connection to it; this the çrutis here declare by the phrase viçann iva, "only seeming to enter." Taratamataç cakässi means that the Paramätmä enters the body of every living being, from the great demigod Brahmä down to the insignificant germ, and exhibits differing degrees of His potency according to each soul's capacity for enlightenment. Analavat sva-kåtänukåtiù: Just as fire ignited in several objects burns according to the different forms of those objects, so the Supreme Soul, entering the bodies of all living creatures, illuminates the consciousness of each conditioned soul according to his individual capacity.
Even in the midst of material creation and destruction, the Lord of all creatures remains eternally unchanged, as expressed here by the word eka-rasam. In other words, the Lord eternally maintains His personal form of immeasurable, unalloyed spiritual pleasure. The rare living beings who completely (abhitas) disengage themselves from material dealings, or paëa (thereby becoming abhivipaëyavaù), come to know the Supreme Lord as He is. Every intelligent person should follow the example of these great souls and beg from them the chance to also be engaged in the Supreme Lord's devotional service.
This prayer is recited by çrutis whose mood is similar to that expressed in the following mantra of the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.11):
eko devaù sarva-bhüteñu güòhaù
sarva-vyäpé sarva-bhütäntarätmä
karmädhyakñaù sarva-bhütädhiväsaù
säkñé cetä kevalo nirguëaç ca
"The one Supreme Lord lives hidden inside all created things. He pervades all matter and sits within the hearts of all living beings. As the indwelling Supersoul, He supervises their material activities. Thus, while having no material qualities Himself, He is the unique witness and giver of consciousness."
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé submits his own prayer:
sva-nirmiteñu käryeñu
täratamya-vivarjitam
sarvänusyüta-san-mätraà
bhagavantaà bhajämahe
"Let us worship the Supreme Lord, who enters the products of His own creation yet remains aloof from their superior and inferior material gradations. He is the pure, undifferentiated existence pervading everything."

The individual living entity, while inhabiting the material bodies he has created for himself by his karma, actually remains uncovered by either gross or subtle matter. This is so because, as the Vedas describe, he is part and parcel of You, the possessor of all potencies. Having determined this to be the status of the living entity, learned sages become imbued with faith and worship Your lotus feet, to which all Vedic sacrifices in this world are offered, and which are the source of liberation.
Not only does the Supreme Lord remain totally uncontaminated when He resides within the material bodies of the conditioned souls, but even the infinitesimal jéva souls are never directly touched by the coverings of ignorance and lust they acquire while passing through repeated cycles of birth and death. Thus the Taittiréya Upaniñad (3.10.5) proclaims, sa yaç cäyaà puruñe yaç cäsäv äditye sa ekaù: "The soul of the embodied living being is one with Him who stands within the sun." Similarly, the Chändogya Upaniñad (6.8.7) teaches, tat tvam asi: "You are nondifferent from that Supreme Truth."
In this prayer, the personified Vedas refer to the finite enjoyer of material bodies (the jéva soul) as an expansion of the transcendental reservoir of all potencies, the Supreme Lord. The term aàça-kåtam, "made as His portion," must be properly understood, however, in this context. The jéva is not created at any time, nor is he the same kind of expansion of the Lord as the omnipotent viñëu-tattva expansions. The Supreme Soul is the proper object of all worship, and the subordinate jéva soul is meant to be His worshiper. The Supreme Lord enacts His pastimes by showing Himself in innumerable aspects of His personality, whereas the jéva is forced to change bodies whenever his accumulated karmic reactions so dictate. According to Çré Närada Païcarätra,
yat taöa-sthaà tu cid-rüpaà
sva-saàvedyäd vinirgatam
raïjitaà guëa-rägeëa
sa jéva iti kathyate
"The marginal potency, who is spiritual by nature, who emanates from the self-cognizant saàvit energy, and who becomes tainted by his attachment to the modes of material nature, is called the jéva.''
Although the jéva soul is also an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, he is distinguished from Kåñëa's independent Viñëu expansions by his constitutional position on the margin between spirit and matter. As the Mahä-varäha Puräëa explains,
sväàçaç cätha vibhinnäàça
iti dvidhä sa iñyate
aàçino yat tu sämarthyaà
yat-svarüpaà yathä sthitiù
tad eva näëu-mätro 'pi
bhedaà sväàçäàçinoù kvacit
vibhinnäàço 'lpa-çaktiù syät
kiïcit sämarthya-mätra-yuk
"The Supreme Lord is known in two ways: in terms of His plenary expansions and His separated expansions. Between the plenary expansions and Their source of expansion there is never any essential difference in terms of either Their capabilities, forms or situations. The separated expansions, on the other hand, possess only minute potency, being endowed only to a small extent with the Lord's powers."
The conditioned soul in this world appears as if covered by matter, internally as well as externally. Externally, gross matter surrounds him in the forms of his body and environment, while internally desire and aversion impinge upon his consciousness. But from the transcendental perspective of realized sages, both kinds of material covering are insubstantial. By logically eliminating all material identities, which are misconceptions based on the soul's gross and subtle coverings, a thoughtful person can determine that the soul is nothing material. Rather, he is a pure spark of divine spirit, a servant of the Supreme Godhead. Understanding this, one should worship the Supreme Lord's lotus feet; such worship is the fully bloomed flower of the tree of Vedic rituals. One's realization of the splendor of the Lord's lotus feet, gradually nourished by the offering of Vedic sacrifices, automatically bears the fruits of liberation from material existence and irrevocable faith in the Lord's mercy. One can accomplish all this while still living in the material world. As Lord Kåñëa states in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad (Uttara 47),
mathurä-maëòale yas tu
jambüdvépe sthito 'tha vä
yo 'rcayet pratimäà prati
sa me priyataro bhuvi
"One who worships Me in My Deity form while living in the district of Mathurä or, indeed, anywhere in Jambüdvépa, becomes most dear to Me in this world."
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
tvad-aàçasya mameçäna
tvan-mäyä-kåta-bandhanam
tvad-aìghri-seväm ädiçya

"My Lord, please free me, Your partial expansion, from the bondage created by Your Mäyä. Please do this, O abode of supreme bliss, by directing me to the service of Your feet."

My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet.
Ritualistic brähmaëas (smärtas) and impersonalists (Mäyävädés) always try to relegate the process of bhakti-yoga to a relative or minor role. They say that devotion to the Personality of Godhead is for sentimental persons who lack the maturity to observe strict rituals or pursue the rigorous culture of knowledge.
In this verse, however, the personified Vedas most emphatically declare the superexcellence of devotional service, clearly identifying it with ätma-tattva, the science of the self that impersonalists so proudly claim as their own domain. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé here defines ätma-tattva as the confidential mystery of the Supreme Lord's personal forms, qualities and pastimes. He also gives a second meaning for the phrase ätta-tanoù. Instead of meaning "who assumes various bodies," the phrase can also mean "He who attracts everyone to His transcendental body."
The pastimes of Lord Kåñëa and His various expansions and incarnations are an unfathomable ocean of enjoyment. When a person comes to the point of complete exhaustion in his materialistic pursuits—whether he has been searching after material success or some impersonal notion of spiritual annihilation—he can gain relief by submerging himself in this nectar. As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé explains in his textbook on the science of bhakti-yoga, Çré Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (rendered into English by Çréla Prabhupäda as The Nectar of Devotion), one who tastes even a single drop of this vast ocean will forever lose all desire for anything else.
Giving an alternative interpretation of the word pariçramaëäù, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments that although the devotees of the Lord become fatigued after repeatedly diving into the endless waves and undercurrents in the ocean of the Lord's pleasure pastimes, these devotees never desire any happiness other than the Lord's service, even the happiness of liberation. Rather, their very fatigue becomes pleasure for them, just as the fatigue produced by sex indulgence is pleasurable to those addicted to sex. The Supreme Lord's pure devotees become enthused by hearing the charming narrations of His pastimes and feel impelled to dance, sing, shout out loud, kick their heels together, faint, sob and run about like madmen. Thus they become too absorbed in ecstasy to notice any bodily discomfort.
Pure Vaiñëavas do not want even liberation, what to speak of other desirable goals, such as an exalted position as ruler of the heavenly planets. This degree of exclusive dedication is admittedly only rarely achieved in this world, as the çrutis speaking this verse indicate by the word kecit ("a few"). Not only do pure devotees abandon their hankering for future gain, but they also lose all their attraction for what they already possess—the common comforts of home and family life. The association of saintly Vaiñëavas—the disciplic succession of masters, disciples and granddisciples—becomes for them their real family, filled with swanlike personalities like Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé. These great personalities always drink the sweet nectar of service to the Supreme Lord's lotus feet.
Many mantras of the Upaniñads and other çrutis openly declare devotional service to be superior to liberation itself. In the words of the Nåsiàha-pürva-täpané Upaniñad, yaà sarve vedä namanti mumukñavo brahma-vädinaç ca: "To Him all the Vedas, all seekers of liberation and all students of the Absolute Truth offer their obeisances." Commenting on this mantra, Çré Çaìkaräcärya admits, muktä api lélayä vigrahaà kåtvä bhajanti: "Even liberated souls take pleasure in establishing the Supreme Lord's Deity and worshiping Him." The great rival of Äcärya Çaìkara, Çréla Madhväcärya Änandatértha, cites his own favorite çruti-mantras in this regard, such as muktä hy etam upäsate, muktänäm api bhaktir hi paramänanda-rüpiëé: "Even those who are liberated worship Him, and even for them devotional service is the embodiment of supreme bliss"; and amåtasya dhärä bahudhä dohamänaà/ caraëaà no loke su-dhitäà dadhätu/ oà tat sat: "May His feet, which bountifully pour forth floods of nectar, bestow wisdom upon us who are living in this world."
In summary, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
tvat-kathämåta-päthodhau

kurvanti kåtinaù kecic

"Those rare, fortunate souls who derive great delight by sporting in the nectar ocean of topics about You consider the four great goals of life [religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation] to be no more important than a blade of grass."

When this human body is used for Your devotional service, it acts as one's self, friend and beloved. But unfortunately, although You always show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.
The Vedas have strong words for those who choose to remain in illusion rather than serve the all-merciful Personality of Godhead. The Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.3.15) states, ärämam asya paçyanti na taà paçyati kaçcana. na tam vidätha ya imä jajänänyad yuñmäkam antaram babhüva. néhäreëa prävåtä jalpyä cäsu-tåpa uktha-çäsaç caranti: "Everyone can see the place where the Lord manifested Himself in this world for His own pleasure, but still no one sees Him. None of you know Him who generated all these living beings, and thus there is a great difference between your vision and His. Covered by the fog of illusion, you performers of Vedic rituals indulge in useless talk and live only to gratify your senses."
The Supreme Lord pervades this universe, as He says in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.4), mayä tataà idaà sarvaà jagat. Nothing in this world, not even the most insignificant clay pot or shred of cloth, is devoid of the presence of the Personality of Godhead. But because He keeps Himself invisible to envious eyes (avyakta-mürtinä), materialists are misled by His material energy and think that the source of material creation is a combination of atoms and physical forces.
Displaying their compassion for such foolish materialists, the personified Vedas advise them in this prayer to remember the real purpose for which they exist: to serve the Lord, their greatest well-wisher, with loving devotion. The human body is the ideal facility for reviving one's spiritual consciousness; its organs—ears, tongue, eyes and so on—are quite suitable for hearing about the Lord, chanting His glories, worshiping Him and performing all the other essential aspects of devotional service.
One's material body is destined to remain intact for only a short time, and so it is called kuläyam, subject to "dissolving into the earth" (kau léyate). Nonetheless, if properly utilized it can be one's best friend. When one is immersed in material consciousness, however, the body becomes a false friend, distracting the bewildered living entity from his true self-interest. Persons too much infatuated with their own bodies and those of their spouses, children, pets and so on are in fact misdirecting their devotion to the worship of illusion, asad-upäsanä. In this way, as the çrutis state here, such people commit spiritual suicide, insuring future punishment for failing to carry out the higher responsibilities of human existence. As the Éçopaniñad (3) declares,
asuryä näma te lokä
andhena tamasävåtäù
täàs te pretyäbhigacchanti
ye ke cätma-hano janäù
"The killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance."
Those who are overly attached to sense gratification, or who worship the impermanent in the form of false, materialistic scriptures and philosophies, maintain desires that carry them into more degraded bodies in each successive life. Since they are entrapped in the perpetually rotating cycle of saàsära, their only hope for salvation is getting a chance to hear the merciful instructions spoken by the Supreme Lord's devotees.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,

Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we çrutis, who generally see You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts in the same way.
According to Äcärya Çré Jéva Gosvämé, the few çrutis—such as the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad—who identify the cowherd boy Kåñëa with absolute Brahman in its highest aspect had so far been patiently waiting for their turn to speak. But after hearing the other çrutis offer prayers openly glorifying the Lord's personality, these intimate çrutis could no longer contain themselves, and so they spoke out of turn in this verse.
Followers of the path of mystic yoga subdue their senses and minds by practicing breath control and severe austerities. If they succeed in thoroughly purifying themselves by this regimen, they may eventually begin to realize the Paramätmä, the personal form of Brahman within the heart. And if they continue this meditation without deviation for a long time, they may in the end come to the point of true God consciousness. But the same objective achieved in this difficult and uncertain way was also attained by the demons who were killed by Lord Kåñëa during His pastimes on the earth. Obsessed with enmity toward Him, demons like Kaàsa and Çiçupäla quickly obtained the perfection of liberation simply by His killing them.
Speaking for themselves, however, the personified Vedas here state that they would prefer to develop love of Godhead by learning to emulate the favorable surrender of Lord Kåñëa's confidential devotees, especially the young gopés of Vraja. Though they appeared to be simple women attracted conjugally to the Lord's physical beauty and strength, the goddesses of Vraja exhibited the highest perfection of meditation. The çrutis wish to become just like them.
In this regard, Lord Brahmä relates the following historical account in the supplement to the Båhad-vämana Puräëa:
brahmänanda-mayo loko

"Lord Brahmä said: After hearing these words, the çrutis meditated on the Personality of Godhead's beauty for a long time. When the designated time ultimately arrived, they became gopés and obtained the association of Kåñëa."
A similar account can be found in the Såñöi-khaëòa of the Padma Puräëa, which describes how the Gäyatré mantra also became a gopé.
Regarding the development of bhakti, Lord Kåñëa further states in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad (Uttara 4), apütaù püto bhavati yaà mäà småtvä, avraté vraté bhavati yaà mäà småtvä, niñkämaù sa-kämo bhavati yaà mäà småtvä, açrotré çrotré bhavati yaà mäà småtvä: "By remembering Me, one who is impure becomes pure. By remembering Me, one who follows no vows becomes a strict follower of vows. By remembering Me, one who is desireless develops desires [to serve Me]. By remembering Me, one who has studied no Vedic mantras becomes an expert knower of the Vedas."
The Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.5.6) refers to the gradual steps in the process of becoming Kåñëa conscious: ätmä vä are drañöavyaù çrotavyo mantavyo nididhyäsitavyaù. "It is the Self which must be observed, heard about, thought of and meditated upon with fixed concentration." The idea here is that one should realize the Supreme Self as directly visible in His full personality by the following means: First one should hear the instructions of a qualified representative of the Paramätmä and take the words of such a spiritual master into one's heart by offering him humble service and striving in all ways to please him. One should then ponder the divine message of the spiritual master continuously, with the aim of dispelling all one's doubts and misconceptions. Then one can proceed to meditate on the Supreme Lord's lotus feet with total conviction and determination.
So-called jïänés may think that the Upaniñads praise nirviçeña (impersonal) realization of the Supreme as more complete and final than sa-viçeña (personal) worship of the Supreme Godhead. All honest Vaiñëavas, however, join in adhering to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, always meditating with pleasure on His infinitely wonderful, variegated spiritual qualities. In the words of the çruti-mantras, yam evaiña våëute tena labhyas/ tasyaiña ätmä vivåëute tanüà sväm: "To that person whom the Supreme Soul chooses, He becomes attainable. To that person the Supreme Soul reveals His personal form." (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.2.23 and Muëòaka Upaniñad 3.2.3)
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé concludes with the prayer,
caraëa-smaraëaà premëä
tava deva su-durlabham
yathä kathaïcid nå-hare
mama bhüyäd ahar-niçam
"O Lord, loving remembrance of Your lotus feet is very rarely achieved. Please, O Nåhari, somehow arrange for me to have that remembrance day and night."

Everyone in this world has recently been born and will soon die. So how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahmä, and all subsequent demigods, both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything within Himself, nothing else remains—no gross or subtle matter or bodies composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.
Here the çrutis express the difficulty of knowing the Supreme. Devotional service, or bhakti-yoga, as described in these prayers of the personified Vedas, is the surest and easiest path to knowledge of the Lord and to liberation. In comparison, the philosophic search for knowledge, known as jïäna-yoga, is very difficult, favored though it is by those who are disgusted with material life but still unwilling to surrender to the Lord. As long as the finite soul remains envious of the Lord's supremacy, the Lord does not reveal Himself. As He states in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.25),
nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya
yoga-mäyä-samävåtaù
müdho 'yaà näbhijänäti
loko mäm ajam avyayam
"I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible." And in the words of Lord Brahmä,
panthäs tu koöi-çata-vatsara-sampragamyo
väyor athäpi manaso muni-puìgavänäm
so 'py asti yat-prapada-sémny avicintya-tattve
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, only the tip of the toe of whose lotus feet is approached by the yogés, who aspire after the transcendental and betake themselves to präëäyäma by drilling the respiration; or by the jïänés, who search out the undifferentiated Brahman by the process of elimination of the mundane, extending over thousands of millions of years." (Bs. 5.34)
Brahmä, the first-born living being in this universe, is also the foremost sage. He is born from Lord Näräyaëa, and from him appear the hosts of demigods, including both the controllers of earthly activities and the rulers of heaven. All these powerful and intelligent beings are relatively recent productions of the Lord's creative energy. As the first speaker of the Vedas, Lord Brahmä should know their purport at least as well as any other authority, but even he knows the Personality of Godhead only to a limited extent. As Çrémad-Bhägavatam states (1.3.35), veda-guhyäni håt-pateù: "The Lord of the heart hides Himself deep within the confidential recesses of the Vedic sound." If Brahmä and the demigods born from him cannot easily know the Supreme Lord, how then can mere mortals expect success in their independent pursuit of knowledge?
As long as this creation lasts, living beings face many obstacles on the path of knowledge. Because of identifying themselves with their material coverings, consisting of body, mind and ego, they acquire all sorts of prejudices and misconceptions. Even if they have the divine scripture to guide them and the opportunity to execute the prescribed methods of karma, jïäna and yoga, the conditioned souls have but little power for gaining knowledge of the Absolute. And when the time of annihilation comes, the Vedic scriptures and their regulative injunctions become unmanifest, leaving the dormant jévas completely in darkness. Therefore we should abandon our futile endeavors for knowledge without devotion and simply surrender ourselves to the Supreme Lord's mercy, heeding the advice of Lord Brahmä:
jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta eva
jévanti san-mukharitäà bhavadéya-värtäm
sthäne sthitäù çruti-gataà tanu-väì-manobhiù
ye präyaço jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyäm
"Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds." (SB 10.14.3)
In this regard, the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.4.1) refers to the Supreme as yato väco nivartante apräpya manasä saha, "where words cease, and where the mind cannot reach." The Éçopaniñad (4) states,
anejad ekaà manaso javéyo
naitad devä äpnuvan pürvam arçat
tad dhävato 'nyän atyeti tiñöhat
tasmin apo mätariçvä dadhäti
"Although fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is more swift than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He controls those who supply the air and rain. He surpasses all in excellence." And in the Åg Veda (3.54.5) we find this mantra:
ko 'ddhä veda ka iha pravocat
kuta äyätäù kuta iyaà visåñöiù
arväg devä visarjanenä-
thä ko veda yata ä babhüva
"Who in this world actually knows, and who can explain, whence this creation has come? The demigods, after all, are younger than the creation. Who, then, can tell whence this world has come into being?"
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé thus prays,
kvähaà buddhy-ädi-saàruddhaù
kva ca bhüman mahas tava
déna-bandho dayä-sindho

"What am I, a being entrapped by the material coverings of worldly intelligence and so on? And what are Your glories by comparison, O almighty one? O friend of the fallen, O ocean of mercy, Lord Nåhari, please bless me with Your devotional service."

Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed, that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter, or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always enjoy perfect, total awareness.
The true position of the Supreme Personality is a sublime mystery, as is also the dependent position of the jéva soul. Most thinkers are mistaken in one way or another about these truths, since there are countless varieties of false designation that can cover the soul and create illusion. Foolish conditioned souls submit to obvious delusions, but the illusory power of Mäyä can easily subvert the intelligence of even the most sophisticated philosophers and mystics. Thus there are always divergent schools of thought propounding conflicting theories concerning basic principles of truth.
In traditional Indian philosophy, the followers of Vaiçeñika, Nyäya, Säìkhya, Yoga and Mémäàsä philosophies all have their own erroneous ideas, which the personified Vedas point out in this prayer. The Vaiçeñikas say that the visible universe is created from an original stock of atoms (janim asataù). As Kaëäda Åñi's Vaiçeñika-sütras (7.1.20) state, nityaà parimaëòalam: "That which is of the smallest size, the atom, is eternal. "Kaëäda and his followers also postulate eternality for other, nonatomic entities, including the souls who become embodied, and even a Supreme Soul. But in Vaiçeñika cosmology the souls and the Supersoul play only token roles in the atomic production of the universe. Çréla Kåñëa-dvaipäyana Vedavyäsa criticizes this position in his Vedänta-sütras (2.2.12): ubhayathäpi na karmätas tad-abhävaù. According to this sütra, one cannot claim that, at the time of creation, atoms first combine together because they are impelled by some karmic impulse adhering in the atoms themselves, since atoms by themselves, in their primeval state before combining into complex objects, have no ethical responsibility that might lead them to acquire pious and sinful reactions. Nor can the initial combination of atoms be explained as a result of the residual karma of the living entities who lie dormant prior to creation, since these reactions are each jéva's own and cannot be transferred from them even to other jévas, what to speak of inert atoms.
Alternatively, the phrase janim asataù can be taken to allude to the Yoga philosophy of Pataïjali Åñi, inasmuch as his Yoga-sütras teach one how to achieve the transcendental status of Brahmanhood by a mechanical process of exercise and meditation. Pataïjali's yoga method is here called asat because it ignores the essential aspect of devotion—surrender to the will of the Supreme Person. As Lord Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä (17.28),
açraddhayä hutaà dattaà
tapas taptaà kåtaà ca yat
asad ity ucyate pärtha
na ca tat pretya no iha
"Anything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme, O son of Påthä, is impermanent. It is called asat and is useless both in this life and in the next."
The Yoga-sütras acknowledge the Personality of Godhead in an oblique way, but only as a helper whom the advancing yogé can utilize. Éçvara-praëidhänäd vä: "Devotional meditation on God is yet another means of achieving concentration." (Yoga-sütra 1.23) In contrast, Bädaräyaëa Vedavyäsa's philosophy of Vedänta emphasizes devotional service not only as the primary means to liberation but also as identical with liberation itself. Ä-präyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam: "Worship of the Lord continues up to the point of liberation, and indeed goes on in the liberated state also, as the Vedas reveal." (Vedänta-sütra 4.1.12)
Gautama Åñi, in his Nyäya-sutras, proposes that one can attain liberation by negating both illusion and unhappiness: duùkha-janma-pravåtti-doña-mithyä-jïänänäm uttarottaräpäye tad-anantaräbhäväd apavargaù. "By successively dispelling false conceptions, bad character, entangling action, rebirth and misery—the disappearance of one of these allowing the disappearance of the next—one can achieve final liberation." (Nyäya-sutra 1.1.2) But since Nyäya philosophers believe that awareness is not an essential quality of the soul, they teach that a liberated soul has no consciousness. The Nyäya idea of liberation thus puts the soul in the condition of a dead stone. This attempt by the Nyäya philosophers to kill the soul's innate consciousness is here called sato måtim by the personified Vedas. But the Vedänta-sütra (2.3.17) unequivocally states, jïo 'ta eva: "The jéva soul is always a knower."
Although the soul is in truth both conscious and active, the proponents of Säìkhya philosophy wrongly separate these two functions of the living force (ätmani ye ca bhidäm), ascribing consciousness to the soul (puruña) and activity to material nature (prakåti). According to the Säìkhya-kärikä (19-20),
tasmäc ca viparyäsät
siddhaà säkñitvaà puruñasya
kaivalyaà madhya-sthyaà
drañöåtvam akartå-bhävaç ca
"Thus, since the apparent differences between puruñas are only superficial (being due to the various modes of nature that cover them), the puruña's true status is proven to be that of a witness, characterized by his separateness, his passive indifference, his status of being an observer, and his inactivity."
tasmät tat-saàyogäd
acetanaà cetanä-vad iva liìgam
guëa-kartåtve 'pi tathä
karteva bhavaty udäsénaù
"Thus, by contact with the soul, the unconscious subtle body seems to be conscious, while the soul appears to be the doer although he is aloof from the activity of nature's modes."
Çréla Vyäsadeva refutes this idea in the section of the Vedänta-sütra (2.3.31-39) that begins, kartä çästrärtha-vattvät: "The jéva soul must be a performer of actions, because the injunctions of scripture must have some purpose." Äcärya Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, in his Govinda-bhäñya, explains: "The jéva, not the modes of nature, is the doer. Why? Because the injunctions of scripture must have some purpose (çästrärtha-vattvät). For example, such scriptural injunctions as svarga-kämo yajeta ('One who desires to attain to heaven should perform ritual sacrifice') and ätmänam eva lokam upäséta (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 1.4.15: 'One should worship with the aim of attaining the spiritual kingdom') are meaningful only if a conscious doer exists. If the modes of nature were the doer, these statements would serve no purpose. After all, scriptural injunctions engage the living entity in performing prescribed actions by convincing him that he can act to bring about certain enjoyable results. Such a mentality cannot be aroused in the inert modes of nature."
Jaimini Åñi, in his Pürva-mémäàsä-sütras, presents material work and its results as the whole of reality (vipaëam åtam). He and later proponents of Karma-mémäàsä philosophy teach that material existence is endless—that there is no liberation. For them the cycle of karma is perpetual, and the best one can aim for is higher birth among the demigods. Therefore, they say, the whole purpose of the Vedas is to engage human beings in rituals for creating good karma, and consequently the mature soul's prime responsibility is to ascertain the exact meaning of the Vedas' sacrificial injunctions and to execute them. Codanä-lakñaëo 'rtho dharmaù: "Duty is that which is indicated by the injunctions of the Vedas." (Pürva-mémäàsä-sütra 1.1.2)
The Vedänta-sütra, however—especially in the fourth chapter, which deals with life's ultimate goal—elaborately describes the soul's potential for achieving liberation from birth and death, while it subordinates ritual sacrifice to the role of helping one become qualified to receive spiritual knowledge. As stated there (Vedänta-sütra 4.1.16), agnihoträdi tu tat-käryäyaiva tad-darçanät: "The Agnihotra and other Vedic sacrifices are meant only for producing knowledge, as the statements of the Vedas show." And the very last words of the Vedänta-sütra (4.4.22) proclaim, anävåttiù çabdät: "The liberated soul never returns to this world, as promised by the revealed scripture."
Thus the fallacious conclusions of the speculative philosophers prove that even great scholars and sages are often bewildered by the misuse of their own God—given intelligence. As the Kaöha Upaniñad (1.2.5) says,
avidyäyäm antare vartamänäù
svayaà dhéräù paëòitam-manyamänäù
jaìghanyamänäù pariyanti müòhä
andhenaiva néyamänä yathändhäù
"Caught in the grip of ignorance, self-proclaimed experts consider themselves learned authorities. They wander about this world befooled, like the blind leading the blind."
Of the six orthodox philosophies of Vedic tradition—Säìkhya, Yoga, Nyäya, Vaiçeñika, Mémäàsä and Vedänta—only the Vedänta of Bädaräyaëa Vyäsa is free of error, and even that only as properly explained by the bona fide Vaiñëava äcäryas. Each of the six schools, nonetheless, makes some practical contribution to Vedic education: atheistic Säìkhya explains the evolution of natural elements from subtle to gross, Pataïjali's yoga describes the eightfold method of meditation, Nyäya sets forth the techniques of logic, Vaiçeñika considers the basic metaphysical categories of reality, and Mémäàsä establishes the standard tools of scriptural interpretation. Apart from these six, there are also the more deviant philosophies of the Buddhists, Jains and Cärväkas, whose theories of voidism and materialism deny the spiritual integrity of the eternal soul.
Ultimately, the only perfectly reliable source of knowledge is God Himself. The Personality of Godhead is avabodha-rasa, the infinite reservoir of unfailing vision. To those who depend on Him with absolute conviction, He grants the divine eye of knowledge. Others, following their own speculative theories, must grope for the truth through the obscuring curtain of Mäyä. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,

sat—real; iva—as if; manaù—the mind (and its manifestations); tri-våt—threefold (by the modes of material nature); tvayi—in You; vibhäti—appears; asat—unreal; ä-manujät—extending to the human beings; sat—as real; abhimåçanti—they consider; açeñam—entire; idam—this (world); ätmatayä—as nondifferent from the Self; ätma-vidaù—the knowers of the Self; na—not; hi—indeed; vikåtim—the transformations; tyajanti—reject; kanakasya—of gold; tat-ätmatayä—inasmuch as they are nondifferent from it; sva—by Himself; kåtam—created; anupraviñöam—and entered; idam—this; ätmatayä—as nondifferent from Himself; avasitam—ascertained.
The three modes of material nature comprise everything in this world—from the simplest phenomena to the complex human body. Although these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still, those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord who created it and then entered within it.
In one sense the visible world is real (sat), while in another it is not (asat). The substance of this universe is solid fact, being the Lord's external energy, but the forms that Mäyä imposes on this substance are only temporary. And because material forms are temporary manifestations, those who consider them permanent are in illusion. Impersonalistic scholars, however, misinterpret this division of sat and asat; denying commonsense reality, they declare that not only material form but also material substance is unreal, and they confuse their own spiritual essence with that of the Absolute Whole. A Mäyävädé philosopher would take the words spoken by the personified Vedas in the preceding prayer—tri-guëa-mayaù pumän iti bhidä—as negating any distinction between the Paramätmä and the jéva soul. He would claim that since the jéva's material embodiment is an ephemeral display of the three modes of nature, when the jéva's ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, he becomes the Paramätmä, the Supreme Soul; bondage, liberation and the manifest world are all unreal creations of ignorance. In response to such ideas, the Vedas here clarify the factual relationship between sat and asat.
In the çruti literature we find this statement: asato 'dhimano 'såjyata, manaù prajäpatim asåjat, prajäpatiù prajä asåjat, tad vä idaà manasy eva paramaà pratiñöhitaà yad idaà kià ca. "The supreme mind was originally created from asat. This mind created Prajäpati, and Prajäpati created all living beings. Thus mind alone is the ultimate foundation of everything that exists in this world." Although impersonalists might misread this to mean that all manifest existence is based on the unreality of illusion (asat), the apparently contrary use of the word asat in this passage actually refers to the original cause, the Supreme Godhead, because He is transcendental to material existence (sat). The logic of the Vedänta-sütra (2.1.17) corroborates this interpretation while denying the wrong interpretation of the impersonalists: asad-vyapadeçän neti cen na dharmäntareëa väkya-çeñät. "If one objects that the material world and its source cannot be of one substance because the world has been called unreal, we reply, 'No, because the statement that Brahman is asat makes sense in terms of His having qualities distinct from those of the creation.' " Thus the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.7.1) declares, asad vä idam agra äsét: "In the beginning of this creation, only asat was present."
In the opinion of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word adhimanaù in the passage quoted above refers to the ruler of the aggregate mind of the universe, Lord Aniruddha, who appears as a plenary expansion of Çré Näräyaëa when the latter desires to create. Prajäpati is Brahmä, the father of all other created beings. This is described in the Mahä-näräyaëa Upaniñad (1.4): atha punar eva näräyaëaù so 'nyaà kämaà manasä dhyäyet. tasya dhyänäntaù-sthasya lalanät svedo 'patat. tä imä pratatäpa täsu tejo hiraë-mayam aëòaà tatra brahmä catur-mukho 'jäyata. "Then Lord Näräyaëa meditated upon another desire of His, and as He pondered, a drop of perspiration fell from His forehead. All the material creations evolved from the fermentation of this drop. Therein the fiery, golden egg of the universe appeared, and within that globe four-headed Brahmä took his birth."
When a particular object is manufactured, it appears as a transformation of its ingredient cause, as in the case of jewelry made from gold. Persons who want gold will not reject gold earrings or necklaces, since these items are still gold, despite their modification. True jïänés see in this mundane example an analogy to the different-yet-nondifferent relationship of the Puruña and His emanations, both material and spiritual. Thus this transcendental knowledge frees them from the bondage of illusion, for they can then see the Lord throughout His creation.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,

"Let us worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by virtue of whose substantial existence this created world seems to exist perpetually, although it is essentially insubstantial. As the Supersoul, He constitutes the representation of the real within this unreality."

tava—You; pari ye caranti—who worship; akhila—of all; sattva—created entities; niketatayä—as the shelter; te—they; uta—simply; padä—with their feet; äkramanti—step upon; avigaëayya—disregarding; çiraù—the head; niråteù—of Death; parivayase—You tie up; paçün iva—like animals; girä—with Your words (of the Vedas); vibudhän—wise; api—even; tän—them; tvayi—to whom; kåta—those who have made; sauhådäù—friendship; khalu—indeed; punanti—purify; na—not; ye—who; vimukhäù—inimical.
The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves and others, not those who are inimical to You.
The personified Vedas have now set aside the erroneous philosophies of several contending schools: the asad-utpatti-väda of the Vaiçeñikas, who presume a material source of creation; the sad-vinäça-vada of the Naiyäyikas, who would deprive the liberated soul of consciousness; the saguëatva-bheda-väda of the Säìkhyas, who isolate the soul from all his apparent qualities; the vipaëa-väda of the Mémäàsakas, who condemn the soul to eternal involvement in the mundane commerce of karma; and the vivarta-väda of the Mäyävädés, who denigrate the soul's real life in this world as a hallucination. Having rejected all these ideas, the personified Vedas now present the philosophy of devotional service, paricaryä-väda.
The Vaiñëavas who accept this philosophy teach that the jéva soul is an atomic particle of spiritual personality who possesses minute knowledge, is not independent and has no material qualities. Being minute, he is prone to come under the control of the material energy, where he suffers the pains of material life. He can end his suffering and regain the shelter of the Supreme Lord's divine, internal energy only by rendering devotional service to the Lord, not by engaging in fruitive work, mental speculation or any other process.
As Lord Kåñëa says in His own words,
bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù
çraddhayätmä priyaù satäm
bhaktiù punäti man-niñöhä
çva-päkän api sambhavät
"Only by practicing unalloyed devotional service with full faith in Me can one obtain Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am naturally dear to My devotees, who take Me as the only goal of their loving service. By engaging in such pure devotional service, even the dog-eaters can purify themselves from the contamination of their low birth." (SB 11.14.21)
Devotees of the Personality of Godhead worship Him as the shelter (niketa) of everything that exists (akhila-sattva). Moreover, these Vaiñëava devotees themselves can be called akhila-sattva-niketa in the sense that their abode and shelter is the philosophic truth of the reality (sattvam) of both the material and spiritual worlds. Thus Çrépäda Madhväcärya, in his Vedänta-sütra-bhäñya, quotes the çruti-mantra: satyaà hy evedaà viçvam asåjata. "He created this world as real." And the Seventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.1.11) refers to the Supreme Lord as pradhäna-pumbhyäà naradeva satya-kåt, "the creator of a real universe of matter and living entities."
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out yet another, more confidential, meaning of akhila-sattva-niketa: that the Supreme Lord's personal abodes are in no way khila, or imperfect, and so are called Vaikuëöha, the realms free of anxiety and restriction. Vaiñëavas whose devotional service the Lord has kindly accepted are so sure of His protection that they no longer fear death, which becomes for them just another easy step on the way back to their eternal home.
But are only devotees of the Supreme Lord eligible for liberation from the fear of death? Why are all other mystics and learned scholars disqualified? Here the çrutis answer: "Anyone who is vimukha, who has not turned his face toward the Lord with hopeful expectation of His mercy, is bound up in illusion by the same words of the Vedas that enlighten the surrendered devotees." The Vedas themselves warn, tasya väk-tantir nämäni dämäni. tasyedaà väcä tantyä nämabhir dämabhiù sarvaà sitam: "The threads of this transcendental sound form a string of sacred names, but also a set of binding ropes. With the rope of their injunctions, the Vedas tie up this entire world, leaving all beings fettered by false designations."
The reality of the soul and Supersoul is aparokña, perceivable, but only to one with transcendental vision. Philosophers whose hearts are impure mistakenly presume that this truth is instead parokña, that it can only be speculated upon and never experienced directly. The knowledge of such thinkers may help them dispel certain doubts and misconceptions about the lesser aspects of reality, but it is useless for transcending material illusion and approaching the Absolute Truth. As a general rule, only the devotees who faithfully render loving service unto the Supreme Lord up to the point of complete purification receive His grace in the form of aparokña-jïäna, direct realization of His greatness and wonderful compassion. The Personality of Godhead is of course free to award His mercy even to the undeserving, as He does when He personally kills offensive demons, but He is much less inclined to bless Mäyävädés and other atheistic philosophers.
One should not think, however, that the devotees of Viñëu are ignorant because they may not be expert in philosophic analysis and argument. The soul's perfect realization is to be gained not through his own efforts at mental speculation but by receiving the Lord's favor. This we hear from Vedic authority (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.2.23 and Muëòaka Upaniñad 3.2.3):
näyam ätmä pravacanena labhyo
na medhayä na bahunä çrutena
yam evaiña våëute tena labhyas
tasyaiña ätmä vivåëute tanüà sväm
"This Supreme Self cannot be reached by argumentation, or by applying one's independent brain power, or by studying many scriptures. Rather, he alone can achieve the Self whom the Self chooses to favor. To that person the Self reveals His own true, personal form."
Elsewhere the çruti describes the devotee's success: dehänte devaù paraà brahma tärakaà vyacañöe. "At the end of this body's life, the sanctified soul perceives the Supreme Lord just as clearly as if seeing the stars in the sky." And in its last statement, the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.23) offers this encouragement to aspiring Vaiñëavas:
yasya deve parä bhaktir
yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù
prakäçante mahätmanaù
 [ÇU  6.23]
"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed."
In this regard Çréla Jéva Gosvämé cites other verses of Çré Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (4.7-8 and 4.13):
juñöaà yadä paçyaty anyam éçam
asya mahimänam iti véta-çokaù
åco 'kñare pare vyoman
yasmin devä adhi viçve niñeduù
yas taà veda kim åcä kariñyati
ya it tad vidus ta ime samäsate
"The Supreme Lord is He who is referred to by the mantras of the Åg Veda, who resides in the topmost, eternal sky, and who elevates His saintly devotees to share that same position. One who has developed pure love for Him and realizes His uniqueness then appreciates His glories and is freed from sorrow. What further good can the Åg mantras bestow on one who knows that Supreme Lord? All who come to know Him achieve the supreme destination."
yo vedänäm adhipo

"To Him who is the master of all the Vedas, in whom all planets rest, who is the Lord of all known creatures, both the two-legged and the four-legged—to Him, the Personality of Godhead, we offer our worship with oblations of ghee."
Referring to those who desire liberation, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
tapantu täpaiù prapatantu parvatäd
aöantu térthäni paöhantu cägamän
yajantu yägair vivadantu vädair

"Let them suffer austerities, throw themselves from mountaintops, travel to holy places, study the scriptures, worship with fire sacrifices and argue various philosophies, but without Lord Hari they will never cross beyond death."

tvam—You; akaraëaù—devoid of material senses; sva-räö—self-effulgent; akhila—of all; käraka—sensory functions; çakti—of the potencies; dharaù—the maintainer; tava—Your; balim—tribute; udvahanti—carry; samadanti—and partake of; ajayä—along with material nature; animiñäù—the demigods; varña—of districts of a kingdom; bhujaù—the rulers; akhila—entire; kñiti—of the land; pateù—of the lord; iva—as if; viçva—of the universe; såjaù—the creators; vidadhati—execute; yatra—in which; ye—they; tu—indeed; adhikåtä—assigned; bhavataù—of You; cakitäù—afraid.
Though You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent sustainer of everyone's sensory powers. The demigods and material nature herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land, while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services out of fear of You.
All intelligent living beings should acknowledge the sovereignty of the Lord and willingly engage in devotional service to Him. Such is the consensus of the personified Vedas. But Lord Näräyaëa, while hearing these prayers, may have reasonably asked, "Since I also have a bodily form with sense organs and limbs, am I not just another doer and enjoyer? Especially since as the Supersoul in every being's heart I supervise countless organs and limbs, how am I not implicated in the sum total of everyone's sense gratification?" "No," the assembled çrutis here rejoin, "You have no material senses, yet You are the absolute controller of all." As expressed in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.18),
apäëi-pädo javano grahétä
paçyaty acakñuù sa çåëoty akarëaù
sa vetti vedyaà na ca tasya vettä
tam ähur agryaà puruñaà puräëam
"He has no feet or hands, yet He is the swiftest runner and can grasp anything. Though without eyes or ears, He sees and hears. Nobody knows Him, yet He is the knower and the object of knowledge. Sages describe Him as the supreme, original Personality of Godhead."
The hands, feet, eyes and ears of the Supreme Person are not like those of an ordinary, conditioned soul, which are derived from false ego, a material substance. Rather, the Lord's transcendentally beautiful features are direct manifestations of His internal nature. Thus, unlike the soul and body of conditioned living beings, the Lord and His bodily form are identical in all respects. Moreover, His lotus hands, lotus feet, lotus eyes and other limbs are not restricted in their functions. Çré Brahmä, the Lord's first creature, glorifies Him on this account:
angäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti
paçyanti pänti kalayanti ciraà jaganti
änanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam ädi-puruñam tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth and substantiality and thus emanates the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in itself the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and He eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and material." (Bs. 5.32)
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté gives an alternative explanation of the phrase akhila-çakti-dhara: The power that the Supreme Lord maintains within Himself is akhila, free from the limitations of all that is khila, or inferior and insignificant. He energizes the living being's senses, as described by the Kena Upaniñad (1.2): çrotrasya çrotraà manaso mano yad väco ha väcam. "He is the ear's ear, the mind's mind, and the voice's capacity of speech." And the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.8) declares,
na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate
na tat-samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate
paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate
sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca
 [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]
"He has no material work to perform, nor any material senses with which to perform it. No one can be found who is equal to or greater than Him. From the Vedas we hear how that Supreme Lord possesses multifarious energies—the potencies of knowledge, strength and action—each of which acts autonomously."
Indra and the other demigods who rule over mortal beings are themselves servants of the Personality of Godhead, as are their superiors—Brahmä and his sons, the secondary creators. All of these great gods and sages worship the Supreme Lord by performing their respective services of managing the universe and providing religious guidance for mankind.
The powerful controllers of the universe submit themselves in fearful reverence to the supreme controller, Lord Çré Viñëu. As the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.8.1) states,
bhéñäsmäd vätaù pavate
bhéñäd eti süryaù
bhéñäsmäd agniç cendraç ca
måtyur dhävati païcamaù
"Out of fear of Him, the wind blows. Out of fear of Him, the sun moves and Agni and Indra execute their duties. And death, the fifth of their number, races along out of fear of Him."
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,

O eternally liberated, transcendental Lord, Your material energy causes the various moving and nonmoving species of life to appear by activating their material desires, but only when and if You sport with her by briefly glancing at her. You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, see no one as an intimate friend and no one as a stranger, just as the ethereal sky has no connection with perceptible qualities. In this sense You resemble a void.
Not only are living beings totally dependent on the all-powerful, independent Lord for their maintenance and welfare, but even the very fact of their embodied existence is due only to His exceptional mercy. The Personality of Godhead has no interest in material affairs, since He has nothing to gain from the petty pleasures of this world and is altogether free from any contamination of envy or lust. He is exclusively involved in confidential, loving pastimes with His pure devotees in the internal realm of His spiritual energies. Therefore the only reason He ever turns to the business of material creation is to help draw lost souls back into this inner circle of eternal enjoyment.
To attempt a life separate from the Lord, rebellious souls must be provided with suitable bodies and an illusory environment in which to act out their fantasies of independence. The merciful Lord agrees to let them learn in their own way, and so He glances at Mahä-Mäyä, His energy of material creation. Simply by this glance, she is awakened and makes all required arrangements on His behalf. She and her helpers manufacture countless varieties of gross and subtle bodies of demigods, humans, animals and so on, along with countless situations in heavenly and hellish worlds—all just to give the conditioned souls the exact facilities they desire and deserve.
While the uninformed may blame God for the suffering of His creatures, a sincere student of the Vedic literature will come to appreciate the Supreme Lord's equal concern for each soul. Since He has nothing to lose or gain, there is no reason for Him to distinguish between friends and opponents. We may choose to oppose Him and make all endeavors to forget Him, but He never forgets us, nor does He ever stop providing us with all our necessities, along with His unseen guidance.

If the countless living entities were all-pervading and possessed forms that never changed, You could not possibly be their absolute ruler, O immutable one. But since they are Your localized expansions and their forms are subject to change, You do control them. Indeed, that which supplies the ingredients for the generation of something is necessarily its controller because a product never exists apart from its ingredient cause. It is simply illusion for someone to think that he knows the Supreme Lord, who is equally present in each of His expansions, since whatever knowledge one gains by material means must be imperfect.
Because the conditioned soul cannot directly understand the Supreme, the Vedas commonly refer to that Supreme Truth in such impersonal terms as Brahman and oà tat sat. If an ordinary scholar presumes to know the confidential meaning of these symbolic references, he should be rejected as an imposter. In the words of Çré Kena Upaniñad (2.1), yadi manyase su-vedeti dabhram eväpi nünaà tvaà vettha brahmaëo rüpaà, yad asya tvaà yad asya deveñu: "If you think you know Brahman well, then your knowledge is very meager. If you think you can identify Brahman's form from among the demigods, indeed you know but little." And again,
yasyämataà tasya mataà
mataà yasya na veda saù
avijïätaà vijänatäà
vijïätam avijänatäm
"Whoever denies having any opinion of his own about the Supreme Truth is correct in his opinion, whereas one who has his own opinion about the Supreme does not know Him. He is unknown to those who claim to know Him, and can only be known by those who do not claim to know Him." (Kena Upaniñad 2.3)
Äcärya Çrédhara Svämé gives the following explanation of this verse: Many philosophers have studied the mysteries of life from various perspectives and have formed widely differing theories. The Advaita Mäyävädés, for example, propose that there is only one living being and one power of illusion (avidyä) that covers him, producing the appearance of plurality. But this hypothesis leads to the absurd conclusion that when any one living being becomes liberated, everyone obtains liberation. If, on the other hand, there are many avidyäs to cover the one living being, each avidyä will cover only some part of him, and we would have to talk about his becoming partly liberated at particular times while his other parts remain in bondage. This is also obviously absurd. Thus the plurality of living beings is an unavoidable conclusion.
Furthermore, there are other theoreticians, namely the proponents of Nyäya and Vaiçeñika, who claim that the jéva soul is infinite in size. If souls were infinitesimal, these scholars argue, they would not pervade their own bodies, whereas if they were of medium size they would be divisible into parts and thus could not be eternal, at least according to the axioms of Nyäya-Vaiçeñika metaphysics. But if the numerous eternal jéva souls are each infinitely large, how could they be covered by any power of bondage, whether belonging to avidyä or to the Supreme Lord Himself? According to this theory, there can be no illusion for the soul, no limitations from which to be liberated. The infinite souls must eternally remain as they are, without change. This would mean that the souls would all be equal to God, since He would have no scope for controlling these all-pervading, unchanging rivals.
The Vedic çruti-mantras, which affirm unequivocally the mastery of the Lord over the individual souls, cannot be validly contradicted. A true philosopher must accept the statements of çruti as reliable authority on all matters they touch. Certainly in numerous places the Vedic literatures contrast the Supreme Lord's perpetual, unchanging oneness with the ever-changing embodiments of living beings caught up in the cycle of birth and death.

na ghaöate—does not happen; udbhavaù—the generation; prakåti—of material nature; püruñayoù—and of the soul who is her enjoyer; ajayoù—who are unborn; ubhaya—of both; yujä—by the combination; bhavanti—come into being; asu-bhåtaù—living bodies; jala—on water; budbuda—bubbles; vat—like; tvayi—in You; te ime—these (living beings); tataù—therefore; vividha—various; näma—with names; guëaiù—and qualities; parame—in the Supreme; saritaù—rivers; iva—as; arëave—within the ocean; madhuni—in honey; lilyuù—become merged; açeña—all; rasäù—flavors.
Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey, so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.
Without proper spiritual guidance, one may misunderstand the Vedas' description of the living entities emanating from the Lord to mean that they have come into being in this process and will eventually pass again into nonexistence. But if the living entities were to thus have only temporary existence, then when one of them would die his remaining karma would simply vanish without being used up, and when a soul would be born he would appear with unaccountable karma he had done nothing to earn. Furthermore, a living being's liberation would amount to the total eradication of his identity and being.
The truth is, however, that the soul's essence is one with Brahman's, just as the small portion of space contained within the walls of a clay pot is one in essence with the all-expanding sky. And like the making and breaking of a pot, the "birth" of an individual soul consists of his first becoming covered by a material body, and his "death," or liberation, consists of the destruction of his gross and subtle bodies once and for all. Certainly such "birth" and "death" take place only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord.
The combination of material nature and her controller that produces the numerous conditioned beings in material creation is likened here to the combination of water and air that produces countless bubbles of foam on the surface of the sea. Just as the efficient cause, air, impels the ingredient cause, water, to form itself into bubbles, so by His glance the Supreme Puruña inspires prakåti to transform herself into the array of material elements and the innumerable material forms manifest from those elements. Prakåti thus serves as the upädäna-käraëa, or ingredient cause, of creation. In the ultimate issue, however, since she is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord, it is the Lord alone who is the ingredient cause as well as the efficient cause. This is as stated in the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.2.1), tasmäd vä etasmäd ätmana äkäçaù sambhütaù: "From this Supreme Soul the ether evolved," and so 'kämayata bahu syäà prajäyeya: "He desired, 'Let Me become many by expanding into progeny.' "
The individual jéva souls are not created when "born" from the Supreme Lord and prakåti, nor are they destroyed when they "merge" back into the Lord, rejoining Him in the pleasure pastimes of His eternal kingdom. And in the same way as the infinitesimal jévas can appear to undergo birth and death without any factual change, the Supreme Lord can send forth and withdraw His emanations without Himself undergoing any transformation. Thus the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.5.14) affirms, avinäçi väre 'yam ätmä: "This ätmä is indeed indestructible"—a statement that can be applied to both the Supreme Soul and the subordinate jéva soul.
As explained by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the dissolution of the living being's material condition occurs in two ways, partial and complete. partial dissolution occurs when the soul experiences dreamless sleep, when he leaves his body and when all souls reenter the body of Mahä-Viñëu at the time of universal annihilation. These different types of dissolution are like the mixing of nectar brought by bees from different kinds of flowers. The different flavors of nectar represent the dormant individual karmic reactions of each living entity, which still exist but cannot easily be distinguished from one another. In contrast, the ultimate dissolution of the soul's material condition is his liberation from saàsära, which is like the flowing of rivers into the ocean. As the waters from different rivers merge together after entering the ocean and become indistinguishable from one another, so the false material designations of the jévas are given up at the time of liberation and all the liberated jévas once again become equally situated as servants of the Supreme Lord.
The Upaniñads describe these dissolutions as follows: yathä saumya madhu madhu-kåto nistiñöhanti nänätyayänäà våkñänäà rasän samavahäram ekatäà saìgayanti. te yathä tatra na vivekaà labhante amuñyähaà våkñasya raso 'smy amuñyäham raso 'sméty evam eva khalu saumyemäù sarväù prajäù sati sampadya na viduù sati sampadyämahe: "My dear boy, this [partial dissolution] resembles what happens when honeybees collect honey by extracting the nectar from the flowers of various kinds of trees and merge it all into a single mixture. Just as the mixed nectars cannot distinguish, 'I am the juice of such-and-such a flower,' or 'I am the juice of another flower,' so, dear boy, when all these living entities merge together they cannot consciously think, 'Now we have merged together.' " (Chändogya Upaniñad 6.9.1-2)
yathä nadyaù syandamänäù samudre
'staà gacchanti näma-rüpe vihäya
tathä vidvän näma-rüpäd vimuktaù
parät-paraà puruñam upaiti divyam
"As rivers flow to their dissolution in the sea, giving up their names and forms at their destination, so the wise man who becomes free from material names and forms attains to the Supreme Absolute, the wonderful Personality of Godhead." (Muëòaka Upaniñad 3.2.8)
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,

"The Supreme Lord is self-effulgently omniscient. By His great mercy, this universe, which is subject to repeated creation and destruction, remains present within Him after merging back into Him along with the living entities at the time of cosmic dissolution. This total withdrawal of the universal manifestation occurs suddenly, like the flowing of a river into the ocean. Within the core of my heart I meditate upon that master of the three worlds, Lord Nåsiàha."

nåñu—among humans; tava—Your; mäyayä—by the illusory energy; bhramam—bewilderment; améñu—among these; avagatya—understanding; bhåçam—fervent; tvayi—unto You; su-dhiyaù—those who are wise; abhave—unto the source of liberation; dadhati—render; bhävam—loving service; anuprabhavam—potent; katham—how; anuvartatäm—for those who follow You faithfully; bhava—of material life; bhayam—fear; tava—Your; yat—since; bhru—of the eyebrows; kuöiù—the furrowing; såjati—creates; muhuù—repeatedly; tri-nemiù—three-rimmed (in the three phases of time, namely past, present and future); a—not; bhavat—from You; çaraëeñu—for those who take shelter; bhayam—fear.
The wise souls who understand how Your Mäyä deludes all human beings render potent loving service to You, who are the source of liberation from birth and death. How, indeed, can fear of material life affect Your faithful servants? On the other hand, Your furrowing eyebrows—the triple-rimmed wheel of time—repeatedly terrify those who refuse to take shelter of You.
The Vedas reveal their most cherished secret—devotional service to the Personality of Godhead—only to those who are tired of material illusion, which is based on a false sense of independence from the Lord. The Väjasaneyé-saàhitä (32.11) of the White Yajur Veda contains the following mantra:
parétya bhütäni parétya lokän
parétya sarväù pradiço diçaç ca
upasthäya prathama-jämåtasyä-
manätmänam abhisaàviveça
"After passing beyond all the species of life, all the planetary systems and all the limits of space in all directions, one approaches the original Soul of immortality. Then one receives the opportunity to enter permanently into His domain and worship Him with personal service."
The proponents of various contending materialistic philosophies may consider themselves very wise, but they are in fact all deluded by the Supreme Lord's Mäyä. Vaiñëavas recognize this pattern of general delusion and submit themselves to the Supreme Lord in the devotional moods of servitude, friendship and so on. Instead of the heat and strife of philosophical quarrel, the pure Vaiñëavas experience only delight at every moment, because the object of their love is He who brings an end to material entanglement. And the devotees of Lord Viñëu enjoy constant pleasure not only in this life but in future lives. In whatever births they take, they enjoy loving reciprocations with the Lord. Thus the sincere Vaiñëava prays,
nätha yoni-sahasreñu
yeñu yeñu bhramämy aham
tatra taträcyutä bhaktir
acyutästu dåòhä tvayi
"Wherever I may wander, O master, among thousands of species of life, in each situation may I have firmly fixed devotion to You, O Acyuta." (Viñëu Puräëa)
Some philosophers will question how the Vaiñëavas can overcome their material entrapment without thorough analytic knowledge of the entities tvam ("you," the jéva) and tat ("that," the Supreme), and without developing a sufficient hatred of material life. The personified Vedas here answer that there is no chance of material illusion continuing to act on devotees of the Lord because even in the earliest stages of devotional service all fear and attachment are removed by the Lord's grace.
Time is the root cause of all fear in this world. Indeed, with its three divisions of past, present and future it creates terror at the prospect of impending disease, death and hellish suffering—but only for those who have failed to obtain shelter at the feet of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord Himself says in the Rämäyaëa (Yuddha-käëòa 12.20),
sakåd eva prapanno yas
taväsméti ca yäcate
abhayaà sarvadä tasmai
dadämy etad vrataà mama
"To whomever even once surrenders to Me, pleading 'I am Yours,' I give eternal fearlessness. This is my solemn vow." Furthermore, in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.14) the Lord says,
daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé
mama mäyä duratyayä
mäm eva ye prapadyante
mäyäà etäà taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it."
Vaiñëavas do not like to waste their time in prolonged and fruitless wrangling over dry philosophic subjects. They would rather worship the Personality of Godhead than quarrel with philosophical adversaries. The Vaiñëavas' understanding concurs with the essential message of revealed scripture. These devotees' conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth as the infinite ocean of personality and loving pastimes in His worshipable forms of Kåñëa, Räma and other divine manifestations, and their conception of themselves as His eternal servants, amount to the perfect conclusion of Vedänta philosophy in terms of the entities tat and tvam.
The Personality of Godhead and His emanations, such as the jéva souls, are simultaneously different and nondifferent, just like the sun and its expanding rays. There are more jévas than anyone can count, and each of them is eternally alive with consciousness, as the çrutis confirm: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm. (Kaöha Upaniñad 5.13 and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.13) When they are sent forth from the body of Mahä-Viñëu at the beginning of material creation, the jévas are all equal in the sense that they are all atomic particles of the Lord's marginal energy. But according to their differing conditions, they divide into four groups: Some are covered by ignorance, which obscures their vision like a cloud. Others become liberated from ignorance through a combination of knowledge and devotion. A third group of souls become endowed with pure devotion, with a slight mixture of desire for speculative knowledge and fruitive activity. Those souls attain purified bodies composed of perfect knowledge and bliss with which they can engage in the Lord's service. Finally, there are those who are devoid of any connection with ignorance; these are the Lord's eternal associates.
The marginal position of the jéva soul is described in the Närada Païcarätra:
yat taöa-sthaà tu cid-rüpaà
sva-saàvedyäd vinirgatam
raïjitaà guëa-rägeëa
sa jéva iti kathyate
"The taöa-stha potency should be understood as emanating from the Lord's saàvit [knowledge] energy. This emanation, called the jéva, becomes conditioned by the qualities of material nature." Because the minute jéva lives within the margin between the Lord's external, illusory potency, Mäyä, and His internal, spiritual potency, cit, the jéva is called taöa-stha, "marginal." When he earns liberation by cultivating devotion to the Lord, however, he comes completely under the shelter of the Lord's internal potency, and at that time he is no longer tainted by the modes of material nature. Lord Kåñëa confirms this in the Bhagavad-gétä (14.26):
mäà ca yo 'vyabhicäreëa
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa guëän samatétyaitän
brahma-bhüyäya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."
The object of the soul's worship is realized in three aspects: Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Impersonal Brahman is like the radiant effulgence of the sun; the Supersoul, or Paramätmä, is like the sun globe; and the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, is like the presiding deity within the sun, complemented by his elaborate entourage and paraphernalia. Or, to cite another analogy, travelers approaching a city from a distance cannot at first distinguish its features but rather see something vaguely shining ahead of them. As they come closer, they may discern a few of the taller buildings. Then, when they are sufficiently close, they will see the city as it is—a bustling metropolis with many citizens, residences, public buildings, highways and parks. In the same way, persons inclined to impersonal meditation may at best gain some realization of the Supreme Lord's effulgence (Brahman), those who approach closer can learn to see Him as the Lord in the heart (Paramätmä), and those who come very close can know Him in His full personality (Bhagavän).
In summary, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
saàsära-cakra-krakacair vidérëam
udérëa-nänä-bhava-täpa-taptam

"O Çré Nåhari, please deliver those human beings who have suffered all kinds of torments and been ripped apart by the sharp edge of saàsära's wheel but who have now somehow found You and are surrendering themselves unto You."

vijita—conquered; håñéka—with senses; väyubhiù—and vital air; adänta—not brought under control; manaù—the mind; tura-gam—(which is like) a horse; ye—those who; iha—in this world; yatanti—endeavor; yantum—to regulate; ati—very; lolam—unsteady; upäya—by their various methods of cultivation; khidaù—distressed; vyasana—disturbances; çata—by hundreds; anvitäù—joined; samavahäya—abandoning; guroù—of the spiritual master; caraëam—the feet; vaëijaù—merchants; iva—as if; aja—O unborn one; santi—they are; akåta—having not taken; karëa-dharäù—a helmsman; jala-dhau—on the ocean.
The mind is like an impetuous horse that even persons who have regulated their senses and breath cannot control. Those in this world who try to tame the uncontrolled mind, but who abandon the feet of their spiritual master, encounter hundreds of obstacles in their cultivation of various distressful practices. O unborn Lord, they are like merchants on a boat in the ocean who have failed to employ a helmsman.
To become qualified to attain love of Godhead, the mature fruit of liberation, one must first subdue the rebellious material mind. Though difficult, this can be achieved when a person replaces his addictions to sense gratification with a taste for the higher pleasures of spiritual life. But only by the favor of the representative of Godhead, the spiritual master, can one gain this higher taste.
The spiritual master opens the eyes of the disciple to the wonders of the transcendental realm, as indicated in the Gäyatré prayers by the seed mantra of divine knowledge, aià.
The Muëòaka Upaniñad (1.2.12) states,
tad-vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigacchet
samit-päëiù çrotriyaà brahma-niñöham
"To understand these things properly, one must humbly approach, with firewood in hand, a spiritual master who is learned in the Vedas and firmly devoted to the Absolute Truth." And the Kaöha Upaniñad (2.9) declares,
naiñä tarkeëa matir äpaneyä
proktänyenaiva su-jïänäya preñöha
"This realization, my dear boy, cannot be acquired by logic. It must be spoken by an exceptionally qualified spiritual master to a knowledgeable disciple."
Non-Vaiñëavas often disregard the importance of surrendering to a spiritual master who stands in an authorized line of disciplic succession. Relying instead on their own abilities, proud yogés and jïänés exhibit their apparent success to impress the world, but their glory is but temporary:
yuïjänänäm abhaktänäà
präëäyämädibhir manaù
akñéëa-väsanaà räjan
dåçyate punar utthitam
"The minds of nondevotees who engage in such practices as präëäyäma are not fully cleansed of material desires. Thus, O King, material desires are again seen to arise in their minds." (SB 10.51.60)
On the other hand, a humble, steadfast devotee of Lord Viñëu and of the Vaiñëavas is assured of easy victory over the stubborn mind. He need not concern himself with performing the eightfold system of yoga or taking other such measures to keep his mind steady. Sarvaà caitad gurau bhaktyä puruño hy aïjasä jayet: "A person can easily obtain all these goals simply by being devoted to his spiritual master." Otherwise, a nondevotee may conquer his senses and vital air and still fail to tame his mind, which will continue to run wild like an unbroken horse. He will suffer unending anxiety over the troublesome execution of various spiritual practices, and in the end he will remain just as lost in the vast material ocean as he ever was. The analogy given here is very appropriate: A group of merchants who hastily enter upon a sea voyage with expectations of great profit, but who fail to hire a competent helmsman for their boat, will simply experience great difficulty.
The Bhägavatam declares the importance of the bona fide spiritual master in many places, such as this verse from the Eleventh Canto (20.17):
nå-deham ädyam su-labhaà su-durlabhaà
plavaà su-kalpaà guru-karëa-dhäram
mayänukülena nabhasvateritaà
pumän bhaväbdhià na taret sa ätma-hä
"The human body, which can award all benefit in life, is automatically obtained by the laws of nature, although it is a very rare achievement. This human body can be compared to a perfectly constructed boat having the spiritual master as the captain and the instructions of the Personality of Godhead as favorable winds impelling it on its course. Considering all these advantages, a human being who does not utilize his human life to cross the ocean of material existence must be considered the killer of his own soul." Therefore the first business of one who takes human life seriously is to find out a spiritual master who can guide him in Kåñëa consciousness.

To those persons who take shelter of You, You reveal Yourself as the Supersoul, the embodiment of all transcendental pleasure. What further use have such devotees for their servants, children or bodies, their wives, money or houses, their land, good health or conveyances? And for those who fail to appreciate the truth about You and go on pursuing the pleasures of sex, what could there be in this entire world—a place inherently doomed to destruction and devoid of significance—that could give them real happiness?
Devotional service to Lord Viñëu is considered pure when one's sole desire is to please the Lord. Situated in that perfect consciousness, a Vaiñëava has no further interest in wordly gains and is thus excused from any obligation to perform ritual sacrifices and follow austere practices of yoga. As the Muëòaka Upaniñad (1.2.12) states,
parékñya lokän karma-citän brähmaëo
nirvedam äyän nästy akåtaù kåtena
"When a brähmaëa recognizes that elevation to the heavenly planets is merely another accumulation of karma, he becomes renounced and is no longer corrupted by his actions." The Båhad-äraëyaka (4.4.9) and Kaöha (6.14) Upaniñads confirm,
yadä sarve pramucyante
kämä ye 'sya hådi çritäù
atha martyo 'måto bhavaty
atra brahma samaçnute
"When a person completely gives up all the sinful desires he is harboring in his heart, he exchanges mortality for eternal spiritual life and attains real pleasure in the Absolute Truth." And the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad (Pürva 15) concludes, bhaktir asya bhajanaà tad ihämutropädhi-nairäsyenämuñmin manaù-kalpanam etad eva naiñkarmyam." Devotional service is the process of worshiping the Supreme Lord. It consists of fixing one's mind upon Him by becoming disinterested in all material designations, both in this life and the next. This indeed, is true renunciation."
The items the çrutis mention here are all measures of worldly success: svajanäù, servants; ätmä, a beautiful body; sutäù, children to be proud of; däräù, an attractive and competent spouse; dhanam, financial assets; dhäma, a prestigious residence; dharä, holdings of land; asavaù, health and strength; and rathäù, cars and other vehicles that display one's status. But one who has begun to experience the ecstasy of devotional service loses all attraction for these things, since he finds real satisfaction in the Supreme Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, who enjoys by sharing His own pleasures with His servitors.
We are each free to choose the course of our life: we can either dedicate our body, mind, words, talents and wealth to the glory of God, or else we can ignore Him and struggle instead for our personal happiness. The second path leads to a life of slavery to sex and ambition, in which the soul never feels real satisfaction but instead suffers continually. Vaiñëavas are distressed to see materialists suffering in this way, and so they always strive to enlighten them.

bhuvi—on the earth; puru—greatly; puëya—pious; tértha—places of pilgrimage; sadanäni—and personal abodes of the Supreme Lord; åñayaù—sages; vimadaù—free from false pride; te—they; uta—indeed; bhavat—Your; pada—feet; ambuja—lotus; hådaù—in whose hearts; agha—sins; bhit—which destroys; aìghri—(having bathed) whose feet; jaläù—the water; dadhati—turn; sakåt—even once; manaù—their minds; tvayi—toward You; ye—who; ätmani—toward the Supreme Soul; nitya—always; sukhe—who is happy; na punaù—never again; upäsate—they worship; puruña—of a man; sära—the essential qualities; hara—which steal away; ävasathän—their mundane homes.
Sages free from false pride live on this earth by frequenting the sacred pilgrimage sites and those places where the Supreme Lord displayed His pastimes. Because such devotees keep Your lotus feet within their hearts, the water that washes their feet destroys all sins. Anyone who even once turns his mind toward You, the ever-blissful Soul of all existence, no longer dedicates himself to serving family life at home, which simply robs a man of his good qualities.
The qualification of an aspiring sage is that he has learned about the Absolute Truth from standard authorities and developed a sober mood of renunciation. To develop his capacity for discriminating the important from the unimportant, such a person often wanders from one holy site to another, taking advantage of the association of great souls who frequent or reside in these places. If, in the course of his travels, the aspiring sage can begin to realize the Supreme Lord's lotus feet in the core of his heart, he will be released from the illusion of false ego and from the painful bondage of lust, envy and greed. Though he may still go to places of pilgrimage to bathe away his sins, the now purified sage has the power to sanctify others with the water that washes his feet and with the realized instructions he imparts. Such a sage is described by the Muëòaka Upaniñad (2.2.9):
bhidyate hådaya-granthiç
chidyante sarva-saàçayäù
kñéyante cäsya karmäëi
tasmin dåñöe parävare
"The knot in the heart is pierced, all misgivings are cut to pieces, and the chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the Supreme Lord everywhere, within all superior and inferior beings." To sages who have reached this stage, the Muëòaka Upaniñad (3.2.11) thus pays homage: namaù paramarñibhyaù, namaù paramarñibhyaù. "Obeisances to the topmost sages, obeisances to the topmost sages!"
Putting aside the affectionate company of wives, children, friends and followers, saintly Vaiñëavas travel to the holy dhämas where the Supreme Lord's worship can be most successfully prosecuted—places such as Våndävana, Mäyäpur and Jagannätha Puré, or anywhere else where sincere devotees of Lord Viñëu congregate. Even those Vaiñëavas who have not taken sannyäsa and still live at home or in their guru's äçrama, but who have once tasted just a drop of the sublime pleasure of devotional service, will also have little inclination to meditate on the pleasures of a materialistic family life, which robs a person of his discretion, determination, sobriety, tolerance and peace of mind.

"My dear Lord, when I will give up all sense gratification and engage incessantly in meditating upon You, and when I will take up residence in the hermitages of saintly devotees free from false pride, then I will become fully immersed in the inundation of nectar pouring from the devotees' lotus mouths as they chant sacred narrations about You. And then, O Lord Narahari, I will never again have to take a material body."

It may be proposed that this world is permanently real because it is generated from the permanent reality, but such an argument is subject to logical refutation. Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their material affairs. With their various meanings and implications, the learned words of Your Vedas bewilder all persons whose minds have been dulled by hearing the incantations of sacrificial rituals.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the Upaniñads teach that this created world is real but temporary. This is the understanding that devotees of Lord Viñëu adhere to. But there are also materialistic philosophers, like the proponents of Jaimini Åñi's Karma-mémäàsä, who claim that this world is the only reality and exists eternally. For Jaimini, the cycle of karmic action and reaction is perpetual, with no possibility of liberation into a different, transcendental realm. This viewpoint, however, is shown to be fallacious by a careful examination of the Upaniñadic mantras, which contain many descriptions of a higher, spiritual existence. For example, sad eva saumyedam agra äséd ekam evädvitéyam: "My dear boy, the Absolute Truth alone existed prior to this creation, one without a second." (Chändogya Upaniñad 6.2.1) Also, vijïänam änandaà brahma: "The supreme reality is divine knowledge and bliss." (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 3.9.34)
In this prayer of the personified Vedas, the materialists' argument is summed up in the words sata idam utthitaà sat: "The visible world is permanently real because it is generated from the permanent reality." In general, this argument goes, that which is produced from a certain thing is composed of that thing. For example, earrings and other ornaments made from gold share gold's substance. Thus, the Mémäàsä logicians conclude, since the world as we know it is a manifestation of an eternal reality, it is also eternally real. But the Sanskrit ablative expression sataù, "from the eternal reality," implies a definite separation of cause and effect. Therefore, what is created from sat, the permanent reality, must be significantly different from it—in other words, temporary. In this way the argument of the materialists is flawed because it proves just the opposite of what it is intended to prove (tarka-hatam), namely that the world as we know it is all that exists, that it is eternal, and that there is no separate, transcendental reality.
In defense, the Mémäàsakas may claim that they are not trying to prove nondifference per se, but rather trying to disprove the possibility of difference, or in other words, the possibility of any reality separate from the known world. This attempt to support the Mémäàsä argument is easily refuted by the phrase vyabhicarati kva ca: that is to say, there are counterexamples that deviate from the general rule. Sometimes, indeed, the source is very different from what it produces, as in the case of a man and his young son, or of a hammer and the destruction of a clay pot.
But, the Mémäàsakas reply, the creation of the universe is not the same kind of causation as your counterexamples: the father and the hammer are only efficient causes, whereas the sat is also this universe's ingredient cause. This reply is anticipated by the words kva ca måñä ("and sometimes the effect is illusory"). In the case of the false perception of a snake where there is a rope on the ground, the rope is the snake-illusion's ingredient cause, differing in many respects from the imagined snake, most obviously in its being real.
The Mémäàsakas once more rejoin: But the ingredient cause of the illusory snake is not just the rope by itself: it is the rope plus the observer's ignorance (avidyä). Since avidyä is not a substance, the snake it produces is called an illusion. Yet the same is true, the personified Vedas reply, in the case of the universe's creation from sat in conjunction with ignorance (tathobhaya-yuk); here the unreal element of illusion, Mäyä, is the living beings' misconception that their own bodies and other changing material forms are permanent.
But, rejoin the Mémäàsakas, our experience of this world is valid because the things we experience are useful for practical activity. If our experience were not valid, we could never be sure that our perceptions corresponded to the facts. We would be like a man who, despite exhaustive examination, would still have to suspect that a rope might be a snake. No, the çrutis here answer, the temporary configurations of matter are nonetheless an illusory imitation of the eternal spiritual reality, cleverly concocted to fulfill the conditioned living entities' desire for material activity (vyavahåtaye vikalpa iñitaù). The illusion of this world's permanence is sustained by a succession of blind men who learn the materialistic idea from their predecessors and pass on this illusion to their descendants. Anyone can see that an illusion often continues by the momentum of lingering mental impressions, even when its basis is no longer present. Thus throughout history blind philosophers have misled other blind men by convincing them of the absurd idea that they can reach perfection by engaging in mundane rituals. Foolish people may be willing to exchange counterfeit coins among one another, but a wise man knows that such money is useless for the practical business of buying food, medicine and other necessities. And if given in charity, counterfeit money will earn no pious credit.
But, say the Mémäàsakas, how can the sincere performer of Vedic rituals be a deluded fool, since the Saàhitäs and Brähmaëas of the Vedic scriptures establish that the fruits of karma are eternal? For example, akñayyaà ha vai cäturmäsya-yäjinaù su-kåtaà bhavati: "For one who observes the Cäturmäsya vows there arises inexhaustible good karma," and apäma somam amåta babhüma: "We have drunk the soma and become immortal." (Åg Veda 8.43.3)
The çrutis reply by pointing out that the Personality of Godhead's learned words, comprising the Vedas, bewilder those whose weak intelligence has been crushed by the weight of too much faith in karma. The specific word used here is uru-våttibhiù, which indicates that the Vedic mantras, with their confusing variety of meanings in the semantic modes of gauëa, lakñaëä and so on, protect their sublime mysteries from all but those who have faith in Lord Viñëu. The Vedas do not truly mean to say in their injunctions that the fruits of karma are eternal, but only indirectly describe in metaphors the praiseworthiness of regulated sacrifices. The Chändogya Upaniñad states in no uncertain terms that the results of ritual karma are impermanent: tad yatheha karma-cito lokaù kñéyate evam evämutra puëya-cito lokaù kñéyate. "Just as whatever benefit one works hard to attain in this world is eventually depleted, so whatever life one earns for oneself in the next world by his piety will also eventually end." (Chändogya Upaniñad 8.1.16) According to the testimony of numerous çruti-mantras, the entire material universe is but a temporary emanation of the Supreme Truth; the Muëòaka Upaniñad, for one, says:
yathorëa-näbhiù såjate gåhëate ca
yathä påthivyäm oñadhayaù sambhavanti
yathä sataù puruñät keça-lomäni
tathäkñarät sambhavatéha viçvam
"As a web is expanded and withdrawn by a spider, as plants grow from the earth, and as hair grows from a living person's head and body, so this universe is generated from the inexhaustible Supreme." (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.1.7)

"Although this world has arisen from You, who are the very substance of reality, it is not eternally real.

The actual, transcendental, nondual reality is Your supremely blissful personal kingdom. To that beautiful abode I offer my obeisances. O Lord Hari, to whom Goddess Indirä always bows down, I also bow to You. Therefore please never release me."

na—not; yat—because; idam—this (universe); agre—in the beginning; äsa—existed; na bhaviñyat—it will not exist; ataù—hence; nidhanät anu—after its annihilation; mitam—deduced; antarä—in the meantime; tvayi—within You; vibhäti—it appears; måñä—false; ekarase—whose experience of spiritual ecstasy is unchanging; ataù—thus; upaméyate—it is understood by comparison; draviëa—of material substance; jäti—in the categories; vikalpa—of the transformations; pathaiù—with the varieties; vitatha—contrary to fact; manaù—of the mind; viläsam—fantasy; åtam—real; iti—so; avayanti—think; abudhaù—the unintelligent.
Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe to the transformation of various material substances into diverse forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination is substantially real are less intelligent.
Having thus defeated all attempts of the ritualists to prove the substantial reality of material creation, the personified Vedas now present positive evidence to the contrary—that this world is unreal in that it is temporary. Before the creation of the universe and after its dissolution, only the spiritual reality of the Supreme Lord, along with His abode and entourage, continue to exist. The çrutis confirm this: ätmä va idam eka evägra äsét. "Prior to the creation of this universe, only the Self existed." (Aitareya Upaniñad 1.1) Näsad äsén no sad äsét tadäném: "At that time neither the subtle nor the gross aspects of matter were present." (Åg Veda 10.129.1)
One can understand the relativity of creation by an analogy. When basic materials like clay and metal are processed and shaped into various products, the created objects exist separately from the clay and metal only in name and form. The basic substance remains unchanged. Similarly, when the energies of the Supreme Lord are transformed into the known things of this world, these things exist separately from Him only in name and form. In the Chändogya Upaniñad (6.1.4-6), the sage Udälaka explains a similar analogy to his son: yathä saumyaikena måtpiëòena sarvaà mån-mayaà vijïätam syäd väcärambhaëaà vikäro nämadheyaà måttikety eva satyam. "For example, my dear boy, by understanding a single lump of clay one can understand everything made from clay. The existence of transformed products is only a creation of language, a matter of assigning designations: the clay alone is real."
In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence that the things of this world are eternal or substantial, while there is overwhelming evidence that they are temporary and conditioned by false designations. Therefore only the ignorant can take the imaginary permutations of matter to be real.

The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.
Although the jéva is pure spirit, qualitatively equal with the Supreme Lord, he is prone to being degraded by embracing the ignorance of material illusion. When he becomes entranced by the allurements of Mäyä, he accepts bodies and senses that are designed to let him indulge in forgetfulness. Produced from the raw material of Mäyä's three modes—goodness, passion and nescience—these bodies envelop the spirit soul in varieties of unhappiness, culminating in death and rebirth.
The Supreme Soul and the individual soul share the same spiritual nature, but the Supreme Soul cannot be entrapped by ignorance like His infinitesimal companion. Smoke may engulf the glow of a small molten sphere of copper, covering its light in darkness, but the vast globe of the sun will never suffer the same kind of eclipse. Mäyä, after all, is the Personality of Godhead's faithful maidservant, the outward expansion of His internal, Yogamäyä potency. Çré Närada Païcarätra thus states, in a conversation between Çruti and Vidyä,
asyä ävarika-çaktir
mahä-mäyäkhileçvaré
yayä mugdhaà jagat sarvaà
sarve dehäbhimäninaù
"The covering potency derived from her is Mahä-mäyä, the regulator of everything material. The entire universe becomes bewildered by her, and thus every living being falsely identifies with his material body."
Just as a snake casts aside his old skin, knowing that it is not part of his essential identity, so the Supreme Lord always avoids His external, material energy. There is no insufficiency or limit to any of His eightfold mystic opulences, consisting of aëimä (the power to become infinitesimal), mahimä (the ability to become infinitely large) and so on. Therefore, the shadow of material darkness has no scope for entering the domain of His unequaled, resplendent glories.
For the sake of those whose realization of spiritual life is only gradually awakening, the Upaniñads sometimes speak in general terms of ätmä or Brahman, not openly distinguishing the difference between the superior and inferior souls, the Paramätmä and jévätma. But often enough they describe this duality in unequivocal terms:
dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyä
samänaà våkñaà pariñasvajäte
tayor anyaù pippalaà svädv atty
anaçnann anyo 'bhicäkaçéti
"Two companion birds sit together in the shelter of the same pippala tree. One of them is relishing the taste of the tree's berries, while the other refrains from eating and instead watches over His friend." (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 4.6) In this analogy the two birds are the soul and the Supersoul, the tree is the body, and the taste of the berries are the varieties of sense pleasure.

Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts, for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a man who has totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who practice yoga only for sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next: from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they cannot reach.
A mere show of renunciation is not sufficient to gain a person entrance into the kingdom of God. One must undergo a thorough change of heart, symptomized by a complete lack of interest in the self-destructive habits of sense gratification, both gross and subtle. Not only must the true sage refrain from even thinking of illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, but he must also give up his desires for reputation and position. All together these demands add up to a formidable challenge but the fruits of true renunciation in Kåñëa consciousness are well worth a lifetime of endeavor.
The Muëòaka Upaniñad (3.2.2) confirms the statements of this verse: kämän yaù kämayate manyamänaù sa karmabhir jäyate tatra tatra. "Even a thoughtful renunciant, if he maintains any worldly desires, will be forced by his karmic reactions to take birth again and again in various circumstances." Philosophers and yogés work hard to become free from birth and death, but because they are unwilling to surrender their proud independence, their meditations are devoid of devotion to the Supreme Lord, and thus they fall short of the perfection of renunciation—pure love of God. This pure love is the only goal of a sincere Vaiñëava, and therefore he must vigilantly resist the natural temptations of profit, adoration and distinction, and also the impulse to merge into an all-consuming impersonal oblivion. As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.1.11),
anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà
jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam
änukülyena kåñëänu-
çélanaà bhaktir uttamä
 [Cc. Madhya 19.167]
"When first-class devotional service develops, one must be devoid of all material desires, knowledge obtained by monistic philosophy, and fruitive action. The devotee must constantly serve Kåñëa favorably, as Kåñëa desires."
For those who undergo rigorous yoga discipline only to please their senses, prolonged suffering is inevitable. Hunger, disease, the degeneration of old age, injury from accident, violence from others—these are a few of the limitless varieties of suffering one can experience to varying degrees in this world. And ultimately, death awaits, followed by painful punishment for sinful activities. Especially those who have freely indulged in sensual enjoyments at the cost of others' lives can expect punishment so severe it is unimaginable. But the greatest pain of material existence is not misfortune in this life or being sent to hell after death: it is the emptiness of having forgotten one's eternal relationship with the Personality of Godhead.

When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu's descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation.
Text 39 clearly states that impersonalistic renunciants will continue to suffer birth after birth. One may ask if this suffering is justified, since a renunciant's status should exempt him from suffering, whether or not he has a devotional attitude. As the çruti-mantra states, eña nityo mahimä brähmaëasya na karmaëä vardhate no kanéyän: "The perpetual glory of a brähmaëa is never increased or diminished as a result of any of his activities." (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 4.4.28) To counter the objection thus raised, the personified Vedas offer this prayer.
Impersonalistic jïanés and yogés do not qualify for full relief from the reactions of karma—a privilege reserved only for those who are tvad-avagamé, pure devotees constantly engaged in hearing and chanting topics concerning the Personality of Godhead. The devotees hold firm to the Supreme Lord's lotus feet by their unrelenting Kåñëa consciousness, and so they need not strictly adhere to the ritual commands and prohibitions of the Vedas. They can fearlessly ignore the apparent good and bad reactions of the work they do only for the Supreme Lord's pleasure, and they can equally ignore whatever others may say about them, whether praise or condemnation. A humble Vaiñëava absorbed in the pleasure of saìkértana, glorification of the Lord, pays little heed to praise of himself, which he assumes mistaken, and happily accepts all criticism, which he deems appropriate.
One receives the authorized chanting of the Supreme Lord's glories by faithfully hearing from "the sons of Manu," the disciplic succession of saintly Vaiñëavas coming down through the ages. These sages emulate well the example of Sväyambhuva Manu, the forefather of mankind:
ayäta-yämäs tasyäsan
yämäù sväntara-yäpanäù
çåëvato dhyäyato viñëoù
kurvato bruvataù kathäù
"Although Sväyambhuva's life gradually came to an end, his long life, consisting of a manv-antara era, was not spent in vain, since he always engaged in hearing, contemplating, writing down and chanting the pastimes of the Lord." (SB 3.22.35)
Even if a neophyte devotee falls from the standards of proper behavior by the force of his past bad habits, the all-merciful Lord will not reject him. As Lord Çré Kåñëa states,
tair ahaà püjanéyo vai

Even if Kali [the present age of quarrel] has them in his grip, they still get credit for living in this place. My devotee who lives in Mathurä is just as dear to Me as you [Brahmä] and your sons—Rudra and his followers—and Goddess Çré and My own self."

dyu—of heaven; patayaù—the masters; eva—even; te—Your; na yayuù—cannot reach; antam—the end; anantatayä—because of being unlimited; tvam—You; api—even; yat—whom; antara—within; aëòa—of universes; nicayäù—multitudes; nanu—indeed; sa—along with; ävaranäù—their outer shells; khe—in the sky; iva—as; rajäàsi—particles of dust; vänti—blow about; vayasä saha—with the wheel of time; yat—because; çrutayaù—the Vedas; tvayi—in You; hi—indeed; phalanti—bear fruit; atat—of that which is distinct from the Absolute Truth; nirasanena—by the elimination; bhavat—in You; nidhanäù—whose ultimate conclusion.
Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The çrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion.
Now, in their last prayer, the personified Vedas draw the conclusion that all çrutis, by their various literal and metaphorical references, ultimately describe the Supreme Personality of Godhead's identity, personal qualities and powers. The Upaniñads glorify Him without end: yad ürdhvaà gärgi divo yad arväk påthivyä yad antarä dyävä-påthivé ime yad bhütaà bhavac ca bhaviñyac ca. "My dear daughter of Garga, His greatness encompasses everything above us in heaven, everything below the surface of the earth, everything in between heaven and earth, and everything that has ever existed, exists now or will ever exist." (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 3.8.4)
To illuminate the meaning of this final prayer by the çrutis, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura presents the following conversation between Lord Näräyaëa and the personified Vedas: The Vedas said, "Lord Brahmä and the other rulers of the heavenly planets have not yet reached the end of Your glories. What can we do, then, since we are insignificant in comparison to these great demigods?"
Lord Näräyaëa replied, "No, you çrutis are gifted with more sublime vision than the demigods who rule this universe. You will be able to reach the end of My glories if you do not stop now."
"But even You cannot find Your own limit!"
"If that is the case, what do you mean when you call Me omniscient and omnipotent?"
"We conclude that You possess these features from the very fact that You are limitless. Certainly if one is ignorant of something that does not even exist, like a rabbit's horn, that does not detract from his omniscience, and if one fails to find such a nonentity, that does not limit his omnipotence. You are so vast that multitudes of universes float within You. Each of these universes is surrounded by seven shells composed of the material elements and each of these concentric shells is ten times larger than the one within it. Although we can never fully describe the truth about You, we perfect our existence by declaring that You are the true topic of the Vedas."
"But why do you seem dissatisfied?"
"Because in the Vedas Çréla Vyäsadeva has described the transcendental existence of Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän only briefly. When he saw the need to elaborate on his description of the Supreme, he chose to concentrate on the subject of Brahman, the impersonal aspect of the Supreme known as tat ("that") explaining Brahman by negating whatever is different from it. Just as in a field where a chest of jewels has been accidentally spilled the jewels can be recovered by removing unwanted stones, twigs and refuse, so within the visible realm of Mäyä and her creations the Absolute Truth can be found by a process of elimination. Since we Vedas cannot possibly enumerate every material category, individual entity, quality and motion in the universe from the beginning to the end of time, and since the truth concerning Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän would still remain untouched even if we described all these things and then discarded them, by this means of investigation we never expect to reach a final definition of You. Only by Your mercy can we make some attempt to approach You, the supremely inaccessible Absolute Truth."
There are many statements of çruti that carry on the work of atan-nirasanam, the process of distinguishing the Supreme from everything inferior. The Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (3.8.8), for example, states, asthülam anaëu ahrasvam adérgham alohitam asneham acchäyam atamo 'väyv anäkäçam asaìgam arasam agandham acakñuñkam açrotram agamano 'tejaskam apräëam asukham amätram anantaram abähyam. "It is neither big nor small, short nor long, hot nor cool, in shadow nor in darkness. Nor is it the wind or the ether. It is not in contact with anything, and it has no taste, smell, eyes, ears, motion, potency, life air, pleasure, measurement, inside or outside. "The Kena Upaniñad (3) declares, anyad eva tad viditäd atho aviditäd adhi: "Brahman is distinct from what is known and also from what is yet to be known." And the Kaöha Upaniñad (2.14) says, anyatra dharmäd anyaträdharmäd anyaträsmät kåtäkåtät: "Brahman is outside the scope of religion and irreligion, pious and impious action."
According to the rules of linguistics and logic, a negation cannot be unbounded: there must be some positive counterpart of which it is the negation. In the case of the Vedas' exhaustive atan-nirasanam, their denial that anything material is absolutely real, the counterpart is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé prays,
dyu-patayo vidur antam ananta te
na ca bhavän na giraù çruti-maulayaù
tvayi phalanti yato nama ity ato
jaya jayeti bhaje tava tat-padam
"The gods of heaven do not know Your limit, O endless Lord, and even You do not know it. Because the transcendental words of the topmost çrutis become fruitful by revealing You, I offer You my obeisances. Thus I worship You as the Absolute Truth, saying 'All glories to You! All glories to You!'"

As explained by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the secret import of these words spoken for Arjuna's edification is as follows: "You two, who have descended along with your kaläs, your personal energies, should kindly return to Me after killing the demons who burden the earth. Please quickly send these demons here to Me for the sake of their liberation." It is stated in Çré Hari-vaàça and in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the path of gradual liberation passes through the intermediate station of Lord Mahä-Viñëu's abode, outside the eighth shell of the universe.

The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord Kåñëa's feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated Kåñëa and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?
From beginning to end, the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam has been exclusively dedicated to reciting the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa in Våndävana, Mathurä and Dvärakä. As Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out, this verse sums up the Tenth Canto by mentioning five special glories of Çré Kåñëa that even His expansions, plenary portions and incarnations do not display.
First, Lord Kåñëa's reputation eclipsed that of the holy Ganges when He descended into the Yadu dynasty. Previous to this, mother Ganges was the most sacred of all térthas, being the water that had bathed Lord Vämanadeva's lotus feet. Another river, the Yamunä, became even greater than the Ganges by contacting the dust from Çré Kåñëa's feet in the districts of Vraja and Mathurä:
gaìgä-çata-guëä präyo
mäthure mama maëòale
yamunä viçrutä devi
nätra käryä vicäraëä
"The renowned Yamunä in My domain of Mathurä is hundreds of times greater than the Ganges. About this there can be no dispute, O goddess." (Varäha Puräëa)
Second, Lord Kåñëa gave liberation not only to His surrendered devotees but also to those who considered themselves His enemies. Devotees like the cowherd girls of Vraja and others attained His personal association by entering into His eternal pleasure pastimes in the spiritual world, while inimical demons killed by Him attained the säyujya-mukti of merging into His divine form. When He was present on this earth, Lord Kåñëa's compassion extended to His family, friends and servants, and also to His enemies and their families, friends and servants. Great authorities like Lord Brahmä have mentioned this fact: sad-veñäd iva pütanäpi sa-kulä tväm eva deväpitä. "My Lord, You have already given Yourself to Pütanä and her family members simply because she dressed herself as a devotee." (SB 10.14.35)
Third, Goddess Lakñmé, Lord Näräyaëa's constant companion, whom great demigods serve menially to win her slight favor, was unable to win the privilege of joining the intimate company of Lord Kåñëa's devotees in Vraja. Despite her eagerness to participate in the räsa dance and other pastimes enacted by Çré Kåñëa, and despite the severe austerities she underwent to achieve that end, she could not transcend her natural mood of reverence. The sweetness and intimacy Lord Kåñëa manifested in Våndävana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaikuëöha. As Çré Uddhava says,
yan martya-lélaupayikaà sva-yoga-
mäyä-balaà darçayatä gåhétam
vismäpanaà svasya ca saubhagarddheù
paraà padaà bhüñaëa-bhüñaëäìgam
"To exhibit the strength of His spiritual potency, Lord Kåñëa manifested a form just suitable for His humanlike pastimes in the material world. This form was wonderful even for Him and was the supreme abode of the wealth of good fortune. Its limbs were so beautiful that they increased the beauty of the ornaments worn on different parts of His body." (SB 3.2.12)
Fourth, the name Kåñëa is superior to the name Näräyaëa and to those of all of Lord Kåñëa's other expansions. These two syllables—kåñ and ëa—combine together to destroy all inauspiciousness and illusion. When recited, the name Kåñëa becomes çruta-matha; that is to say, the recitation of Kåñëa's name totally crushes (mathnäti) the excellence of all other spiritual practices described in the revealed scriptures (çruta). In the words of the Brahmäëda Puräëa,
sahasra-nämnäà puëyänäà
trir ävåttyä tu yat phalam
ekävåttyä tu kåñëasya
nämaikaà tat prayacchati
"By uttering the single name of Kåñëa just once, one attains the same benefit as that gained by reciting Lord Viñëu's thousand names three times."
Fifth, Lord Kåñëa solidly reinstated dharma, the bull of religion, on his four legs of compassion, austerity, cleanliness and truth. Thus dharma could once again become go-tra, the protector of the earth. Çré Kåñëa also established the religious function of Govardhana-püjä to honor His favorite hill, the cows and the brähmaëas. He also became the hill (gotra) Himself, assuming its form to accept the cowherds' offerings. Moreover, He cultivated the dharma, or loving nature, of Vraja's divine cowherds (gotras), whose love for Him has never been equaled.
These are just a few of the wonderful features of Lord Kåñëa's unique personality.

Therefore devaké-janma-vada means that He is known as the son of Devaké. Similarly, He is also known as the son of Mother Yaçodä, Vasudeva and Nanda Mahäräja.); yadu-vara-pariñat—served by the members of the Yadu dynasty or the cowherd men of Våndävana (all of whom are constant associates of the Supreme Lord and are the Lord's eternal servants); svaiù dorbhiù—by His own arms, or by His devotees like Arjuna who are just like His own arms; asyan—killing; adharmam—demons or the impious; sthira-cara-våjina-ghnaù—the destroyer of all the ill fortune of all living entities, moving and not moving; su-smita—always smiling; çré-mukhena—by His beautiful face; vraja-pura-vanitänäm—of the damsels of Våndävana; vardhayan—increasing; käma-devam—the lusty desires.
Lord Çré Kåñëa is He who is known as jana-niväsa, the ultimate resort of all living entities, and who is also known as Devakénandana or Yaçodä-nandana, the son of Devaké and Yaçodä. He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious. By His presence He destroys all things inauspicious for all living entities, moving and inert. His blissful smiling face always increases the lusty desires of the gopés of Våndävana. May He be all glorious and happy!
The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Çréla Prabhupäda's English rendering of Çré Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 13.79). 
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé has composed this beautiful verse to console those who lament the fact that Lord Kåñëa did not continue to manifest His intimate pastimes down to the present time. Here Çré Çukadeva reminds his listeners that the Lord is eternally present in this world—in His holy abode, His name and the recitation of His glories. This idea is expressed by the word jayati ("He is victorious"), which is in the present tense rather than the past.
Çréla Prabhupäda explains this verse as follows in Kåñëa: "Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé thus concludes his description of the superexalted position of Lord Kåñëa by glorifying Him in the following way: 'O Lord Kåñëa, all glories unto You. You are present in everyone's heart as Paramätmä. Therefore You are known as Jananiväsa, one who lives in everyone's heart.' As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä, éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati: 'The Supreme Lord in His Paramätmä feature lives within everyone's heart.' This does not mean, however, that Kåñëa has no separate existence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mäyävädé philosophers accept the all-pervading feature of Para-brahman, but when Para-brahman, or the Supreme Lord, appears, they think that He appears under the control of material nature. Because Lord Kåñëa appeared as the son of Devaké, the Mäyävädé philosophers accept Kåñëa to be an ordinary living entity who takes birth within this material world. Therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé warns them: devaké-janma-väda, which means that although Kåñëa is famous as the son of Devaké, actually He is the Supersoul, or the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees, however, take this word devaké-janma-väda in a different way. The devotees understand that actually Kåñëa was the son of Mother Yaçodä. Although Kåñëa first appeared as the son of Devaké, He immediately transferred Himself to the lap of Mother Yaçodä, and His childhood pastimes were blissfully enjoyed by Mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja. This fact was admitted by Vasudeva himself when he met Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä at Kurukñetra. He admitted that Kåñëa and Balaräma were actually the sons of Mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja. Vasudeva and Devaké were only Their official father and mother. Their actual father and mother were Nanda and Yaçodä. Therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé describes Lord Kåñëa as devaké-janma-väda.
"Çukadeva Gosvämé then glorifies the Lord as one who is honored by the yadu-vara-pariñat, the assembly house of the Yadu dynasty, and as the killer of different kinds of demons. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have killed all the demons by employing His different material energies, but He wanted to kill them personally, to give them salvation. There was no need of Kåñëa's coming to this material world to kill the demons; simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with Mother Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dvärakä. By killing the demons and giving protection to the devotees, Lord Kåñëa established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By following the factual religious principle of love of God, even the living entities known as sthira-cara were also delivered of all material contamination and transferred to the spiritual kingdom. Sthira means the trees and plants, which cannot move, and cara means the moving animals, especially the cows. When Kåñëa was present, He delivered all the trees, monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and serve Him, both in Våndävana and in Dvärakä.
"Lord Kåñëa is especially glorified for giving pleasure to the gopés and the queens of Dvärakä. Çukadeva Gosvämé glorifies Lord Kåñëa for His enchanting smile, by which He enchanted not only the gopés of Våndävana but also the queens of Dvärakä. The exact words used in this connection are vardhayan käma-devam. In Våndävana, as the boyfriend of many gopés, and in Dvärakä, as the husband of many queens, Kåñëa increased their lusty desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the gopés and the queens of Dvärakä, simply by enhancing their lusty desires to enjoy Kåñëa as their boyfriend or husband, received the highest type of salvation."
In this way Çréla Prabhupäda wonderfully illuminates the meaning of this verse by Çukadeva Gosvämé, which summarizes Lord Kåñëa's pastimes.

To protect the principles of devotional service to Himself, Lord Kåñëa, the best of the Yadus, accepts the pastime forms that have been glorified here in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. One who desires to faithfully serve His lotus feet should hear of the activities He performs in each of these incarnations—activities that suitably imitate those of the forms He assumes. Hearing narrations of these pastimes destroys the reactions to fruitive work.

By regularly hearing, chanting and meditating on the beautiful topics of Lord Mukunda with ever-increasing sincerity, a mortal being will attain the divine kingdom of the Lord, where the inviolable power of death holds no sway. For this purpose, many persons, including great kings, abandoned their mundane homes and took to the forest.
For the Çrémad-Bhägavatam's Tenth Canto, this verse is the phala-çruti, the promise of success given to one who hears it. The process of devotional service begins with hearing topics about the Supreme Lord. When one has heard these topics properly, he can then proceed to chant them for others' benefit and reflect on their significance. This leads to faithful adherence to the principles of devotional service, which culminates in absolute faith in Lord Kåñëa. Such perfect faith gives one the right to enter the Lord's intimate service and, in due course of time, return to one's eternal, spiritual life in one of the Lord's personal domains.
Humbly offering his comments on the Tenth Canto at the lotus feet of his worshipable Lord, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté prays,
mad-gavér api gopälaù

"If Lord Gopäla mercifully accepts the cows of my words, then His dear devotees may enjoy the pleasure of drinking their milk—the nectar produced by hearing them."
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Ninetieth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Summary of Lord Kåñëa's Glories."
The Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam was completed on December 27, 1988, the anniversary of Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's disappearance.

The demigods, headed by Kämadeva, or Cupid, recognizing their offense at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, here point out the insignificant position of the demigods in relation to the Supreme Lord. Just as a farmer must pay a specific percentage of his agricultural profit to the king or political head as tax money, all human beings must offer a percentage of their material wealth to the demigods in sacrifice. In the Bhagavad-gétä however, the Lord explains that the demigods are also His servants and it is He Himself who awards all benedictions, through the agency of the demigods. Mayaiva vihitän hi tän. Although a Vaiñëava, or devotee of the Lord, has no need to worship the demigods, the demigods, being proud of their exalted material position, sometimes resent the exclusive devotion of the Vaiñëava to the Lord and thus try to cause the devotee to fall down, as described in this verse (sura-kåtä bahavo 'ntaräyäù). But the demigods here point out that Kåñëa is directly the protector of His devotees. Therefore, so-called impediments become stimuli for further spiritual advancement for a sincere devotee.
The demigods here state, "We thought, our dear Lord, that we could disturb Your consciousness by our foolish tricks. But by Your mercy even Your devotees pay little regard to us, so why should You take our foolish behavior seriously?" The word yadi here is used to indicate the certainty that Kåñëa is always the protector of His surrendered devotees. Although there may be many obstacles on the path of the sincere devotee who is preaching the glories of the Lord, such obstacles increase the determination of the devotee. Therefore, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the continuous obstacles presented by the demigods form a kind of ladder or stairway upon which the devotee steadily progresses back to the kingdom of God. A similar verse appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.2.33):
tathä na te mädhava tävakäù kvacid
bhraçyanti märgät tvayi baddha-sauhådäù
tvayäbhiguptä vicaranti nirbhayä
vinäyakänékapa-mürdhasu prabho
"O Mädhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service."

kñut—hunger; tåö—thirst; tri-käla-guëa—the manifestations of the three phases of time (such as heat and cold, rain and so on); märuta—wind; jaihva—enjoyment of the tongue; çaiçnyän—and of the genitals; asmän—ourselves (in all these forms); apära—limitless; jala-dhén—oceans; atitérya—having crossed over; kecit—some persons; krodhasya—of anger; yänti—they come; viphalasya—which is fruitless; vaçam—under the sway; pade—in the foot(print); goù—of a cow; majjanti—they drown; duçcara—difficult to execute; tapaù—their austerities; ca—and; våthä—without any good purpose; utsåjanti—they throw away.
Some men practice severe penances to cross beyond our influence, which is like an immeasurable ocean with endless waves of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and the other conditions brought about by the passing of time, such as the sensuous wind and the urges of the tongue and sex organs. Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.
Those who do not accept the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can be considered in two categories. Those engaged in sense gratification are easily conquered by the demigods through various weapons such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, lamentation for the past and vain hoping for the future. Such materialistic fools, infatuated with the material world, are easily controlled by the demigods, who are the ultimate supplying agents of sense gratification. But according to Çrédhara Svämé, persons who attempt to subdue the desires of the material senses and thus avoid the control of the demigods without surrendering to the Supreme Lord are even more foolish than the sense gratifiers. Although crossing the ocean of sense gratification, those who perform severe penances without service to the Lord eventually drown in tiny puddles of anger. One who simply performs material penances does not actually purify his heart. By one's material determination one may restrict the activities of the senses although one's heart is still filled with material desires. The practical result of this is krodha, or anger. We have seen artificial performers of penance who have become very bitter and angry through denial of the senses. Being indifferent to the Supreme Lord, such persons do not achieve ultimate liberation, nor can they enjoy material sense gratification; rather, they become angry, and through cursing others or enjoying false pride they uselessly exhaust the results of their painful austerities. It is understood that when a yogé curses he diminishes the mystic power he has accumulated. Thus, anger gives neither liberation nor material sense gratification but merely burns up all the results of material penances and austerities. Being useless, such anger is compared to a useless puddle found in a cow's hoofprint. Thus after crossing over the ocean of sense gratification the great yogés who are indifferent to the Supreme Lord drown in puddles of anger. Although the demigods admit that the devotees of the Lord actually conquer the miseries of material life, it is understood here that a similar result is not to be obtained by so-called yogés who are not interested in devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

çré-deväù ücuù—the demigods said; natäù sma—we are bowed down; te—Your; nätha—O Lord; pada-aravindam—to the lotus feet; buddhi—with our intelligence; indriya—senses; präëa—vital air; manaù—mind; vacobhiù—and words; yat—which; cintyate—are meditated upon; antaù hådi—within the heart; bhäva-yuktaiù—who are fixed in yoga practice; mumukñubhiù—by those striving for liberation; karma-maya—of the reactions of fruitive work; uru-päçät—from the great bondage.
The demigods began to speak: Our dear Lord, advanced mystic yogis, striving for liberation from the severe bondage of material work, meditate with great devotion upon Your lotus feet within their hearts. Dedicating our intelligence, senses, vital air, mind and power of speech to Your Lordship, we demigods bow down at Your lotus feet.
According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word sma in this verse indicates vismaya, "astonishment." The demigods were astonished that although great mystic yogés are only able to contemplate the lotus feet of the Lord within their hearts, the demigods arriving in the city of Dvärakä were able to see before them the entire body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the powerful demigods fell down like sticks before the Lord. Such full obeisances (called daëòavat, "like a stick") are described as follows:
dorbhyäà padäbhyäà jänubhyäm
urasä çirasä dåçä
manasä vacasä ceti
praëämo 'ñöäìga éritaù
"The obeisances offered with eight limbs are made with the two arms, the two legs, the two knees, the chest, the head, the eyes, the mind and the power of speech.''
The currents of material nature are very powerful, and one should therefore cling tightly to the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise, the violent waves of sense gratification and mental speculation will undoubtedly sweep one away from one's eternal, constitutional position as the loving servitor of the Supreme Lord, and one will then fall down into the stringent bondage described here as uru-päçät, "a very powerful illusory network."

tvam—You; mäyayä—by the material energy; tri-guëayä—made up of the three modes of nature; ätmani—within Yourself; durvibhävyam—inconceivable; vyaktam—the manifest cosmos; såjasi—You create; avasi—protect; lumpasi—and destroy; tat—of that material nature; guëa—within the modes (goodness, passion and ignorance); sthaù—situated; na—not; etaiù—by these; bhavän—You; ajita—O unconquerable Lord; karmabhiù—activities; ajyate—are entangled; vai—at all; yat—because; sve—in Your own; sukhe—happiness; avyavahite—unimpeded; abhirataù—You are always absorbed; anavadyaù—the unimpeachable Lord.
O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain and devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent of mäyä, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never affected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal spiritual bliss, and thus You cannot be accused of any material infection.
The word durvibhävyam is significant here. The ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world is certainly inconceivable even for the greatest mundane scientists, who waste their lives in useless and fruitless speculation. Yet Mahä-Viñëu, who is the secondary expansion of an expansion of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, sees the entire cosmos to be like an insignificant atom. So what hope is there for foolish so-called scientists who try to understand Kåñëa by their ridiculous experimental power? Thus the word anavadya is used. No one can find fault or discrepancy in the body, character, activities or instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is never materially ignorant; therefore He never exhibits cruelty, laziness, foolishness, blindness or material intoxication. Similarly, because the Lord is never polluted by material passion, He never exhibits material pride, lamentation, yearning or violence. And since the Lord is free from material goodness, He never attempts to peacefully enjoy the material world with a sublime materialistic mentality.
Lord Kåñëa, as stated here (sve sukhe 'vyavahite 'bhirataù), is eternally busy, day and night, in His transcendental abode, relishing the inconceivable loving devotion of His innumerable associates. The Lord is being embraced and is embracing. He is joking and is hearing the joking of His loved ones. The Lord is walking through forests full of fruits and flowers, playing in the nectarean river Yamunä and taking part in His most confidential transcendental loving affairs with the cowherd girls of Våndävana. These pastimes in Kåñëaloka and on other Vaikuëöha planets are eternal, faultless and an ocean of spiritual happiness. The Lord never descends to the dry platform of relative material happiness. The infinite Personality of Godhead has nothing to gain from anyone; thus fruitive activity cannot possibly exist within the Lord.

O worshipable Lord, those whose consciousness is polluted by illusion may try to purify themselves by ordinary worship, study of the Vedas, charity, austerity and ritual activities, but the purification they achieve is never as great as that attained by those pure souls who have developed a powerful transcendental faith in Your glories by regularly hearing them, O greatest of all.
Even if a pure devotee is lacking the above qualifications, such as Vedic study and austerity, if he has unflinching faith in Lord Kåñëa the Lord will save him because of his devotion. On the other hand, if one becomes falsely proud of one's material qualifications, including ordinary piety, but does not devote himself to hearing and chanting the glories of Kåñëa, the result will ultimately be nil. The transcendental spirit soul cannot be purified by any amount of material piety, charity or scholarship. Only the transcendental Supreme Lord can purify the transcendental living entity by bestowing His mercy within the heart. The demigods were astonished at their good fortune. Even by hearing about Kåñëa, one achieves all perfection, but they had entered the Lord's own city and were seeing Him standing before them,

Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. May Your lotus feet become the blazing fire that burns to ashes all our inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.
The conditioned living entity can purify his existence simply by having firm faith in the transcendental glories of the Personality of Godhead. What then can be said of the extraordinary good fortune of the demigods, who were directly seeing Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet? Although we are presently afflicted by innumerable material desires, these desires are temporary. The eternal living entity is meant to experience a loving relationship with the supreme living entity, the Personality of Godhead; and the heart of the living entity who renders the Lord pure devotional service is completely satisfied.
The word dhümaketu in this verse indicates a flaming comet or fire, which represents Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is the master of the mode of ignorance, and Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are compared to the comet, a symbol of the potency of Çiva, which can destroy all ignorance within the heart. The word sama-vibhütaye ("for achieving equal opulence") indicates that the pure devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and enjoy the infinite bliss of the spiritual world. Lord Kåñëa is endowed with unlimited opulent paraphernalia for enjoyment, and a liberated soul who goes to Kåñëa's abode is awarded all opulence for serving the Lord. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the word vyühe in this verse indicates the three puruña incarnations, namely Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, as well as Väsudeva. If we can scientifically understand how Kåñëa expands Himself to create the material world, we shall immediately experience that everything is the property of Kåñëa and thus become free from the desire to exploit it for our own selfish purposes. Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, the master of everyone and the reservoir of all opulences, and one should remember His lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. One who always remembers Kåñëa and never forgets Him will experience real, blissful life beyond the pale shadow of material illusion.

yaù—which; cintyate—are meditated upon; prayata-päëibhiù—by those with folded hands; adhvara-agnau—in the fire of sacrifice; trayyä—of the three Vedas (Åg, Yajur and Säma); nirukta—comprising the essential understanding presented in the Nirukta; vidhinä-by the process; éça-O Lord; haviù—the ghee meant for offering; gåhétvä—taking; adhyätma-yoge—in that yoga system meant for realization of one's true self; uta—also; yogibhiù—by the practitioners of this yoga; ätma-mäyäm—about Your bewildering material energy; jijïäsubhiù—who are inquisitive; parama-bhägavataiù—by the most elevated devotees; paréñöaù—perfectly worshiped.
Those about to offer oblations into the fire of sacrifice in accordance with the Åg, Yajur and Säma Vedas meditate on Your lotus feet. Similarly, the practitioners of transcendental yoga meditate upon Your lotus feet, hoping for knowledge about Your divine mystic potency, and the most elevated pure devotees perfectly worship Your lotus feet, desiring to cross beyond Your illusory potency.
The words ätma-mäyäà jijïäsubhiù are significant in this verse. The mystic yogés (adhyätma-yoga uta yogibhiù) are eager to acquire knowledge of the Lord's mystic potencies, whereas the pure devotees (parama-bhägavataiù) are eager to cross beyond the kingdom of illusion so that they can serve Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet in pure loving ecstasy. In any case, everyone is interested in the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheistic material scientists are also fascinated by the external material potency of the Lord, and the gross sense gratifiers are attracted by the physical body, which is also ätma-mäyä, or an expansion of the Lord's potency. Although all of the Lord's potencies are qualitatively one with the Lord, and therefore with each other, the blissful spiritual potency is nevertheless supreme because it establishes relationships between the Lord and the pure living entities on the platform of eternal happiness. Every living entity is originally a loving servitor of the Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord engages the living entity in his pure constitutional position beyond illusion.
Our dreaming and waking experiences are both activities of the mind; however, the activities we perform while awake are more valuable because they establish us in our permanent situation. Similarly, at every moment every living entity is experiencing one of the innumerable potencies of the Supreme Lord. However, the experience of the spiritual potency is more significant because it establishes the living entity in his eternal, constitutional position as a faithful servitor of the Personality of Godhead.
The demigods are glorifying the Lord's lotus feet because they are personally very eager to be purified by contact with those feet, as they state in the previous verse: syän nas taväìghrir açubhäçaya-dhümaketuù. When a sincere devotee eagerly desires to attain the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, the Lord brings him to His personal abode, just as the demigods were brought to Dvärakä by Lord Kåñëa's arrangement.

O almighty Lord, You are so kind to Your servants that You have accepted the withered flower garland that we have placed on Your chest. Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lakñmé and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.
In the Bhagavad-gétä (9.26) it is stated:
patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà
yo me bhaktyä prayacchati
tad ahaà bhakty-upahåtam
açnämi prayatätmanaù
Lord Kåñëa gratefully and happily accepts even the most meager offering from His loving devotee. Lord Kåñëa is conquered by the love of His pure devotees, just as a father is easily conquered by the most insignificant gift offered by his loving child. Unless a transcendentalist completely gives up the impersonal conception of life, he cannot make such a loving offering to the Lord. The process of meditation upon the Supersoul within the heart, called dhyäna-yoga, is not as pleasing to Kåñëa as bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, because in dhyäna, or meditation, the yogé is trying to satisfy himself (and not the Lord) by attaining mystic powers. Similarly, in order to acquire material benefits from the Lord, ordinary people worship God in temples, churches and mosques. But one who desires actual spiritual perfection must be enlivened to always chant and hear the glories of the Lord. Such devotional enthusiasm is motivated by love of Godhead and is devoid of any selfish expectation.
The Lord is so kind that He neglects His own eternal consort, Lakñmé, and gives preference to His humble devotee, just as a man will neglect the loving embrace of his wife when his affectionate child approaches him with a gift. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that any garland worn by the Lord cannot be faded because all of the Lord's personal paraphernalia is completely transcendental and spiritually opulent. Similarly, there is no possibility that mundane jealousy could appear in the character of the goddess of fortune, who is as transcendental as Lord Kåñëa Himself. Therefore the statements of the demigods are to be understood as humorous words inspired by intense love of Godhead. The demigods enjoy the protection of Lakñmé and, ultimately, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and due to their confidence in their loving relationship with the Lord and His consort they feel free to speak in a joking way.

O omnipotent Lord, in Your incarnation as Trivikrama, You raised Your leg like a flagpole to break the shell of the universe, allowing the holy Ganges to flow down, like a banner of victory, in three branches throughout the three planetary systems. By three mighty steps of Your lotus feet, Your Lordship captured Bali Mahäräja, along with his universal kingdom. Your lotus feet inspire fear in the demons by driving them down to hell and fearlessness among Your devotees by elevating them to the perfection of heavenly life. We are sincerely trying to worship You, our Lord; therefore may Your lotus feet kindly free us from all of our sinful reactions.
In order to reclaim for the demigods the universal kingdom seized by Bali Mahäräja, Lord Kåñëa, as described in the Eighth Canto of this great work, appeared as the beautiful dwarf brähmaëa Vämana, who extended His foot upward to the outer limits of the universe. When the Lord's leg breached a hole in the universal shell, the holy Ganges water came flowing into the universe.

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the transcendental entity who is superior to both material nature and the enjoyer of nature. May Your lotus feet bestow transcendental pleasure upon us. All of the great demigods, beginning with Brahmä, are embodied living entities. Struggling painfully with one another under the strict control of Your time factor, they are just like bulls dragged by ropes tied through their pierced noses.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé states: nanu yuddhe deväsurädayaù parasparaà jayanti jéyante ca kim ahaà tatrety ata ähuù, naséti. mithur mitho 'rdyamänä yuddhädibhiù péòyamänä brahmädayo 'pi yasya tava vaçe bhavanti na tu jaye paräjaye vä svatanträù. "In the perpetual battles between the demigods, or devotees of the Lord, and the demons, or nondevotees, each side sometimes conquers and is sometimes apparently defeated. One may argue that all this has nothing to do with the Personality of Godhead since it is based on nothing more than the interaction of opposing living entities. But every living entity is, however, strictly under the control of the Personality of Godhead, and victory and defeat are always in the hands of the Lord." This does not contradict the fact of the living entity's free will, since the Lord awards victory and defeat according to the merit of the living entities. In a legal battle neither the prosecution nor the defense can act independently of the legal system presided over by the authorized judge. Victory and defeat in the court are awarded by the judge, but the judge is acting according to the laws, which do not favor or discriminate against either side.
Similarly, the Personality of Godhead is awarding us the results of our previous activities. In order to discredit God, materialists frequently give the argument that oftentimes innocent people suffer whereas impious rogues enjoy life unimpeded. The fact is, however, that the Personality of Godhead is not a fool, as are the materialistic persons who place such arguments. The Lord can see our many previous lives; therefore He may allow one to enjoy or suffer in this life not only as a result of one's present activities, but also as a result of one's previous activities. For example, by working very hard a man may accumulate a fortune. If such a newly rich man then gives up his work and takes to a degenerate life, his fortune does not immediately disappear. On the other hand, one who is destined to become rich may now be working very hard, with discipline and austerity, and yet be without spending money. So a superficial observer might well be confused upon seeing the moral, hard-working man without funds and the degenerate, lazy man in possession of riches. Similarly, a materialistic fool without knowledge of past, present and future is unable to understand the perfect justice of the Personality of Godhead.
The example given in this verse to explain Kåñëa's controlling power is appropriate. Although a bull is extremely powerful, he is easily controlled by a slight tug on a rope strung through his pierced nose. Similarly, even the most powerful politicians, scholars, demigods, etc., may immediately be put into an unbearable situation by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead. Therefore the demigods have not come to Dvärakä to proudly display their universal political and intellectual powers but to humbly surrender at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead.

asya—of this (universe); asi—You are; hetuù—the cause; udaya—of the creation; sthiti—maintenance; saàyamänäm—and annihilation; avyakta—of the unmanifest material nature; jéva—the individual living beings; mahatäm—and of the mahat-tattva, with the manifest elements evolved from it; api—also; kälam—the controlling time factor; ähuù—You are said to be; saù ayam—this same personality; tri-ëäbhiù—appearing as a wheel with circumference divided into three parts (the year divided into four-month seasons); akhila—of everything; apacaye—in effecting the diminution; pravåttaù—engaged; kälaù—the time factor; gabhéra—imperceptible; rayaù—the movement of which; uttama-püruñaù—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tvam—You are.
You are the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe. As time, You regulate the subtle and manifest states of material nature and control every living being. As the threefold wheel of time You diminish all things by Your imperceptible actions, and thus You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The word gabhéra-rayaù, or "imperceptible speed and power," is significant. We observe that by the laws of nature all material things, including our own bodies, gradually disintegrate. Although we can perceive the long-term results of this aging process, we cannot experience the process itself. For example, no one can feel how his hair or fingernails are growing. We perceive the cumulative result of their growth, but from moment to moment we cannot experience it. Similarly, a house gradually decays until it is demolished. From moment to moment we cannot perceive exactly how this is happening, but in the course of longer intervals of time we can actually see the deterioration of the house. In other words, we can experience the results or manifestations of aging and deterioration, but as it is taking place the process itself is imperceptible. This is the wonderful potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of time.
The word tri-ëäbhiù indicates that according to astrological calculation of the sun's movements, the year can be divided into three sections: those represented by Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer; Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio; and Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.
The word uttama-püruña, or puruñottama, is explained in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.18):
yasmät kñaram atéto 'ham
akñaräd api cottamaù
ato 'smi loke vede ca
prathitaù puruñottamaù
"Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person."

tvattaù—from You; pumän—the puruña-avatära, Mahä-Viñëu; samadhigamya—obtaining; yayä—along with which (material nature); asya—of this creation; véryam—the potential seed; dhatte—He impregnates; mahäntam—the mahat-tattva, the raw amalgamation of matter; iva garbham—like an ordinary fetus; amogha-véryaù—He whose semen is never wasted; saù ayam—that same (mahat-tattva); tayä—with the material nature; anugataù—joined; ätmanaù—from itself; äëòa-koçam—the primeval egg of the universe; haimam—golden; sasarja—produced; bahiù—on its outside; ävaraëaiù—with several coverings; upetam—endowed.
My dear Lord, the original puruña-avatära, Mahä-Viñëu, acquires His creative potency from You. Thus with infallible energy He impregnates material nature, producing the mahat-tattva. Then the mahat-tattva, the amalgamated material energy, endowed with the potency of the Lord, produces from itself the primeval golden egg of the universe, which is covered by various layers of material elements.
In the previous verses the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead has been established in relation to the living entity and material nature. In this verse it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa is the source of the greatest Viñëu incarnation, Mahä-Viñëu, and that Mahä-Viñëu acquires His creative potency from Lord Kåñëa. It would therefore be foolish to surmise that Lord Kåñëa is an expansion of Viñëu. In this regard the opinion of the demigods, headed by Brahmä, can be taken as final.

O Lord, You are the supreme creator of this universe and the ultimate controller of all moving and nonmoving living entities. You are Håñékeça, the supreme controller of all sensory activity, and thus You never become contaminated or entangled in the course of Your supervision of the infinite sensory activities within the material creation. On the other hand, other living entities, even yogés and philosophers, are disturbed and frightened simply by remembering the material objects that they have supposedly renounced in their pursuit of enlightenment.
The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is within the heart of every conditioned soul and guides the living entity in the pursuit and experience of sense gratification. The disappointing results of such activities gradually convince the conditioned soul to reject material life and surrender again to the Lord within his heart. Lord Kåñëa is never affected by the futile attempts of the living entities to enjoy His illusory energy. For the Personality of Godhead there is no possibility of fear or disturbance, because nothing is ultimately separate from Him.

My Lord, You are living with sixteen thousand exquisitely beautiful, aristocratic wives. By their irresistible coy and smiling glances and by their lovely arching eyebrows, they send You messages of eager conjugal love. But they are completely unable to disturb the mind and senses of Your Lordship.
In the previous verse it was clearly stated that no material object can attract the senses of the Lord. Now in this verse it is demonstrated that the Lord has no desire to enjoy even spiritual sense gratification. Kåñëa is complete in Himself. He is the reservoir of all pleasure, and He does not lust after anything material or spiritual. The argument may by given that Kåñëa, in order to please His wife Satyabhämä, stole a pärijäta flower from heaven and thus appeared to be a henpecked husband under the control of His loving wife. But although Kåñëa is sometimes conquered by the love of His devotees, He is never influenced by the desire to enjoy like an ordinary, lusty materialistic person. The nondevotees cannot understand the overwhelming loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees. Kåñëa may be conquered by our intense love for Him, and thus pure devotees can control the Lord. For example, the elderly gopés in Våndävana would clap their hands in different rhythms to make Kåñëa dance, and in Dvärakä Satyabhämä ordered Kåñëa to bring her a flower as proof of His love for her. As stated in Çréniväsa Äcärya's song to the Six Gosvämés, gopé-bhäva-rasämåtäbdhi-laharé-kallola-magnau muhuù: the love between the Lord and His pure devotee is an ocean of spiritual bliss. But at the same time, Kåñëa remains completely self-satisfied. Kåñëa indifferently gave up the company of the incomparable young damsels of Vraja-bhümi, the gopés, and went to Mathurä at the request of His uncle, Akrüra. Thus neither the gopés of Våndävana nor the queens of Dvärakä could arouse an enjoying spirit in Kåñëa. When all is said and done, pleasure in this world means sex. But this mundane sexual attraction is simply a perverted reflection of the transcendental loving affairs between Kåñëa and His eternal associates in the spiritual world. The gopés of Våndävana are unsophisticated village girls, whereas the queens in Dvärakä are aristocratic young ladies. But both the gopés and the queens are overwhelmed with love for Kåñëa. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa displays the highest perfection of beauty, strength, wealth, fame, knowledge and renunciation and is thus completely satisfied by His own supreme position. He reciprocates spiritual loving affairs with the gopés and queens simply for their sake. Only fools think that Lord Kåñëa could be attracted by the perverted illusory pleasures to which we poor conditioned souls are so blindly attached. Therefore everyone should recognize the supreme transcendental position of the Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him. That is the clear implication of this statement by the demigods.

The nectar-bearing rivers of discussions about You, and also the holy rivers generated from the bathing of Your lotus feet, are able to destroy all contamination within the three worlds. Those who are striving for purification associate with the holy narrations of Your glories by hearing them with their ears, and they associate with the holy rivers flowing from Your lotus feet by physically bathing in them.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states, änuçravaà guror uccäraëam anuçrüyante: "One should hear about Kåñëa by hearing from the spiritual master." The bona fide spiritual master describes the pastimes, potencies and incarnations of the Personality of Godhead to his disciple. If the spiritual master is bona fide and if the disciple is sincere and obedient, then the communication between guru and disciple is just like nectar, both for the guru and the disciple. Ordinary persons cannot even imagine the special pleasure experienced by the devotees of the Lord. Such nectarean speaking and hearing destroys all contamination within the heart of a conditioned soul, the primary contamination being the desire to live without serving Kåñëa.
The other nectar described here is caraëämåta, the nectarean waters that bathe the Lord's feet. Lord Vämanadeva bathed His own lotus foot by kicking a hole in the universal covering so that the sacred Ganges water washed His toes and fell into the universe. The Yamunä River also washed Kåñëa's lotus feet when the Lord appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. Kåñëa sported daily with His boyfriends and girlfriends in the Yamunä River, and consequently that river is also caraëämåta. One should therefore try to take bath in the Ganges or Yamunä.
Every morning in ISKCON temples, the lotus feet of the Deity of Kåñëa are bathed, and the water thus sanctified is also called caraëämåta, the nectar of Kåñëa's lotus feet. Çréla Prabhupäda taught his disciples and followers to come before the Deities each morning and drink three drops of the caraëämåta from the Deities' bathing.
In all these ways one can purify his heart and relish spiritual bliss. When one is fixed on the platform of spiritual bliss, then one does not take another birth in the material world. In this verse the word çuci-ñadaù is significant: one must engage in the purified activities of Kåñëa consciousness. One must learn to serve the Lord from the bona fide spiritual master, whose instructions one should accept without speculation. Those who are attached to the phantasmagoria of this world sometimes concoct their own whimsical concepts of God. But only from the bona fide spiritual master can we get perfect and pure knowledge about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and devotional service to Him. Such knowledge may be found in all the books of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda.

I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original and greatest of all beings, Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is the author of the Vedas, and just to destroy His devotees' fear of material existence, like a bee He has collected this nectarean essence of all knowledge and self-realization. Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it.
Just as a bee extracts nectar from a flower without harming the flower, Lord Çré Kåñëa extracts the essence of all Vedic knowledge without disturbing the elaborate system of Vedic advancement. In other words, Lord Çré Kåñëa establishes Himself as the goal of Vedic knowledge without destroying preliminary, inferior processes that may be applicable to grossly materialistic men. Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé thus concludes by offering his obeisances to the spiritual master of the entire universe, Lord Çré Kåñëa.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatamm, entitled "Bhakti-yoga."

sattvam—goodness; rajaù—passion; tamaù—ignorance; iti—the modes of nature thus termed; éça—O Lord; tava—Your; ätma-bandho—O supreme friend of the soul; mäyä-mayäù—produced from Your personal energy; sthiti-laya-udaya—of maintenance, destruction and creation; hetavaù—the causes; asya—of this universe; léläù—as pastimes; dhåtäù—assumed; yat api—although; sattva-mayé—that which is in the mode of goodness; praçäntyai—for liberation; na—not; anye—the other two; nåëäm—for persons; vyasana—danger; moha—bewilderment; bhiyaù—and fear; ca—also; yäbhyäm—from which.
O my Lord, O supreme friend of the conditioned soul, although for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world You accept the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, which constitute Your illusory potency, You specifically employ the mode of goodness to liberate the conditioned souls. The other two modes simply bring them suffering, illusion and fear.
The words lélä dhåtäù indicate that the creative activities of Lord Brahmä, the destructive activities of Lord Çiva and the sustaining functions of Lord Viñëu are all pastimes of the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa. But ultimately only Lord Viñëu can award liberation from the clutches of material illusion, as indicated by the words sattva-mayé praçäntyai.
Our passionate and ignorant activities cause great suffering, illusion and fear for us and others; therefore they should be given up. One should become firmly situated in the mode of goodness and live peacefully on the spiritual platform. The essence of goodness is to renounce selfish interest in all one's activities and thus dedicate one's entire being to the Supreme Being, Lord Kåñëa, who is the source of our existence.

O Lord, because fearlessness, spiritual happiness and the kingdom of God are all achieved through the mode of pure goodness, Your devotees consider this mode, but never passion and ignorance, to be a direct manifestation of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Intelligent persons thus worship Your beloved transcendental form, composed of pure goodness, along with the spiritual forms of Your pure devotees.
Intelligent persons do not worship the demigods, who represent the modes of passion and ignorance. Lord Brahmä represents passion, Lord Çiva represents ignorance, and demigods such as Indra also represent the modes of material nature. But Lord Viñëu, or Näräyaëa, represents pure spiritual goodness, which brings one realization of the spiritual world, freedom from fear, and spiritual bliss. Such benefits can never be derived from impure, material goodness, for it is always mixed with the modes of passion and ignorance. As clearly indicated in this verse, the transcendental form of God is fully constituted of eternal spiritual goodness and thus has no tinge of the material mode of goodness, passion or ignorance.

A materialist, his intelligence perverted by the action of his deceptive senses, cannot recognize You at all, although You are always present within his own senses and heart and also among the objects of his perception. Yet even though one's understanding has been covered by Your illusory potency, if one obtains Vedic knowledge from You, the supreme spiritual master of all, he can directly understand You.

My dear Lord, the Vedic literatures alone reveal confidential knowledge of Your supreme personality, and thus even such great scholars as Lord Brahmä himself are bewildered in their attempt to understand You through empirical methods. Each philosopher understands You according to his particular speculative conclusions. I worship that Supreme Person, knowledge of whom is hidden by the bodily designations covering the conditioned soul's spiritual identity.
Even great demigods like Brahmä are bewildered in their speculative attempts to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Each philosopher is covered by a unique combination of the modes of nature and thus describes the Supreme Truth according to his own material conditioning. Therefore even strenuous empirical endeavor will never bring one to the conclusion of all knowledge. The highest knowledge is Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one can understand Him only by fully surrendering to Him and serving Him with love. This is why Märkaëòeya Åñi states here, vande mahä-puruñam: "I simply worship that Supreme Personality." Those who try to worship God but at the same time continue speculating or acting fruitively will attain only mixed and bewildering results. To be pure a devotee must give up all fruitive activity and mental speculation; in that way his loving service to the Lord will yield perfect knowledge of the Supreme. Only this perfection can satisfy the eternal soul.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Twelfth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Märkaëòeya's Prayers to Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi."

Çré Märkaëòeya said: O Lord Hari, I take shelter of the soles of Your lotus feet, which bestow fearlessness upon all who surrender to them. Even the great demigods are bewildered by Your illusory energy, which appears to them in the guise of knowledge.
Conditioned souls are attracted to material sense gratification, and thus they meticulously study the workings of nature. Although they appear to be advancing in scientific knowledge, they become increasingly entangled in their false identification with the material body and therefore increasingly merge into ignorance.

In the material world, conditioned souls strive to lord it over one another. Therefore they cannot understand the pastimes of the actual lords of the universe. Such bona fide lords have a wonderfully magnanimous mentality and thus sometimes bow down to the most qualified and saintly among their own subjects.

I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created this entire universe simply by His desire and then entered into it as the Supersoul. By making the modes of nature act, He seems to be the direct creator of this world, just as a dreamer seems to be acting within his dream. He is the owner and ultimate controller of the three modes of nature, yet He remains alone and pure, without any equal. He is the supreme spiritual master of all, the original personal form of the Absolute Truth.
The Supreme Lord releases His material potencies, and by their interaction creation takes place. The Lord remains aloof, as the supreme transcendental entity. Still, because the entire creation unfolds according to His design and will, His controlling hand is perceived within all things. People thus imagine that God is the direct builder of this world, although He remains aloof, creating through the manipulation of His multifarious potencies.

varam—benediction; ekam—one; våëe—I request; atha api—nevertheless; pürëät—from him who is completely full; käma-abhivarñaëät—who showers down the fulfillment of desires; bhagavati—for the Supreme Personality of Godhead; acyutäm—infallible; bhaktim—devotional service; tat-pareñu—for those who are dedicated to Him; tathä—and also; tvayi—for yourself.
But I do request one benediction from you, who are full of all perfection and able to shower down the fulfillment of all desires. I ask to have unfailing devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and for His dedicated devotees, especially you.
The words tat-pareñu tathä tvayi clearly indicate that Lord Çiva is a devotee of the Supreme Lord, not the Supreme Lord Himself. Because the representative of God is offered the same protocol as God Himself, Märkaëòeya Åñi addressed Lord Çiva as "lord" in previous verses. But now it is clearly revealed that, as stated throughout Vedic literature, Lord Çiva is an eternal servant of God and not God Himself.
Desire manifests itself within the mind and heart according to the subtle laws governing consciousness. Pure desire to engage in the loving service of the Lord brings one to the most exalted platform of consciousness, and such a perfect understanding of life is available only by the special mercy of the Lord's devotees.
