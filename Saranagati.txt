translation by Daśaratha-suta dāsa
Dedicated to His Divine Grace
A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swami Prabhupāda
who fulfilled the predictions of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura
by making Krishna Consciousness available
to the entire world
Part 1 Introductory Song
(1)
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu jīve doyā kori’
swa-pārṣada swīya dhāma saha avatari’
1) Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Prabhu descended from the eternal spiritual world along with His personal associates and divine abode, incarnating in this temporary material world out of compassion for the fallen souls.
(2)
atyanta durlabha prema koribāre dāna
śikhāya śaraṇāgati bhakatera prāna
2) In order to freely distribute the gift of ecstatic love of God, which is very difficult to obtain, He taught the path of śaraṇāgati, devotional surrender to the Supreme Lord. This śaraṇāgati is the very life of the true devotees.
(3-4)
dainya, ātma-nivedana, goptṛtve varaṇa
‘avaśya rakṣībe kṛṣṇa’—viśvāsa, pālana
bhaki-anukūla-mātra kāryera svīkara
bhakti-pratikūla-bhāva varjanāṅgikāra
3–4) The six ways of surrender through śaraṇāgati are (1) dainya—humility, (2) ātma-nivedana—dedication of the self, (3) goptṛtve varaṇa—acceptance of the Lord as one’s only maintainer, (4) the consciousness of `avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa’—`Kṛṣṇa will surely protect me’—which is viśvāsa (faith) in Kṛṣṇa’s pālana (protection), (5) bhaki-anukūla-mātra kāryera svīkara—execution of only those acts favorable to pure devotion, and (6) bhakti-pratikūla-bhāva varjanāṅgikāra—renunciation of conduct adverse to pure devotion.
(5)
ṣaḍ-aṅga śaraṇāgati hoibe jāhāra
tāhāra prārthanā śune śrī-nanda-kumāra
5) Śrī Nanda-Kumāra, the youthful son of Nanda Mahārāja, hears the prayers of anyone who takes refuge in Him by this six-fold practice of surrender.
(6)
rūpa-sanātana-pade dante tṛṇa kori’
bhakativinoda poḍe duhuṅ pada dhori’
6) Bhaktivinoda prostrates himself at the feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana Goswāmī, places a straw between his teeth, and clasps their lotus feet with his hands.
(7)
kāṅdiyā kāṅdiyā bole āmi to’ adhama
śikhāye śaraṇāgati koro he uttama
7) Weeping and weeping, he tells them, “I am certainly the lowest of men! Oh please make me the worthiest by teaching me the ways of śaraṇāgati!”
Part 2 First Principle of Surrender: Dainya
Humility
- Seven Songs -
Song 1
(1)
bhuliyā tomāre, saṁsāre āsiyā,
peye nānā-vidha byathā
tomāra caraṇe,  āsiyāchi āmi,
bolibo duḥkhera kathā
1) O Lord, I forgot You and came to this material world, where I have experienced a host of pains and sorrows. Now I approach Your lotus feet and submit my tale of woe.
(2)
jananī-jaṭhare,  chilāma jakhona,
biṣama bandhana-pāśe
eka-bāra prabhu!  dekhā diyā more,
vañcile e dīna dāse
2) While still bound up tightly in the unbearable confines of my mother’s womb, O Lord, You once revealed Yourself before me. Appearing only briefly, You then abandoned this poor servant of Yours.
(3)
takhona bhāvinu,  janama pāiyā,
koribo bhajana tava
janama hoilo,  poḍi’ māyā-jāle,
nā hoilo jñāna-lava
3) At that moment I thought, “After my birth, I will worship You.” But alas, after taking birth I fell into the entangling network of worldly illusions; thus I possessed not even a drop of true knowledge.
(4)
ādarera chele,  swa-janera kole,
hāsiyā kāṭānu kāla
janaka-jananī-  snehete bhuliyā,
saṁsāra lāgilo bhālo
4) As a dear son fondled in the laps of relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. The affection of my father and mother helped me to forget You still more, and I began to think that the material world was a very nice place.
(5)
krame dina dina,  bālaka hoiyā,
khelinu bālaka-saha
āra kichu dine,  jñāna upajilo,
pāṭha poḍi ahar-ahaḥ
5) Day by day I gradually grew into a young boy and began playing with other boys. Soon my powers of understanding emerged, so I diligently read and studied my school lessons every day.
(6)
vidyāra gaurave,  bhrami’ deśe deśe,
dhana uparjana kori
swa-jana pālana,  kori eka-mane,
bhulinu tomāre, hari!
6) Proud of my accomplished education, later I traveled from place to place and earned much wealth. Thereby maintaining my family with undivided attention, I forgot You, O Lord Hari!
(7)
bārdhakye ekhona,  bhakativinoda,
kāṅdiyā kātara ati
nā bhajiyā tore,  dina bṛthā gelo,
ekhona ki habe gati?
7) Now in old age, this Bhaktivinoda very sadly weeps. I failed to worship You, O Lord, and instead passed my days in vain. What will be my fate now?
Song 2
(1)
vidyāra vilāse,  kāṭāinu kāla,
parama sāhase āmi
tomāra caraṇa,  nā bhajinu kabhu,
ekhona śaraṇa tumi
1) With great enthusiasm I spent my time in the pleasures of mundane learning, and never worshiped Your lotus feet, O Lord. Now You are my only shelter.
(2)
poḍite poḍite,  bharasā bārilo,
jñāne gati habe māni’
se āśā biphala,  se jñāna durbala,
se jñāna ajñāna jāni
2) Reading on and on, my hopes grew and grew, for I considered the aquisition of material knowledge to be life’s true goal. How fruitless those hopes turned out to be, for all my knowledge proved feeble. Now I know that all such erudition is actually pure ignorance.
(3)
jaḍa-vidyā jata,  māyāra vaibhava,
tomāra bhajane bādhā
moha janamiyā,  anitya saṁsāre,
jīvake koraye gādhā
3) All the so-called knowledge of this world is born of the flickering potency of Your illusory energy (māyā). It is an impediment to the execution of devotional service to You. Indulgence in mundane knowledge verily makes an ass of the eternal soul by encouraging his infatuation with this temporary world. i*
(4)
sei gādhā ho’ye,  saṁsārera bojhā,
bahinu aneka kāla
bārdhakye ekhona,  śaktira abhāve,
kichu nāhi lāge bhālo
4) Here is one person who has been turned into such an ass, who for so long has carried on his back the useless burden of material existence. Now in my old age, for want of the power to enjoy, I find that nothing at all pleases me.
(5)
jīvana jātanā,  hoilo ekhona,
se vidyā avidyā bhelo
avidyāra jwālā,  ghaṭilo biṣama,
se vidyā hoilo śelo
5) Life has now become agony, for my so-called erudite knowledge has proven itself to be worthless ignorance. Material knowledge has now become a pointed shaft and has pierced my heart with the intolerable, burning pain of ignorance.
(6)
tomāra caraṇa,  binā kichu dhana,
saṁsāre nā āche āra
bhakativinoda,  jaḍa-vidyā chāḍi,’
tuwā pada kore sāra
6) O Lord, there is no treasure worth seeking in this world other than Your lotus feet. Bhaktivinoda abandons all his mundane knowledge and makes Your lotus feet the sum and substance of his life.
Song 3
(1)
jauvane jakhona,  dhana-upārjane,
hoinu vipula kāmī
dharama smariyā,  gṛhinīra kara,
dhorinu takhona āmi
1) When I was young, I felt a boundless ambition for earning money. At that time, bearing in mind the codes of religion, I accepted the hand of a wife. ii*
(2)
saṁsāra pātā’ye,  tāhāra sahita,
kāla-khoy koinu koto
bahu suta-sutā,  janama lobhilo,
marame hoinu hato
2) Along with her I set up a household and therein wasted so much of my time. Many sons and daughters were born, and my spirit was totally crushed.
(3)
saṁsārera bhāra,  bāḍe dine dine,
acala hoilo gati
bārdhakya āsiyā,  gherilo āmāre,
asthira hoilo mati
3) The burden of family life increased day by day, and under its weight I felt my personal progress in life forcibly come to a halt. Old age came and beleaguered me on all sides, making my mind incessantly disturbed.
(4)
pīḍāya asthira,  cintāya jwarita,
abhāve jwalita cita
upāya nā dekhi,  andhakāra-moya,
ekhona ho’yechi bhīta
4) Diseases trouble me, constant anxiety has made me feverish, and my heart burns with every want. I see no way out of this predicament, for all is darkness. Now I am very much afraid.
(5)
saṁsāra-taṭanī-  srota nahe śeṣa,
maraṇa nikaṭe ghora
saba samāpiyā,  bhojibo tomāya,
e āśā biphala mora
5) The current of this worldly river is strong and relentless; a frightening, gloomy death approaches. `Finishing my worldly duties, I will worship You, O Lord’—that hope is now fruitless as well.
(6)
ebe śuno prabhu!  āmi gati-hīna,
bhakativinoda koya
tava kṛpā binā,  sakali nirāśā,
deho’ more padāśroya
6) Now please hear me, O Lord! I am utterly helpless. Bhaktivinoda says, “Without Your mercy, everything is lost. Please give me the shelter of Your lotus feet.”
Song 4
(1)
āmāra jīvana,  sadā pāpe rata,
nāhiko punyera leṣa
parere udvega,  diyāchi je koto,
diyāchi jīvere kleśa
1) My life is ever given to sin; in it there is not a particle of good. I have caused others great anxiety, and have troubled all souls. iii*
(2)
nija sukha lāgi’,  pāpe nāhi ḍori,
doyā-hīna swārtha-paro
para-sukhe duḥkhī,  sadā mithya-bhāṣī,
para-duḥkha sukha-karo
2) For the sake of my own enjoyment I have never hesitated to perform sinful acts. Devoid of all compassion, I am concerned only with my selfish interests. Perpetually speaking lies, I become dejected upon seeing others happy, whereas the misery of others is a source of great delight for me.
(3)
aśeṣa kāmanā,  hṛdi mājhe mora,
krodhī, dambha-parāyana
mada-matta sadā,  viṣaye mohita,
hiṁsā-garva vibhūṣana
3) There are limitless material desires within the core of my heart. I am wrathful, fond of exhibiting arrogance, intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by worldly affairs. I wear the cherished ornaments of envy and egotism.
(4)
nidrālasya hata,  sukārye virata,
akārye udyogī āmi
pratiṣṭha lāgiyā,  śāṭhya-ācaraṇa,
lobha-hata sadā kāmī
4) Ruined by laziness and sleep, I resist all pious deeds, yet am very enthusiastic to perform wicked acts. For the sake of worldly fame and reputation I engage in the practice of deceitfulness. I am victimized by my own greed, being always lustful.
(5)
e heno durjana,  saj-jana-varjita,
aparādhi nirantara
śubha-kārya-śūnya,  sadānartha-manāḥ,
nānā duḥkhe jara jara
5) A vile, wicked man such as this, rejected by godly people, is a constant offender. Devoid of all good works, forever inclined toward evil, he is worn out and wasted by various miseries.
(6)
bārdhakye ekhona,  upāya-vihīna,
tā’te dīna akiñcana
bhakativinoda,  prabhura caraṇe,
kore duḥkha nivedana
6) Now in old age, deprived of all means of relief, thus humbled and poor, Bhaktivinoda submits his tale of grief at the feet of the Supreme Lord.
Song 5
(1)
(prabhu he!) śuno mor duḥkher kāhinī
viṣaya-halāhala,  sudhā-bhāne piyaluṅ,
āb avasāna dinamaṇi
1) O Lord! Please hear the story of my sadness. I drank the deadly poison of worldliness, pretending it was nectar, and now the sun is setting on the horizon of my life.
(2)
khelā-rase śaiśava,  poḍhaite kaiśora,
gowāoluṅ, nā bhelo vivek
bhoga-baśe yauvane,  ghara pāti’ bosiluṅ,
suta-mita bāḍhalo anek
2) I spent my childhood in play, my youth in academic pursuit, and in me there arose no sense of discrimination. In young manhood I set up a household and settled down to the spell of material enjoyment while my children and friends quickly multiplied.
(3)
vṛddha-kāla āolo,  saba sukha bhāgalo,
pīḍā-baśe hoinu kātar
sarvendriya durbala,  kṣīna kalevara,
bhogābhāve duḥkhita antar
3) Old age soon arrived, and all joys consequently departed. Subjected to the torments of disease, I am troubled and weak. All my senses are feeble now, my body is racked and exhausted, and my spirits are downcast in the absence of former sense pleasures.
(4)
jñāna-lava-hīna,  bhakti-rase vañchita,
āra mora ki habe upāy
patita-bandhu, tuhuṅ,  patitādhama hāma,
kṛpāya uṭhāo tava pāy
4) Devoid of even a particle of enlightenment, cheated of the mellows of devotion—what help is there for me now? O Lord, You are the friend of the fallen. I am certainly fallen, the lowest of men. Please, therefore, in mercy lift me to Your lotus feet.
(5)
vicārite ābahi,  guna nāhi pāobi,
kṛpā koro, choḍato vicār
tava pada-paṅkaja-  sīdhu pibāoto,
bhakativinoda karo pār
5) Were You to judge me now, You would find no good qualities. Have mercy and judge me not. Cause me to drink the honey of Your lotus feet and thereby deliver this Bhaktivinoda.
Song 6
(1)
(prabhu he!) tuwā pade e minati mor
tuwā pada-pallava,  tyajato maru-mana,
viṣama viṣaye bhelo bhor
1) O Lord! I offer this humble prayer at Your feet. I gave up the shelter of Your feet, which are soft as newly-grown leaves, and now my mind has become dried up like a desert, being scorched by the fire of absorption in horrible worldliness.
(2)
uṭhayite tākata,  puna nāhi milo-i,
anudina korohuṅ hutāś
dīna-jana-nātha,  tuhuṅ kahāyasi,
tumāri caraṇa mama āś
2) I find no strength to rise again, and thus I spend my days bitterly lamenting. O Lord who is called the master of the meek and humble! Your lotus feet are my only hope.
(3)
aichana dīna-jana,  kohi nāhi milo-i,
tuhuṅ more koro parasād
tuwā jana-saṅge,  tuwā kathā-raṅge,
chāḍahuṅ sakala paramād
3) There has never been a soul as forlorn as me. Please be merciful and award me the association of Your devotees, for by tasting the pleasure of hearing discussions of Your pastimes I shall give up all evils.
(4)
tuwā dhāma-māhe,  tuwā nāma gāoto,
gowāyabuṅ divā-niśi āś
tuwā pada-chāyā,  parama suśītala,
māge bhakativinoda dās
4) One hope animates my soul: To spend day and night singing Your holy name while living in Your divine abode. Your servant Bhaktivinoda begs a place in the supremely cooling shade of Your lotus feet.
Song 7
(1)
(prabhu he!)
emona durmati,  saṁsāra bhitore,
poḍiyā āchinu āmi
tava nija-jana,  kono mahājane,
pāṭhāiyā dile tumi
1) O Lord! With such a wicked mind as this I have fallen into the material world, but You have sent one of Your pure and elevated devotees to rescue me.
(2)
doyā kori’ more,  patita dekhiyā,
kohilo āmāre giyā
ohe dīna-jana,  śuno bhālo kathā,
ullasita ha’be hiyā
2) He saw me so fallen and wretched, took pity, and came to me saying, “O humbled soul, please listen to this good tiding, for it will gladden your heart.
(3)
tomāre tārite,  śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya,
navadwīpe avatār
tomā heno koto,  dīna hīna jane,
korilena bhava-pār
3) “Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya has appeared in the land of Navadvīpa in order to deliver you. He has safely conducted many miserable souls such as you across the sea of worldly existence.
(4)
vedera pratijñā,  rākhibāra tare,
rukma-varna vipra-suta
mahāprabhu nāme,  nadīyā mātāya,
saṅge bhāi avadhūta
4) “To fulfill the promise of the Vedas, the son of a brāhmana, of golden complexion and bearing the name of Mahāprabhu, has descended along with His brother, the avadhūta. Together They have overwhelmed all of Nadīyā with divine ecstasy. iv*
(5)
nanda-suta jini,  caitanya gosāi,
nija-nāma kori’ dān
tārilo jagat,  tumi-o jāiyā,
loho nija-paritrān
5) “Śrī Caitanya Gosāi, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself, the son of Nanda, has saved the world by freely distributing the gift of His own holy name. Go to Him also and receive your deliverance.”
(6)
se kathā śuniyā,  āsiyāchi, nātha!
tomāra caraṇa-tale
bhakativinoda,  kāṅdiyā kāṅdiyā,
āpana-kāhinī bole
6) Hearing those words, O Lord, Bhaktivinoda has come weeping and weeping to the soles of Your lotus feet and tells the story of his life.
Part 3 Second Principle of Surrender: Ātma-Nivedana
Dedication of the Self
- Eight Songs -
Song 1
(1)
nā koroluṅ karama,  geyāna nāhi bhelo,
nā sevilun caraṇa tohār
jaḍa-sukhe mātiyā,  āpanaku vañca-i,
pekhahuṅ caudiśa āndhiyār
1) I have not performed any good works. I have not amassed any transcendental knowledge. I have never worshiped Your feet. Being intoxicated by sensual pleasures, I have simply cheated myself. Now I see only darkness in all directions. v*
(2)
tuhuṅ nātha! karunā-nidān
tuwā pada-paṅkaje,  ātma samarpiluṅ,
more kṛpā korobi vidhān
2) You, O Lord, are the fountainhead of all mercy. I surrender myself at Your lotus feet; kindly show me Your compassion.
(3)
pratijñā tohāra oi,  jo hi śaraṇāgata,
nāhi so jānabo paramād
so hāma duṣkṛti,  gati nā hera-i āna,
āb māgoṅ tuwā parasād
3) It is Your promise that one who takes refuge in You will come to no harm. For a sinner like me I see no other shelter; therefore I beg You now for Your grace.
(4)
āna mano-ratha,  niḥśeṣa choḍato,
kab hāma haubuṅ tohārā
nitya-sevya tuhuṅ,  nitya-sevaka mui,
bhakativinoda bhāva sārā
4) O when will I know freedom from incessant material desires and thus become exclusively Yours? This is the sum of Bhaktivinoda’s musings—You are eternally to be served, and I am Your eternal servant.
Song 2
(1)
(prāneśwar!) kohobuṅ ki sarama ki bāt
aichana pāp nāhi,  jo hāma nā koraluṅ,
sahasra sahasra beri nāth
1) O Lord of my life! How shall I tell You of my shameful story? There is no sin which I have not committed thousands of times and more, O Lord. vi*
(2)
sohi karama-phala,  bhave moke peśa-i,
dokha deobo āb kāhi
takhonaka parinām,  kachu nā bicāraluṅ,
āb pachu taraite cāhi
2) My life in this world has only been one of affliction and torment as a result of those sins. Who is there to blame for this misery? At the time I did not consider the consequences; but now, in the aftermath, I seek to be saved.
(3)
dokha vicāra-i,  tuṅhu danḍa deobi,
hāma bhoga korabuṅ saṁsār
karato gatāgati,  bhakata-jana-saṅge,
mati rohu caraṇe tohār
3) After judging my sins, You will surely punish me befittingly, and I shall suffer the pangs of rebirth in this world. I only pray that, as I come and go through repeated births and deaths, my mind may ever dwell at Your lotus feet as I keep the company of Your devotees.
(4)
āpana caturpana,  tuwā pade soṅpaluṅ,
hṛdoya-garava dūre gelo
dīna-doyā-moya,  tuwā kṛpā niramala,
bhakativinoda āśā bhelo
4) I offer this judicious prayer at Your feet: The pride of my heart has gone far away. O You who are so kind to the meek, Your spotlessly pure mercy has become Bhaktivinoda’s only hope.

arpiluṅ tuwā pade, nanda-kiśor!

arpiluṅ tomāra pade, ohe doyā-moy!
1) All there is that may be indicated by the words aham (“I”) and mama (“mine”), I offer at Your lotus feet, O merciful Lord!

ekhona hoinu āmi kevala tomār
2) I no longer consider even myself to be “mine”, O Lord! Now I have become exclusively Yours.
(3)
`āmi’ śabde dehī jīva ahaṁtā chāḍilo
twadīyābhimāna āji hṛdoye paśilo
3) The soul inhabiting this mortal body has given up the false ego attached to the word “I”, for today the spiritual sense of being Yours has entered his heart.

bhāi, bandhu, dārā, suta, dravya, dwāra, ghar

tomāra gṛhete ebe āmi kori bās

(8)
tomāra icchāya mora icchā miśāilo
bhakativinoda āja āpane bhulilo
8) My will has become merged with Your will. From this day forward Bhaktivinoda has completely for-gotten himself.
Song 5
(1)
`āmāra’ bolite prabhu! āre kichu nāi
tumi-i āmāra mātra pitā-bandhu-bhāi
1) O Lord, nothing further remains that may be called “mine.” Father, friend, brother—You alone are all these to me.

bandhu, dārā, suta, sutā—tava dāsī dās
sei to’ sambandhe sabe āmāra prayās
2) My friends, wife, sons and daughters are now Your servants and maidservants. Whatever care I take for them is only as they are related to You.

7) I no longer do anything for my own pleasure. Bhaktivinoda says, “Your pleasure is the essence of everything.”
Song 6
(1)
bastutaḥ sakali tava, jīva keho noy
`aham’-`mama’-bhrame bhromi’ bhoge śoka-bhoy
1) In truth, all things belong to You; no jīva is ever the owner of anything. The tiny soul wanders in this world mistakenly thinking in terms of aham (“I am this material body and mind”), and mama (“everything related to this body is mine”). Thus he suffers the consequences of both sorrow and fear.
(2)
ahaṁ-mama-abhimāna ei-mātro dhan
baddha-jīva nija boli’ jāne mane man
2) The conditioned soul thinks that all the things related to the false conceptions of “I” and “mine” are his exclusive treasures. Calling them his own, his mind is firmly convinced of this gross delusion.
(3)

pekhaluṅ raṅga bahu citra
1) O Keśava! This material creation of Yours is most strange. I have roamed throughout the forest of this universe in consequence of my selfish acts, and I have beheld many curious sights.
(2)

kleśa-dahane dohi’ jāi
kapila, patañjali,  gautama, kanabhojī,
jaimini, bauddha āowe dhāi’
2) Forgetfulness of Your lotus feet, which is bitter suffering unto death, burns me with its scorching pain. In this helpless condition my would-be saviors—the sage-philosophers Kapila, Gautama, Kanāda, Jaiminī, and Buddha—have come running to my aid. ix*
(3)
tab koi nija-mate,  bhukti, mukti yācato,
pāta-i nānā-vidha phāṅd
so-sabu—vañcaka,  tuwā bhakti bahir-mukha,
ghaṭāowe viṣama paramād
3) Each expounds his particular view, dangling various pleasures and liberation as bait in their philosophical traps. But all of them are just bogus cheaters, being averse to Your devotional service, and are therefore a source of fatal danger.
(4)
vaimukha-vañcane,  bhaṭa so-sabu,
niramilo vividha pasār
danḍavat dūrato,  bhakativinoda bhelo,
bhakata-caraṇa kori’ sār
4) Every one of them are cunning experts of karma, jñāna, yoga and tāpa who provide various kinds of tempting bait for cheating the souls who are averse to You. Having paid his respects to these cheating philosophers from afar, Bhaktivinoda takes refuge at the feet of Your devotees as the essence of his life.
Song 2

gaurāṅga-varjita sthāna tīrtha nāhi māni
bhaktira bādhaka jñāna-karma tuccha jāni
5) I will never regard as sacred any place where Lord Gaurāṅga is rejected. All knowledge or action hindering pure devotional service I consider worthless.

2) I pray at Your lotus feet, O Lord, that I may be spared the company of these two kinds of people.
(3)
se duwera madhye viṣayī tabu bhālo
māyāvādī-saṅga nāhi māgi kono kālo
3) Yet of the two, the association of a worldly man is better. I never covet the company of a māyāvādī.
(4)
viṣayī-hṛdoya jabe sādhu-saṅga pāy
anāyāse labhe bhakti bhaktera kṛpāy
4) When by chance the hearts of worldly persons come into contact with Your saintly devotees, they easily attain devotion by the mercy of the devotees.

kṛṣṇa-aṅge vajra hāne tāhāra stavan

māyāvāda sama bhakti-pratikūla nāi
ataeva māyāvādī-saṅga nāhi cāi
8) There is no philosophy in the world as antagonistic to devotional service as the impersonal māyāvāda philosophy. Therefore I do not ever desire the association of the māyāvādī.

9) Bhaktivinoda drives away the philosophy of impersonalism and sits safely in the society of Vaiṣṇavas under the shelter of Your holy name.

(4)
je-je pratikūla candrāra sakhī
prāne duḥkha pāi tāhāre dekhi’
4) I feel pain in my heart whenever I happen to catch sight of Candrāvalī’s proud girlfriends, for they are all inimical to Rādhā’s camp.

nā dekhi upāya ār
agatira gati,  caraṇe śaraṇa,
tomāya korinu sār
1) O my Lord Hari! Having fallen into the illusion of this world, thus rendered helpless, I see no other means of deliverance but You. Since You are the only recourse for the helpless, I accept the shelter of Your lotus feet as most essential.

karama geyāna,  kichu nāhi mora,
sādhana bhajana nāi
tumi kṛpā-moya,  āmi to’ kāṅgāla,
ahaitukī kṛpā cāi
2) I have no background of pious activities, nor any knowledge, nor any regulated devotional practice. But You are full of compassion and kindness; therefore I, being indeed destitute, solicit Your causeless mercy.
(3)
vākya-mano-vega,  krodha-jihvā-vega,
udara-upastha-vega
miliyā e saba,  saṁsāre bhāsā’ye,
diteche paramodvega
3) The powerful urges of speech, mind, anger, tongue, belly, and genitals have banded together to cast me adrift on the sea of this material world, thus causing me grievous trouble. xiii*

āno-kathā-prajalpane
āno-adhikāra,  niyama āgrahe,
asat-saṅga-saṁghaṭane
1) O my Lord Hari! I have become absorbed in accumulating wealth and endeavoring for material possessions. I am addicted to idle conversations on topics apart from You. I mistakenly accept duties apart from my own qualifications, and am always eager to adhere to the letter of the law. This is the consequence of associating with worldly men. xv*
(2)
asthira siddhānte,  rohinu mojiyā,
hari-bhakti roilo dūre
e hṛdoye mātro,  para-hiṁsā, mada,
pratiṣṭhā, śaṭhatā sphure

āpana doṣate mari
janama biphala,  hoilo āmāra,
ekhona ki kori, hari!

tomāra pavitra nāma
se sambandha dhori’,  tomāra caraṇe,
śaraṇa loinu hāma

prema-labhe dhairya-dhana
bhakti-anukūla,  karma-pravartana,
asat-saṅga-visarjana
1) O my Lord Hari! Enthusiasm in devotional service, faith in the process of devotional service, the treasure of patience in the attainment of love of God, performing activities favorable to pure devotion, abandoning the company of worldly people...
(2)
bhakti-sadācāra,  ei chaya guna,
nāhilo āmāra nātha!
kemone bhojibo,  tomāra caraṇa,
chāḍiyā māyāra sātha
2) ...performing approved devotional practices—I have never possessed these six devotional qualities, O Lord. How, then, shall I give up my affinity for Māyā and worship Your lotus feet? xvi*

nā korinu sādhu-saṅga
lo’ye sādhu-veśa,  āne upadeśi,
e boḍo māyāra raṅga
3) Remaining absorbed in abominable activities, I never kept company with sādhus. Now I adopt the garb of a sādhu and act out the role of instructing others. This is Māyā’s big joke.

tomāra pāibo, hari!
śrī-guru-āśroye,  ḍākibo tomāya,

dāna, pratigraha,  mitho gupta-kathā,
bhakṣana, bhojana-dāna
saṅgera lakṣana,  ei chaya hoya,
ihāte bhaktira prāna
1) O my Lord Hari! Offering and receiving gifts, giving and receiving spiritual food, revealing one’s thoughts, and making confidential inquiries—these are the six characteristics of loving association, and in them is found the very life of devotion. xvii*
(2)
tattva nā bujhiye,  jñāne vā ajñāne,
asate e saba kori’
bhakti hārāinu,  saṁsārī hoinu,
sudūre rohile hari
2) I have failed to understand the truth, and by practicing these six activities with non-devotees, either knowingly or unknowingly, I lost all devotional inclination and have become a materialist. Consequently You, O Lord, still remain far away.
(3)
kṛṣṇa-bhakta-jane,  ei saṅga-lakṣane,
ādara koribo jabe
bhakti-mahā-devī,  āmāra hṛdoya-
āsane bosibe tabe
3) The day I cherish these activities of intimate association with the devotees of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, that very day the high goddess of devotion will take her seat upon the throne of my heart.

tava bhakta-jana-  saṅga anukṣana,

tāhāre pranati kori
ananya-bhajane,  vijña yei jana,
tāhāre sevibo, hari!
2) I offer obeisances to that devotee who is initiated and worships Your lotus feet, and I will faithfully serve, O Hari, a devotee who is fixed in unalloyed devotion to You.

sarva-bhūte sama,  ye bhaktera mati,
tāhāra darśane māni
āpanāke dhanya,  se saṅga pāiyā,
caritārtha hoiluṅ jāni
3) I consider myself greatly fortunate to even see that devotee who regards all living beings equally. Obtaining his association I consider myself fortunate, for I know that I have become successful in life.

niṣkapaṭa-mati,  vaiṣṇavera prati,
ei dharma kabe pā’bo
kabe saṁsāra-  sindhu-pāra ho’ye,
tava braja-pure jā’bo

tathāpi kakhona,  brahma-drava-dharma,
se salila nā chāḍoya
1) O my Lord Hari! Mud and foam are seen in the waters of the Gaṅgā, for that is the inherent nature of river water. Yet the water of the sacred Gaṅgā never loses its purely spiritual nature. xix*

vaiṣnava-śarīra,  aprākṛta sadā,
swabhāva-vapura dharme
kabhu nāhe jaḍa,  tathāpi ye ninde,
poḍe se viṣamādharme
2) One may likewise find natural defects in the body of a Vaiṣnava, yet his body is always spiritual. It is never to be considered material. That person who criticizes the body of a Vaiṣṇava falls into deadly irreligion.
(3)
sei aparādhe,  yamera jātanā,
pāya jīva avirata
he nanda-nandana!  sei aparādhe,
yeno nāhi hoi hata
3) For such an offense, the fallen soul ceaselessly suffers the tortures of Yamarāja, lord of death. O youthful son of Nanda! I pray that I will not be destroyed by committing such an offense.

tomāra vaiṣṇava,  vaibhava tomāra,
āmāre korunā doyā
tabe mora gati,  ha’be tava prati,
pā’bo tava pada-chāyā

diyā pada-chāyā,  śodho he āmāya,

chaya guna deho’ dāse
chaya sat-saṅga,  deho’ he āmāre,
bosechi saṅgera āśe

āmi to’ kāṅgāla,  `kṛṣṇa’ `kṛṣṇa’ boli’,
dhāi tava pāche pāche
4) Kṛṣṇa is yours, therefore you are able to give Him to others. This is certainly within your power. I am indeed wretched and fallen, simply running after you crying “Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!”

se nāma kīrtana kori
sitapala jeno,  nāśi’ roga-mūla,
krame swādu hoya, hari!
2) If I sing that holy name of Yours aloud every day with warm affection, then as sugar candy taken medicinally destroys the very disease which makes it taste bitter (jaundice), so Your holy name, O Lord Hari, will cure my spiritual disease and allow me to gradually taste Your sweetness.

nā hoilo, doyāmoya!
daśa aparādha,  āmāra durdaiva,

aparādha jā’be,  nāme ruci ha’be,
āswādibo nāmāsava

This should be done according to the recommended order of ascending progression. xxii*

dibe dine braja-bāsa
rāgātmika tumi,  tava padānuga,
hoite dāsera āśā
4) O Rūpa Goswāmī! When will you, out of your causeless mercy, enable this poor wretched soul to reside in Vraja? You are a rāgātmika devotee—an eternally liberated, intimate associate of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. This humble servant of yours desires to become a loyal follower of your lotus feet.
Song 10
(1)
gurudev!
boḍo kṛpā kori’,  gauḍa-vana mājhe,
godrume diyācho sthāna
ājñā dila more,  ei braje bosi’,
hari-nāma koro gāna
1) O Gurudeva! Because you are so merciful, you gave me a place to live in Godruma amid the woodlands of Gauḍa-deśa, with this order to fulfill: “Dwell here in this sacred place of Vraja and sing the holy name of Hari.”
(2)
kintu kabe prabhu,  yogyatā arpibe,\
e dāsere doyā kori’
citta sthira habe,  sakala sohibo,
ekānte bhajibo hari
2) But when, O master, out of your great mercy, will you bestow upon this servant the spiritual qualification to fulfill that order? My mind will then become tranquil, I will endure all hardships, and I will serve Lord Hari with undivided attention.
(3)
śaiśava-yauvane,  jaḍa-sukha-saṅge,
abhyāsa hoilo manda
nija-karma-doṣe,  e deho hoilo,
bhajanera pratibandha
3) Due to attachment to worldly pleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed many bad habits. Due to the reaction of these sinful acts my body itself has become an impediment to the service of the Supreme Lord.
(4)
vārdhakye ekhona,  pañca-roge hata,
kemone bhojibo bolo’
kāṅdiyā kāṅdiyā,  tomāra caraṇe,
poḍiyāchi suvihvala
4) Now, in old age, afflicted by the five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the Lord? O master, please tell me! Weeping and weeping, I have fallen at your feet, overwhelmed with anxiety. xxiii*
Song 11
(1)
gurudev!
kṛpā-bindu diyā,  koro’ ei dāse,
tṛṇāpekṣā ati hīna
sakala sahane,  bala diyā koro’,
nija-māne spṛhā-hīna
1) O Gurudeva! By administering a drop of your mercy make this servant of yours infinitely more humble than a blade of grass. Giving me the strength to bear all trials and troubles, free me from desires for personal honor. xxiv*
(2)
sakale sammāna,  korite śakati,
deho’ nātha! jathājatha
tabe to’ gāibo,  hari-nāma-sukhe,
aparādha ha’be hata
2) O lord and master! Inspire me with the power to befittingly honor all living beings. Only then will I sing the holy name of the Lord in great ecstasy, and my offensive activities will cease.
(3)
kabe heno kṛpā,  labhiyā e jana,
kṛtārtha hoibe, nātha!
śakti-buddhi-hīna,  āmi ati dīna,
koro’ more ātma-sātha
3) When will this person be indeed blessed by receiving your mercy, O lord and master? Devoid of all strength and intelligence, I am very low and fallen. Please make me your own.
(4)
yogyatā-vicāre,  kichu nāhi pāi,
tomāra karuṇā—sāra
karuṇā nā hoile,  kāṅdiyā kāṅdiyā,
prāṇa nā rākhibo āra
4) When I examine myself for worthiness, I find nothing of value. Therefore Your mercy is the essence of life. If you are not merciful to me, then I will constantly weep and weep, no longer being able to maintain my life.
Song 12
(1)
gurudev!
kabe mora sei din ha’be
mana sthira kori’,  nirjane bosiyā,
kṛṣṇa-nāma gā’bo jabe
saṁsāra-phukāra,  kāne nā poṣibe,
deho-roga dūre ro’be
1) O Gurudeva! When will that day be mine? With a steady mind, sitting in a secluded place, I will sing the name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The tumultuous pandemonium of worldly existence will no longer echo in my ears, and the diseases of the body will remain far away.
(2)
`hare kṛṣṇa’ boli’,  gāhite gāhite,
nayane bohibe lora
dehete pulaka,  udita hoibe,
premete koribe bhora
2) When I chant “Hare Kṛṣṇa” tears of love will flow and flow from my eyes. Ecstatic rapture will arise within my body, causing my hair to stand on end and my entire being to become overwhelmed with divine love.
(3)
gada-gada vānī,  mukhe bāhiribe,
kāṅpibe śarīra mama
gharma muhur muhuḥ,  virvarna hoibe,
stambhita pralaya sama
3) Faltering words choked with emotion will issue from my mouth. My body will tremble, constantly perspire, turn pale and discolored, and become stunned. All of this will be like a devastation of ecstatic love and cause me to fall unconscious. xxv*
(4)
niṣkapaṭe heno,  daśā kabe ha’be,
nirantara nāma gā’bo
āveśe rohiyā,  deha-yātrā kori’,
tomāra karunā pā’bo
4) When will such a genuine ecstatic condition be mine? I will constantly sing the holy name and remain absorbed in profound devotion while traveling in the material body. In this way I will receive your mercy.
Song 13
(1)
gurudev!
kabe tava karunā-prakāśe
śrī-gaurāṅga-līlā,  hoya nitya-tattwa,
ei dṛḍha viśvāse
`hari hari’ boli’,  godruma-kānane,
bhromibo darśana-āśe
1) O Gurudeva! When will it be, as a manifestation of your mercy? I will become fixed in the firm faith that Lord Gaurāṅga’s pastimes are eternal realities. Chanting “Hari! Hari!” I will wander throughout the groves of Godruma, hoping to catch a glimpse of those pastimes.
(2)
nitāi, gaurāṅga,  adwaita, śrīvāsa,
gadādhara,—pañca-jana
kṛṣṇa-nāma-rase,  bhāsā’be jagat,
kori’ mahā-saṅkīrtana
2) The five personalities—Nitāi, Gaurāṅga, Advaita, Śrīvāsa, and Gadādhara—will flood the entire universe with the intoxicating nectar of the holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa by performing a mahā-saṅkīrtan.
(3)
nartana-vilāsa,  mṛdaṅga-vādana,
śunibo āpana-kāne
dekhiyā dekhiyā,  se līlā-mādhurī,
bhāsibo premera bāne
3) With my own ears I will hear the sounds of playful dancing and the rhythmic pulsations of the mṛdaṅga drums. By constantly looking and looking upon the sweetness and beauty of that pastime, I will float in the floodtide of divine love.
(4)
nā dekhi’ ābāra,  se līlā-ratana,
kāṅdi hā gaurāṅga! boli’
āmāre viṣayī,  pāgala boliyā,
aṅgete dibeka dhūli
4) The next moment losing sight of the jewel of that pastime, I shall weep and cry out, “O my Lord Gaurāṅga!” Materialists will then proclaim me thoroughly mad and will throw dust upon my body.
Thus ends the section on Bhajana-Lālasā.

Song 1
(1)
kabe gaura-vane,  suradhunī-taṭe,
`hā rādhe hā kṛṣṇa’ bole’
kāṅdiyā beḍā’bo,  deho-sukha chāḍi’,
nānā latā-taru-tale
1) When will I wander weeping under the shade of various trees and creepers on the banks of the celestial Gaṅgā river in the land of Navadvīpa, crying, “O Rādhe! O Kṛṣṇa!” and forgetting all physical comforts?
(2)
śwa-paca-gṛhete,  māgiyā khāibo,
pibo saraswatī-jala
puline puline,  gaḍā-gaḍi dibo,
kori’ kṛṣṇa-kolāhala
2) I will take my meals by begging at the homes of dog-eaters, and will drink the water of the Sarasvatī river. In ecstasy I will roll on the ground from bank to bank of the river, raising an uproar of “Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!”
(3)
dhāma-bāsī jane,  pranati koriyā,
māgibo kṛpāra leśa
vaiṣṇava-caraṇa-  reṇu gāya mākhi’,
dhori’ avadhūta-veśa
3) Bowing down to the inhabitants of the holy land, I will beg a particle of their mercy. I will smear the dust of the Vaiṣṇavas’ feet all over my body and wear the dress of a mendicant.
(4)
gauḍa-braja-jane,  bheda nā dekhibo,
hoibo baraja-bāsī
dhāmera swarūpa,  sphuribe nayane,
hoibo rādhāra dāsī
4) I will see no difference between the inhabitants of Vraja Bhūmi and those of Navadvīpa, and I will be transformed into a resident of Vraja. The true nature of the Lord’s abode will manifest itself to my eyes, and I will become a maidservant of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. xxvi*
Song 2
(1)
dekhite dekhite,  bhulibo vā kabe,
nija-sthūla-paricoya
nayane heribo,  braja-pura-śobhā,
nitya cid-ānanda-moya
1) When, in a flash, will I forget my gross bodily indentity? I will behold the exquisite beauty of the realm of Vraja, full of eternal spiritual bliss.
(2)
bṛṣabhānu-pure,  janama loibo,
yāvaṭe vivāha ha’be
braja-gopī-bhāva,  hoibe swabhāva,
āno-bhāva nā rohibe
2) I shall have my birth in the town of King Vṛṣabhānu, and eventually be married nearby in Yāvaṭ-grām. My sole disposition and character shall be that of a cowherd girl, and I shall know no other mood. xxvii*
(3)
nija-siddha-deha,  nija-siddha-nāma,
nija-rūpa-swa-vasana
rādhā-kṛpā-bale,  lobhibo vā kabe,
kṛṣṇa-prema-prakaraṇa
3) When will I obtain, by the power of Rādhā’s mercy, my own eternal spiritual body, my own realized name, my own form, and my own dress? And when, by Her mercy, will I receive initiation into the techniques of expressing divine love for Kṛṣṇa? xxviii*
(4)
jamunā-salila-  āharaṇe giyā,
bujhibo yugala-rasa
prema-mugdha ho’ye,  pāgalinī-prāya,
gāibo rādhāra yaśa
4) As I go to draw water from the Yamunā, I shall cherish knowing the confidential mellows that unite the divine pair Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Being enchanted by sublime love, I will sing Śrī Rādhā’s glories just like a madwoman.
Song 3
(1)
bṛṣabhānu-sutā-  caraṇa-sevane,
hoibo ye pālya-dāsī
śrī-rādhāra sukha,  satata sādhane,
rohibo āmi prayāsī
1) For serving the lotus feet of the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, I shall become a protected maidservant of one of the gopīs in Vraja. I will always strive to bring about the pleasure of Śrī Rādhā. xxix*
(2)
śrī-rādhāra sukhe,  kṛṣṇaera ye sukha,
jānibo manete āmi
rādhā-pada chāḍi’,  śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅgame,
kabhu nā hoibo kāmī
2) Within my heart I will know that Rādhā’s pleasure is Kṛṣṇa’s only source of joy. Therefore, I will never desire to abandon Her lotus feet for enjoying His exclusive company. xxx*
(3)
sakhī-gaṇa mama,  parama-suhṛt,
yugala-premera guru
tad-anugā ho’ye,  sevibo rādhāra,
caraṇa-kalapa-taru
3) The sakhīs are my best friends and teachers concerning the love uniting Rādhā with Kṛṣṇa. By following their example, I shall serve Rādhā’s lotus feet, which are like wish-fulfilling trees.
(4)
rādhā-pakṣa chāḍi’,  ye-jana se-jana,
ye bhāve se bhāve thāke
āmi to’ rādhikā-  pakṣa-pātī sadā,
kabhu nāhi heri tā’ke
4) I myself am always partial to Rādhikā’s camp and therefore never look upon those who have abandoned Rādhā’s entourage, whoever they may be and whatever their ways. xxxi*
Part 10 Vijñapti
Spiritual Request
[rāginī—Suraṭa-Khāmbāja, Ekatālā]
(1)
kabe ha’be bolo se-dina āmār
(āmār) aparādha ghuci’,  śuddha nāme ruci,
kṛpā-bale ha’be hṛdoye sañcār
1) Please tell me, when oh when will that day be mine? My offenses will come to an end, and a taste for the pure holy name will be infused within my heart by the power of divine grace.
(2)
tṛnādhika hīna,  kabe nije māni’,
sahiṣnutā-guna hṛdoyete āni’
sakale mānada,  āpani amānī,
hoye āswādibo nāma-rasa-sār
2) Feeling myself lower than a blade of grass, welcoming the quality of forbearance into my heart, giving honor to all living beings, and being freed from false pride, when will I taste the essence of the liquid nectar of the holy name? xxxii*
(3)
dhana jana āra,  kavitā-sundarī,
bolibo nā cāhi deho-sukha-karī
janme janme dāo,  ohe gaurahari!
ahaitukī bhakti caraṇe tomār
3) Wealth, followers, beautiful women as described in worldly poetry—I do not want any such bodily pleasures. O Lord Gaurahari! Please give me unmotivated devotion to Your lotus feet birth after birth. xxxiii*
(4)
(kabe) korite śrī-kṛṣṇa-  nāma uccāraṇa,
pulakita deho gadgada vacana
vaivarnya-vepathu,  ha’be saṁghaṭana,
nirantara netre ba’be aśru-dhār
4) When, while articulating the divine name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, will my body be thrilled in ecstatic rapture, my words choking with emotion, loss of color and ecstatic trembling occuring, and streams of tears flowing constantly from my eyes?
(5)
kabe navadwīpe,  suradhunī-taṭe,
gaura-nityānanda boli’ niṣkapaṭe
nāciyā gāiyā,  beḍāibo chuṭe,
bātulera prāya chāḍiyā vicār
5) When, in the land of Navadvīpa, on the banks of the celestial Gaṅgā, will I run about innocently calling out, “O Gaura! O Nityānanda!”? Dancing and singing, I will wander about like a madman, giving up all consideration of proper social behavior.
(6)
kabe nityānanda,  more kori’ doyā,
chāḍāibe mora viṣayera māyā
diyā more nija-  caraṇera chāyā,
nāmera hāṭete dibe adhikār
6) When will Lord Nityānanda be merciful to me and release me from the illusion of worldliness? When will He give me the shade of His own lotus feet and bestow upon me the qualification necessary to enter the Marketplace of the Holy Name? xxxiv*
(7)
kinibo, luṭibo,  hari-nāma-rasa,
nāma-rase māti’ hoibo vivaśa
rasera rasika-  caraṇa paraśa,
koriyā mojibo rase anibār
7) Somehow or other I shall buy or steal the mellows of the name of Lord Hari. Becoming thoroughly intoxicated by those liquid mellows, I will be stunned. By touching the feet of those great souls who are expert in relishing those mellows, I will be constantly immersed in the sweet nectar of the holy name.
(8)
kabe jīve doya,  hoibe udoya,
nija-sukha bhuli’ sudīna-hṛdoya
bhakativinoda,  koriyā vinoya,
śrī-ājñā-ṭahala koribe pracār
8) When will there be an awakening in me of compassion for all fallen souls? Then this Bhaktivinoda will forget his own happiness, and with a meek heart he will set out to propagate by humble solicitation the sacred order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
Part 11Śrī Nāma-Māhātmya
Song
The Glories of the Holy Name
(1)
kṛṣṇa-nāma dhare koto bal
viṣaya-vāsanānale,  mora citta sadā jwale,
ravi-tapta maru-bhūmi-sam
karna-randhra-patha diyā,  hṛdi mājhe praveśiyā,
variṣoya sudhā anupam
1) What power does the name of Kṛṣṇa possess? My heart constantly burns in the fire of worldly desires, just like a desert scorched by the rays of the sun. The holy name, entering the core of my heart through the holes of my ears, showers unparalleled nectar upon my soul.
(2)
hṛdoya hoite bole,  jihvāra agrete cale,
śabda-rūpe nāce anukṣan
kanṭhe mora bhaṅge swara,  aṅga kāṅpe thara thara,
sthira hoite nā pāre caraṇ
2) The holy name speaks from within my heart, moves onto the tip of my tongue, and constantly dances on it in the form of transcendental sound. My throat becomes choked up, my body shivers again and again, and my feet cannot remain still.
(3)
cakṣe dhārā, dehe gharma,  pulakita saba carma,
vivarna hoilo kalevara
mūrchita hoilo man,  pralayera āgaman,
bhāve sarva-deha jara jara
3) Rivers of tears flow from my eyes, perspiration completely soaks my body, all my skin thrills with rapture, my hairs stand on end, and my complexion turns pale and discolored. My mind grows faint, I begin to experience devastation, and my entire body is shattered in a flood of ecstatic emotions.
(4)
kori’ eto upadrava,  citte varṣe sudhā-drava,
more ḍāre premera sāgare
kichu nā bujhite dilo,  more to’ bātula koilo,
mora citta-vitta saba hare
4) While causing such an ecstatic disturbance, the holy name showers liquid nectar on my heart and drowns me in the ocean of divine love of Godhead. He does not allow me to understand anything, for He has made me truly mad by having stolen away my mind and all my resources.
(5)
loinu āśroya jā’r,  heno vyavahāra tā’r,
varnite nā pāri e sakal
kṛṣṇa-nāma icchā-moy,  jāhe jāhe sukhī hoy,
sei mora sukhera sambal
5) Such is the behavior of Him in whom I have taken shelter. I am not capable of describing all this. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is independent and thus acts on His own sweet will. In whatever way He becomes happy, that is also my way of happiness.
(6)
premera kalikā nām,  adbhuta rasera dhām,
heno bala karaye prakāś
īṣat vikaśi’ punaḥ,  dekhāy nija-rūpa-guna,
citta hari’ loya kṛṣṇa-pāś
6) The holy name is the bud of the flower of divine love, and is the very abode of astonishing mellows. Such is the power He manifests that when His holy name starts to blossom a little further, it then reveals His own divine form and qualities. Thus my heart is abducted and taken directly to Kṛṣṇa.
(7)
pūrna vikaśita hoiyā,  braje more jāya loiyā,
dekhāy more swarūpa-vilās
more siddha-deha diyā,  kṛṣṇa-pāśe rākhe giyā,
e dehera kore sarva-nāś
7) Blossoming fully, the flower of the holy name takes me to Vraja and reveals to me His own love-dalliance. This name gives to me my own eternal spiritual body, keeps me right by Kṛṣṇa’s side, and completely destroys everything related to this mortal frame of mine.
(8)
kṛṣṇa-nāma-cintāmaṇi,  akhila rasera khani,
nitya-mukta śuddha-rasa-moy
nāmera bālāi jata,  saba lo’ye hoi hata,
tabe mora sukhera udoy
8) The name of Kṛṣṇa is a transcendental touchstone, a mine of all devotional mellows. It is eternally liberated, and the embodiment of pure rasa. When all impediments to the pure chanting of the holy name are taken away and destroyed, then my happiness will know its true awakening.
Thus ends Śaraṇāgati by Ṭhākura Bhaktivinoda.
