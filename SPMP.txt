Music & Purports
   "Songs composed by the ācāryas are not ordinary songs. When chanted by pure Vaiṣṇavas who follow the rules and regulations of Vaiṣṇava character, they are actually effective in awakening the Kṛṣṇa consciousness dormant in every living entity."
      — A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Āmāra Jīvana & Purport
(1)
āmāra jīvana, sadā pāpe rata,
nāhiko puṇyera leṣa
parere udvega, diyāchi ye koto,
diyāchi jīvere kleśa
[I am an impious sinner and have caused others great anxiety and trouble.]
(2)
nija sukha lāgi', pāpe nāhi ḍori,
dayā-hīna svārtha-paro
para-sukhe duḥkhī, sadā mithya-bhāṣī,
para-duḥkha sukha-karo
[I have never hesitated to perform sinful acts for my own enjoyment. Devoid of all compassion, concerned only with my own selfish interests, I am remorseful seeing others happy. I am a perpetual liar, and the misery of others is a source of great pleasure for me.]
(3)
āśeṣa kāmanā, hṛdi mājhe mora,
krodhī, dambha-parāyaṇa
mada-matta sadā, viṣaye mohita,
hiṁsā-garva vibhūṣaṇa
[The material desires within the core of my heart are unlimited. I am wrathful, devoted to false pride and arrogance, intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by worldly affairs. Envy and egotism are the ornaments I wear.]

akārye udyogī āmi
pratiṣṭha lāgiyā, śāṭhya-ācaraṇa,
lobha-hata sadā kāmī
[Ruined by laziness and sleep, I resist all pious deeds; yet I am very active and enthusiastic to perform wicked acts. For worldly fame and reputation I engage in the practice of deceitfulness. Thus I am destroyed by my own greed and am always lustful.]

e heno durjana, saj-jana-varjita,
aparādhi nirantara
śubha-kārya-śūnya, sadānartha-manāḥ,
nānā duḥkhe jara jara
[A vile, wicked man such as this, rejected by godly people, is a constant offender. I am such a person, devoid of all good works, forever inclined toward evil, worn out and wasted by various miseries.]
(6)
bārdhakye ekhona, upāya-vihīna,
tā'te dīna akiṣcana
bhakativinoda, prabhura caraṇe,
kore duḥkha nivedana
[Now in old age, deprived of all means of success, humbled and poor, Bhaktivinoda submits his tale of grief at the feet of the Supreme Lord.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Āmāra jīvana sadā pāpe rata nāhiko puṇyera leśa. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in Vaiṣṇava humbleness. A Vaiṣṇava is always meek and humble. So he is describing the life of the people in general, taking himself to be one of them. The people in general are like the description given here. 
He says that "My life is always engaged in sinful activities, and if you try to find out, you will not find even a trace of pious activities. Only full of sinful activities. And I am always inclined to give trouble to other living entities. That is my business. I want to see that others are suffering, and I enjoy.'' 
Nija sukha lāgi' pāpe nāhi ḍori. "For my personal sense gratification, I do not care for any sinful activities. That means I accept any kind of sinful activity if it is satisfactory to my senses.'' 
Dayā-hīna swārtha-paro. "I am not at all merciful, and only I see to my personal interest.'' 
Para-sukhe duḥkhī. "As such, when others are suffering I become very happy, and always talking lies,'' sadā mithyā-bhāṣī. "Even for ordinary things I am accustomed to speak lies.'' 
Para-duḥkha sukha-karo. "And if one is suffering, that is very pleasant to me.'' 
Aśeṣa kāmanā hṛdi mājhe mora. "I have got lots of desire within my heart, and I am always angry and falsely prestigious, always puffed up with false pride.'' 
Mada-matta sadā viṣaye mohita. "I am captivated in subject matters of sense gratification, and almost I am crazy.'' 
Hiṁsā-garva vibhūṣaṇa. "My ornaments are enviousness and false pride.'' 
Nidralāsya hata sukārje birata. "I am subdued, or I am conquered by sleep and laziness,'' sukārje birata, "and I am always averse to pious activities,'' akārje udyogī āmi, "and I am very enthusiastic to perform impious activities.'' 
Pratiṣṭha lāgiyā śāṭhya-ācaraṇa, "I always cheat others for my prestige.'' 
Lobha-hata sadā kāmī, "I am conquered by greediness and always lusty.'' 
E heno durjana saj-jana-barjita, "So I am so fallen, and I have no association of devotees.'' 
Aparadhi, "Offender,'' nirantara, "always.'' 
Śubha-kārja-śūnya, "In my life, there is not a beat of auspicious activities,'' sadānartha manāḥ, "and my mind is always attracted by something mischievous.'' 
Nānā duḥkhe jara jara. "Therefore at the fag end of my life, I am almost invalid by all such sufferings.'' 
Bārdhakye ekhona upāya-vihīna, "In my old age I have no other alternative now,'' tā 'te dīna akiṣcana, "therefore by force, I have now become very humble and meek.'' 
Bhaktivinoda prabhura caraṇe, "Thus Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is offering his statement of life's activities at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord."
Anādi Karama-phale & Purport

(1)
anādi' karama-phale, paḍi' bhavārṇara jale,
taribāre nā dekhi upāya
ei viṣaya-halāhale, divā-niśi hiyā jvale,
mana kabhu sukha nāhi pāya
[I have fallen into the ocean of material existence as a result of my selfish activities, which are without beginning, and I see no means of deliverance from this great ocean of nescience. Day and night my heart burns from the poison of these worldly activities, and on account of this my mind never finds any satisfaction or happiness.]
(2)
āśā-pāśa-śata-śata, kleśa deya avirata,
pravṛtti-ūrmira tāhe khelā
kāma-krodha-ādi chaya, bāṭapālsvḍe deya bhaya,
avasāna hoilo āsi' belā
[Hundreds and thousands of desires, like nooses around my neck, constantly give me misery and trouble. In that great ocean of nescience play the waves of materialistic tendency. In this world there are many thieves and rogues, of whom six are prominent; lust, anger, greed, illusion, and madness. They are causing me great fear, and in this way my life is coming to an end.]
(3)
jnāna-karma-ṭhaga dui, more pratārīya loi,
avaśeṣe phele sindhu-jale
e heno samaye, bandhu, tumi kṛṣṇa kṛpā-sindhu,
kṛpā kori' tolo more bale
[The two highway robbers, mental speculation and fruitive activity, have cheated me and misled me, and finally they are throwing me into the ocean of misery. At such a time as this, my dear Kṛṣṇa, You are the only friend, and You are the ocean of mercy and compassion. I have no strength to get out of this ocean of nescience, so I pray to Your lotus feet that You will be kind and by Your strength uplift me from this ocean of suffering.]
(4)
patita-kiṅkare dhari', pāda-padma-dhuli kari',
deho bhaktivinoda āśraya
āmi tava nitya-dāsa, bhuliyā māyāra pāśa,
baddha ho'ye āchi dayāmaya
[Accept this fallen servant and fix me as a particle of dust on Your lotus feet. Kindly give me shelter to this Bhaktivinoda. O most merciful Lord, actually I am Your eternal servant, but having forgotten this I have become bound up in the network of māyā.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Anādi karama-phale. Anādi karama-phale pori' bhavārṇava-jale taribāre nā dekhi upāya. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura depicting the picture of the conditioned soul. It is said here, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is speaking, taking himself as one of the ordinary human being, that due to my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen in this ocean of nescience, and I do not find any means of coming out of this great ocean. It is just like the ocean of poison, e viṣaya-halāhale, divā-niśi hiyā jvale. 
As, if anyone takes some pungent food, it burns the heart, similarly, as we are trying to be happy by sense enjoyment, actually it is just becoming the opposite, a cause of burning our heart. E viṣaya-halāhale, divā-niśi hiyā jvale, that burning sensation is going on twenty-four hours, day and night. 
Mana kabhu sukha nāhi pāya, and on account of this my mind is not at all in satisfaction. Āśā-pāśa-śata-śata kleśa dey abirata, I am always making plan, hundreds and thousands, how I shall become happy, but actually all of them giving me trouble, pains, twenty-four hours. 
Pravṛtti-ūrmira tāhe khelā, it is exactly like the waves of the ocean, always dashing one another, that is my position. Kāma-krodha-ādi caya, bāṭapāre dey bhaya, besides that, there are so many thieves and rogues. Especially they are six in number, namely lust, anger, envy, illusion, and so many ways, they are always present, and I am afraid of them. Abasāna hoilo āsi' belā, in this way, my life is becoming advanced, or I am coming to the point of end. 
Jṣāna-karma ṭhaga dui, more pratāriyā loi, although this is my position, still, two kinds of activities, namely mental speculation and fruitive activities, they are cheating me. Jṣāna-karma ṭhaga, ṭhaga means cheater. There are jṣāna-karma ṭhaga dui, more pratāriyā loi, they are misleading me, and abaśeṣe fele sindhu-jale, after misleading me, they bring me on the seashore, and pushes me down within the sea. 
E heno samaye bandhu, tumi kṛṣṇa kṛpā-sindhu, under the circumstance, my dear Kṛṣṇa, you are the only friend, tumi kṛṣṇa kṛpā-sindhu. Kṛpā kori' tolo more bale, now I lave no strength to get out of this ocean of nescience, so I request, I pray unto Your lotus feet, that by Your strength, You kindly pick me up. 
Patita-kiṅkare dhari' pāda-padma-dhūli kori', after all, I am Your eternal servant. So, somehow or other, I am fallen in this ocean, You kindly pick me up, and fix me as one of the dust of Your lotus feet. 
Deho bhaktivinoda āśraya, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura entreats, that "Kindly give me shelter on Your lotus feet.'' Āmi tava nitya-dāsa, actually I am Your eternal servant. Bhuliyā māyāra pāś, somehow or other I forgot You, and I am now fallen in the network of māyā. Baddha ho'ye āchi doyāmoy, my dear Lord, I have been entangled in this way. Kindly save me.

bhajibo boliyā ese saṁsāra-bhitare
bhuliyā rohile tumi avidyāra bhare

kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśācīra kole
[Lord Gaurāṅga is calling, "Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! You have slept so long on the lap of the witch Māyā!]
"How long you shall go on sleeping on the lap of the witches, māyā?" Bhajibo boliyā ese saṁsāra-bhitare: "In the womb of your mother you promised that this life you shall engage in the matter of developing your Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Bhuliyā rohile tumi avidyāra bhare: "But you are forgotten everything under the spell of illusory energy." 
Actually, when the child remains within the womb of his mother, packed up in airtight bag, at the age of seven months within the womb, when he develops his consciousness, he feels very uncomfortable, and the fortunate baby prays to God, "Please relieve me from this awkward position, and this life I shall fully engage myself in developing my God consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness." But as soon as the child comes out of the womb of his mother, under the spell of these three modes of material nature he forgets, and he cries, and the parents take care, and the whole thing is forgotten.
There is one instance of Parīkṣit Mahārāja. When he was in the womb of his mother, their paternal, I mean to say, enemy, Droṇa..., son of Droṇācārya, Aśvatthāmā, he released a weapon called brahmāstra. The brahmāstra could kill even within the womb. So at that time Lord Kṛṣṇa entered and saved the child. The child saw the form of Kṛṣṇa and was remembering. And when the child came out, he was trying to find out where is that form. He was searching after Kṛṣṇa. So the astrologers who were present there, they could understand that "This child is seeking something." Therefore his name was given, Parīkṣit. Parīkṣit means one who is trying to test. Parikṣa. Parikṣa means test, examination. 
So there are many examples. Of course, very rare the child remembers. Generally forgets. So Lord Caitanya is trying to wake up all children of māyā, nature's son, to wake up. The similar instruction is in the Vedic Upaniṣad: uttiṣṭhata jāgrata. The advice is that "Everyone should now wake up. They should not sleep under the spell of illusion, material nature. This human form of body must be utilized." The same thing Lord Caitanya is speaking in ordinary song, jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, gauracānda bole: "All living entities wake up. Don't miss this opportunity." Kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśācīra: "How long you shall remain asleep in this way, under the spell of māyā? This is the opportunity. Don't sleep."
Then He says, "You have forgotten. But I have brought one medicine so that..." Just like when a man remains unconscious under some intoxication or snake bite, there are some herbs. If it is put before the nostril and if the patient smells, immediately he gets consciousness. Similarly, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "I have brought also one medicine." Enechi auśādhi māyā nasibaro lagi': "This medicine can dissipate your this forgetfulness under the spell of māyā." Enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro. What is that? Hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi: "This is this chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. You please take it."
The idea is that if one simply chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, his unconscious stage, or sleeping stage under the spell of illusory māyā, will gradually vanish. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc Antya 20.12].
[Let there be all victory for the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, which can cleanse the mirror of the heart and stop the miseries of the blazing fire of material existence. That chanting is the waxing moon that spreads the white lotus of good fortune for all living entities. It is the life and soul of all education. The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa expands the blissful ocean of transcendental life. It gives a cooling effect to everyone and enables one to taste full nectar at every step.]
So this is a song composed by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. So he says that bhakativinoda prabhu-caraṇe pariyā: "Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura took the advantage of the instruction of Lord Caitanya and immediately fell down on the lotus feet of the Lord," hari-nāma mahā-mantra loilo māgiyā, "and very humbly he begged Lord Caitanya, 'Kindly give me this medicine, and I shall utilize it.' '' 
The whole instruction is that all sleeping members of the human society, they should take advantage of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and willingly they should accept. Then there will be immediate effect, and everyone will be out of the clutches of māyā, and his original consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, will be awakened, and his life will be sublime. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Bhajahū re mana, śrī-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraṇāravinda re. This is a song composed by Govinda dāsa, a great poet and Vaiṣṇava. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that if you have your mind controlled, then your mind is the best friend. But if your mind is uncontrolled, then he is your greatest enemy. So we are seeking after friend or enemy. So both of them are sitting with me. If we can utilize the friendship of the mind, then we are elevated to the highest perfectional stage. But if we create mind as my enemy, then my path to hell is clear. 
Therefore Govinda dāsa Ṭhākura, he is addressing his mind. The yogis try to control the mind by different gymnastic process. That is also approved. But it takes a long time, and sometimes there are failures. In most cases they are failures. Even a big yogi like Viśvāmitra, he also failed, what to speak of these teeny and nonsensical yogis.
So Govinda dāsa advises that "You just engage your mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then mind becomes automatically controlled.'' If the mind has no chance of being engaged in any other business except Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he cannot become my enemy. It is automatically my friend. That is the instruction in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ [SB 9.4.18]. 
[Mahārāja Ambarīṣa always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kṛṣṇa or about Kṛṣṇa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's temples and Kṛṣṇa's places like Mathurā and Vṛndāvana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasī offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasāda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.]
Lord, King Ambarīṣa, he first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So similarly, here also, Govinda dāsa Ṭhākura, he is asking his mind: "My dear mind, you just engage yourself to the lotus feet of abhaya-caraṇāravinda.'' That is the name of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Abhaya means fearless. 
If you take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa then you immediately become fearless. So he advises "My dear mind, you just engage yourself on the service of the lotus feet of Govinda.'' Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana. He does not say "Govinda.'' He addresses Kṛṣṇa as "the son of Nanda Mahārāja.'' "Because that lotus feet is fearless, you will have no more any fear from the attack of māyā."
"Oh, I have got to enjoy so many things. How can I fix up my mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa?'' Then Govinda dāsa advises, "No, no.'' Durlabha mānava-janma. "You don't waste your life in that way. This human form of life is very rare. Out of many, many thousands and millions of births, you have got this opportunity.'' Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge. "Therefore don't go anywhere. You just associate with pure devotees.'' Taraha ei bhava-sindhu re. "Then you shall be able to cross of the ocean of nescience.'' "Oh, if I engage my mind always in Kṛṣṇa, then how I shall enjoy my family, my other paraphernalia?'' 
So Govinda dāsa says, ei dhana yauvana. "You want to enjoy your wealth and your youthful ages,'' ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, "and you want to enjoy the society of friendship, love and family, but I say,'' ithe ki āche paratīti re, "do you think that there is transcendental pleasure in this nonsense thing? No, there is none. It is simply illusion.'' Ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, ithe ki āche paratīti re. Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge, taraha ei bhava sindhu re, śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa ei dina jāminī jāgi 're, viphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana capala sukha-laba lāgi' re. 
Govinda dāsa is reminding his mind: "You have experience of your material happiness. So material happiness means, the ultimate goal of material happiness is sex life. But don't you remember how long you can enjoy this sex life?" Capala. "Flickering. Say, for a few  Minutes or moment. That's all. But for that purpose you are working so hard?" Śīta ātapa. "Don't care for snowfall. Don't care for scorching heat. Don't care for torrents of rain. Don't care for keeping night duty. Whole day and night you are working. 
And what is the result? Simply for that flickering momentous enjoyment. Are you not ashamed of this?" So śīta ātapa, bāta bariṣaṇa, ei dina jāminī jāgi re. Dina means day, and jāminī means night. "Day and night, you are working so hard. Why?" Capala sukha-laba lāgi' re. "Simply for that flickering happiness." Then he says, ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, ithe ki āche paratīti re. "There is no happiness actually, eternal happiness, transcendental happiness, in enjoying this life, or this youthful age, or family, society. There is no happiness, no transcendental happiness."
Therefore kamala-dala-jala, jīvana ṭalamala. "And you do not know how long you shall enjoy this life. Because it is tottering. You are on the tottering platform. Just like there is water on the lily leaf. It is tilting. At any moment it will fall down. So our life is tilting. At any moment it may collapse. We may meet, by chance, any danger, and finished. So don't waste life in that way.'' Bhajahū hari-pada nīti re. "Be always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the success of your life.'' 
And how to discharge this Kṛṣṇa consciousness? He advises, śravaṇa kīrtana, smaraṇa vandana, pāda-sevana dāsya re. You can adopt out of the nine ways of devotional service any one. If you can adopt all of them, that's very nice. If not, you can adopt eight of them. You can adopt seven of them, six of them, five of them, four of them. But even if you adopt only one of them, your life will be successful. What are those nine methods? Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam. Hearing from authoritative sources. And chanting. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam. Smaraṇam. Memorizing. Vandanam, prayers. 
Śravaṇa kīrtanaṁ, smaraṇaṁ vandana. Pāda-sevanam. Offering service to His lotus feet as eternal servant. Pūjana sakhī-jana. Or just try to love Kṛṣṇa as your friend. Ātma-nivedana. Or give up everything for Kṛṣṇa. That is the way of devotional service, and Govinda dāsa is aspiring after that Kṛṣṇa consciousness business.

So this song was sung by Govinda dāsa. Govinda-dāsa-abhilāsa re. What is his desire? Abhilāsa means desire. Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana: “My dear mind...’’ Because mind is our friend and enemy. If you train the mind, then mind is your best friend. And if you cannot train your mind, then it will be your bitterest enemy. Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ [SB 9.4.18]. 
[Mahārāja Ambarīṣa always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kṛṣṇa or about Kṛṣṇa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's temples and Kṛṣṇa's places like Mathurā and Vṛndāvana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasī offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasāda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.]
Therefore, mind has always to be engaged on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then mind automatically will be controlled and will become friend. So Govinda dāsa is expressing his desire: “My dear mind, you just be engaged in devotional service of Nanda-nandana.’’ His..., he does not say Kṛṣṇa. He says Nanda-nandana. Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana. If we address Kṛṣṇa directly, that is not very pleasing, but if we say Kṛṣṇa: Nanda-nandana, Yaśodā-nandana, Devakī-nandana, Pārtha-sārathi—in relationship with His devotee—then He becomes more pleased. 
So bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana. Why Śrī-Nanda-nandana? Now, abhaya-caraṇāravinda re. If you take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, Nanda-nandana, then you’ll have no more anxiety, fear.
samāṣritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ
mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ
bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ
padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām
[SB 10.14.58]
[For those who have accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Murāri, the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoof-print. Their goal is paraṁ padam, Vaikuṇṭha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.]
This is Bhagavat-darśana. Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām. This material world, padaṁ padam means step by step there is danger. So one who takes shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ samāṣritā, for him there is no more danger. Abhaya-caraṇāravinda re. How it is possible to take complete shelter of Kṛṣṇa, which is fearlessness, no anxiety, vaikuṇṭha? Durlabha manava-janama sat-saṅge. This is possible if you associate with devotees. If you think that “Now I have become very much advanced. Now I shall live alone and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura,’’ this is nonsense. You cannot imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. You have to associate with devotees. Durlabha manava-janama sat sange. Sat-sange. Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido [SB 3.25.25]. 
[In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very pleasing and satisfying to the ear and the heart. By cultivating such knowledge one gradually becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is freed, and his attraction becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional service begin.]
If you remain with the devotees, then by their association, by talking with them, you’ll get real understanding of God consciousness. It is very practical to understand. Just like in material world there are many associations, societies. Businessmen, they have got their Stock Exchange association. Those who are dealing in exchange, they have got an association. They go there, and their business facility is very good. Similarly, so many clubs. If you want to drink and enjoy sense, you go to so many clubs and associate with them and you’ll learn how to drink, how to mate very nicely. So association is very important thing. Therefore, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, we are giving chance people to associate with us so that they will be able to understand what is Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. 
Therefore Govinda dāsa recommends, durlabha mānava-janama-sat-saṅge. Mānava. This human life is durlabha, very rarely obtained. Not dogs’ association, crows’ association, but swans’ association. There are association even by nature. “Birds of the same feather flock together.’’ Crows, they’ll mix with crows, and the swans will mix with swan. White swan in very nice water, nice garden, they will like that. The crows will not like that. The crows will like where filthy things are thrown away. They’ll take pleasure there. 
So similarly, according to the quality of nature, there are different association in human society. So it is recommended that durlabha mānava sat-saṅge: not with the crows but with the swans. You give the swan milk and water, it will take the milk portion and give it up the water portion. Similarly a swan, a haṁsa, paramahaṁsa means in this human form of life, one who takes the spiritual portion of life and rejects the material portion of life, he is called haṁsa, paramahaṁsa. We are mixed. Our body is material, but I am spirit soul. So we have to know the techniques how to get out of this material bondage. 
It will come out from this material body, but when it comes out, then it will vanquish the material body. Very good example. The fire, there is..., in the wood there is fire, everyone knows. So you ignite fire, and if you make it dry, then the fire takes place very quickly. And when it is blazing fire, then the wood becomes vanquished. There is no more existence of the wood. Similarly, if you can invoke your spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, when it will be very nicely going on, then your material existence will be finished. This is the process. Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge taraha e bhava-sindhu re. In this way, just get on the other side of this ocean of nescience.
Then, one may say that “If I associate with the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, then how my family affairs will go on? Who will look after my wife and children, society, friendship, love? I have got so many business.’’ Therefore he says, śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa ei dina jāminī jāgi re: “My dear mind, you are working so hard.’’ Śīta ātapa. “In severe cold you are going to work. In scorching heat you are going to work. Torrents of rain... You cannot stop your work.’’ Śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa. “Night duty, whole night working.’’ People are doing that. Śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa ei dina jāminī jāgi re. Whole day work, again I’ll get some more money, I’ll let you work at night also, extra. In this way we are working. Why you are working? Why you are working?
śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa
ei dina jāminī jāgi re
biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana
capala sukha labha lāgi’ re
“In this way I have wasted my time,’’ biphale sevinu, “to serve kṛpana durajana, some so-called society, friendship and love. Kṛpaṇa, they will not...never be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but I am engaged in their service.’’ So this is general, not that every, every family. Mostly 99.9. So biphale sevinu, “In this way I am wasting my time. And what is the pleasure?’’ Capala sukha-labha lāgi’ re. “Few  Minutes sex, that’s all.’’ Behind this sex, so many labor. Therefore, Govinda dāsa says that “You are trying to enjoy wealth,’’ ei-dhana, yauvana, putra, parijana. Material happiness means to acquire money, dhana; and then jana, many adherents or dependents—wife, children, friends, society, so many things, country. So putra, parijana, ithe ki āche paratīti re. “You cannot have any transcendental bliss in this.’’ 
Kamala-jala-dala, jīvana ṭalamala. The life is tottering. You cannot say when the life will be finished. The example is given, kamala-jala-dala. Just like lotus leaf. If you put water on the leaf, it will not stay, it will be tiltering. At any moment it slips. Similarly, our life is like that, tiltering. At any moment—finished. Kamala-jala-dala, jivana..., bhajahu hari-pada nīti re. Therefore, engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness as much as you can finish before the death comes. That is your mission. And what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Śravana, kīrtana, smarana, vandana, pāda-sevana, pūjana, sakhī-jana, ātma-nivedana, the nine kinds of devotional service, govinda-dāsa-abhilāṣa re.
So everyone should desire like Govinda dāsa. Śravana kīrtana, these are the devotional process: hearing; chanting; remembering; arcana, worshiping the Deity; vandana, offering prayer. There are nine kinds. So human life is meant for this purpose. And by this process, gradually we ignite the fire of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or spiritual consciousness. Then, by that fire, as by blazing fire the wood itself becomes burnt into ashes, so our, all of our covering... The spirit soul is covered by matter, by ignorance. So this covering and ignorance will be burnt into ashes, and you’ll become free and go back to home, back to Godhead. This is the purport of this song.

Bhajahū Re Mana & Purport 3
Prabhupāda: Hear carefully. Just try to hear, then... 
[sings Bhajahū Re Mana, accompanied by karatālas] 

bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana
abhaya-caraṇāravinda re
durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge
taroho e bhava-sindhu re
[O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the son of Nanda, which make one fearless. Having obtained this rare human birth, cross over this ocean of worldly existence by associating with saintly persons.]
śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa
e dina jāminī jāgi re
biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana
capala sukha-laba lāgi' re
[Day and night I remain sleepless, suffering heat and cold, wind and rain. For a bit of flickering happiness I have vainly served wicked and miserly men.]
e dhana, yaubana, putra, parijana
ithe ki āche paratīti re
kamala-dala-jala, jīvana ṭalamala
bhajahū hari-pada nīti re
[What assurance of real happiness is there in all one’s wealth, youth, sons, and relatives? This life totters like a drop of water on a lotus petal; therefore you should always worship the lotus feet of Lord Hari.]
śravaṇa, kīrtana, smaraṇa, vandana,
pāda-sevana, dāsya re
pūjana, sakhī-jana, ātma-nivedana
govinda-dāsa-abhilāṣa re
[Govinda Dāsa longs to hear the glories of Lord Hari, chant His glories, constantly remember Him, offer Him prayers, serve His lotus feet, become His servant, worship Him, serve Him as a friend, and completely offer Him his very self.]

This is a song which a devotee is praying and asking his mind, bhajahū re mana. Mana means mind. Because, at the present moment, our mind is the driver, and this body is just like a car. In the Bhagavad-gītā also it is stated, bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg 18.61], this body is a car made of this material nature. 
[The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.]
The living entity, what is said "I," I am now seated on this car prepared by the nature, material nature. And the driver is the mind. And the driver is not in my control. The driver is taking me anywhere he likes. You see? I am... Personally, I am not able to drive. I have engaged one driver, which is called the mind, and this body is the car, and the mind is carrying me...
Woman: Like driver. 
Prabhupāda: ...like driver, anywhere it likes. So therefore the proprietor, I, I am, I am requesting the driver... When I am helpless, so I am requesting, "My dear mind," bhajahū re mana, "my dear mind..." Mana means mind. "You kindly worship Lord Kṛṣṇa." Śrī-nanda-nandana. Śrī-nanda-nandana means Lord Kṛṣṇa. 
Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Vasudeva, and He was accepted by Nanda Mahārāja as his..., what is called? Son who is accepted from others? So he, he was His foster father. So he's reques... "I am requesting that you worship Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is abhaya-caraṇa." Abhaya-caraṇa means He's the fearless shelter. If we take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, then we become free from all anxieties. Just like a helpless child, when he's taken care of by his parents, he becomes careless..., carefree, not careless. Carefree. "Similarly, I am requesting, my dear mind, 'You do not drive in this way, dangerously. Please worship Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is fearless shelter.' " Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraṇāravinda re: "His lotus feet is fearless shelter."
One who takes shelter... As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg 18.66]. 
[Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.]
Now, either you say Kṛṣṇa or you say superconsciousness... Superconsciousness is impersonal conception of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is personal conception of superconsciousness. Because Kṛṣṇa means He's not only superconscious, but He's supreme bliss and supreme knowledge—supreme knowledge means superconsciousness—and eternal, supreme consciousness, supreme bliss. That is the definition of Kṛṣṇa.
Now, then the devotee says that durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge taroho e bhava-sindhu re. Now, this body, this human body, is durlabha. Durlabha means very valuable. It is obtained with..., after a great struggle of existence. We have to come through so many species of life: aquatics, birds, then trees, then reptiles, then beasts... There are so many. So many. There are eighty-four lakhs, means 8,400,000 species of life, and we had to pass through by gradual evolution. This theory is accepted by Darwin also, evolutionary theory. So this human body is very valuable. 
So he requests, "My dear mind..." Mind, of course, the..., in the lower animal life the mind is there also. Also mind is not developed, but they have got mind. It is a... In the very lower animal living condition, the mind is not at all developed, but at least, in animal life, there is mind. Now, the devotee requesting that "This life, this human form of life, is very valuable. Don't waste it. Don't waste it, but you just to make your life successful in the association of saints and sages."
Woman: What?
Prabhupāda: Saints. Saints. S-a-i-n-t-s. Saints and sages.
Woman: No, no.
Prabhupāda: You have no saint?
Girl: Saints and sages, s-a-i...
Woman: Saints?
Prabhupāda: Saints.
Woman: Oh, saints and sages.
Prabhupāda: Yes. Saints and sages. You see? "So you should not make association with anybody else, but you make your association only with saints and sages and make your this valuable human form of life successful. Don't waste your time. You worship Lord Kṛṣṇa with the help of the saints and sages and make your life successful." That he is requesting. "Don't drive in this irresponsible way to put me into the ocean." 
And it is also requested that "We are just like in the ocean of birth and death." This material cosmic situation is sometimes explained as the ocean, and these planets, they are explained as islands. And actually, they are islands in the air. Just like we have got islands in the sea and ocean, similarly, these planets are islands in the air, air islands, so many planets.
So he says that durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge tara e bhava-sindhu re. Bhava-sindhu. Bhava-sindhu means this cosmic situation where birth and death is going on continually, one after another. "So you stop this business of repeated birth and death. You make your this human form of life successful and get release from this disease of birth and death." Birth and death is a sort of disease for the living entity. It is not the normal condition. Due to our this abnormal encagement in the material body, we are put into the birth and death. Otherwise, I am not subjected to birth and death. I am eternal. I am eternal. 
So he is requested that "Don't waste your time, my dear mind." Because mind is taking me here and there. So he's requesting mind. It is very philosophical. This is concentration, requesting the mind, "Don't put me into the ocean of birth and death. Please save me, and just make your life successful in the association of saints and sages. That is my request." 
Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana. So worship, worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa or the Supreme Lord and, at the same time, association of saints and sages, that makes our life successful. Association of good persons and, at the same time, simultaneously, devotional service to the Lord. These two things combinedly can make our life successful.
Woman: How do you call devotion to the Lord?
Prabhupāda: Eh? Yes. Lord... We worship Kṛṣṇa, the symbol of supreme consciousness. Because in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that kleśa adhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām [Bg 12.5]. 
[For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.]
If you take up impersonal, simply consciousness, then you have to pass through difficult process. But if you accept the symbol, Kṛṣṇa, the symbol of supreme consciousness, that will be easier for you. Yes. It is said. So Kṛṣṇa... I can concentrate my mind. I can focus my mental activities in the service of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Because He is supreme consciousness, therefore automatically I concentrate on the supreme consciousness. 
So,
bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana-
abhaya-caraṇāravinda re
durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge
taroho e bhava-sindhu re
[O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the son of Nanda, which make one fearless. Having obtained this rare human birth, cross over this ocean of worldly existence by associating with saintly persons.]
Then he says that "What I am doing? What is my present occupation?" The present occupation is,
śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa
e dina jāminī jāgi re
biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana
capala sukha-laba lāgi' re
[Day and night I remain sleepless, suffering heat and cold, wind and rain. For a bit of flickering happiness I have vainly served wicked and miserly men.]
He says that "I am working hard, day and night. And there is no question of winter or summer or rainy season. I have to work hard, day and night. If there is night duty in the winter season, I have to join my office at twelve o'clock at night. So I must go. There is snowfall. If I don't go, then I'll be absent. So I am working so hard, very hard.'' Śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa, jāminī jāgi re. 
"And what for I am working?'' Now, biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana: "Just to serve persons who cannot protect me." "Who cannot protect me.'' We think that my wife or my husband or my children or my relatives or my friends and, oh, so many we have got, relationship with this material world... And everyone is working to satisfy his relatives. A family man is working so hard because he has to satisfy his wife, children, friends and so many other person. But one should be conscious that "These friends and relatives, they cannot protect me ultimately. They are... Neither I can protect them, nor they can protect me.'' You see? 
Everyone responsible. Everyone is responsible for his own activity. Besides that... Now, suppose if I am constructing a high building, skyscrapers—just like you have got very good experience in this country—if somebody asks me that "Why you are building so high building? What is the reason?'' and if I answer, "Just to set fire it it,'' then the..., the man will laugh: "You, simply for setting fire, you are spending so much money and building this high building for setting fire?'' "Yes.'' 
So this sort of answer is just like in our present activities. Now, of course, you take the dead bodies to the crematorium and, I mean to say, put into the grave. But India... In India, of course, there is graveyard for the Muhammadans and the Christians, but the Hindus, they burn the dead body. They burn the dead body. You see? In the Bhāgavata also, these three system are recorded, that the ultimate transformation of this body will be either ashes, stool or earth.
Woman: Earth...
Prabhupāda: Earth...
Woman: ...stool...
Prabhupāda: ...stool or ashes. How it is? Now, because after death, persons who burn the dead body, that is turned into ashes. This body, this beautiful body, will be turned into ashes. And those who bury in the graveyard, that will turn into... 
[aside:] Oh, that is air. Don't disturb yourself. That is the air. 
If we bury in the ground, gradually the body will turn into earth. And according to Iranian system, the body is thrown to the vultures. They eat it. So that will be turned into animal stool. You see? So that is the last stage of this body. 
So everyone knows that everyone will die. Still, we are working so hard. We are making our bank balance, we are just making will and papers just to give protection to our family or to our children, and there is no time. Everyone is very busy in this. But he does not see that "All these, what I am doing, all these body ultimately become either ash or animal stool or turn into earth. So why I am taking so much trouble?" 
Therefore the revealed scripture advises that "You have to maintain your body. That's all right. But for simply material comforts you should not devote time more than it is absolutely required." That means don't increase your bodily necessities. Don't increase your bodily necessities. 
That was the standard of Indian civilization. They did not, the sages and saints, they did not advise to increase the necessities of the body. They, I mean to say, planned the social system in such a way that people should be satisfied only for..., by the bare necessities of life. We require some eating, we require some sleeping, or shelter place, and we require some sense gratification and we require some protection from enemies. 
[aside:] Yes? Come. Ah-hah! Ah, ah-hah, ah-hah! [indistinct name] Come in. Come in. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraṇāravinda re. Bhaja, bhaja means worship; hu, hello; mana, mind. The poet Govinda dāsa, a great philosopher and a devotee of the Lord, he is praying. He is requesting his mind, because mind is the friend and mind is the enemy of everyone. If one can train his mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he is successful. If he cannot train his mind, then his life is failure. Therefore, Govinda dāsa, a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa... His very name suggests, Govinda dāsa. Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, and dāsa means servant. 
This is the attitude of all devotees. They always put, affix this dāsa, means servant. So Govinda dāsa is praying, “My dear mind, please you try to worship the son of Nanda, who is abhaya-caraṇa, whose lotus feet is secure. There is no fear.” Abhaya. Abhaya means there is no fear, and caraṇa, caraṇa means lotus feet. So he is advising his mind, “My dear mind, please you engage yourself in worshiping the fearless lotus feet of the son of Nanda.” Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana. Nanda-nandana means a son of Nanda Mahārāja, Kṛṣṇa. And His lotus feet is abhaya, fearless. So Govinda dāsa is requesting his mind, “Please be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.” 
So far other things are concerned... And he says also that durlabha mānava-janama. Durlabha means very rare to obtain. Mānava-janma means this human form of life. It comes after a very long rotation. Once chance is given to become Kṛṣṇa conscious so that one may get out of the cycle of birth and death. Therefore he advises that this life, this human form of life, is very important, durlabha. Durlabha means... Duḥ means with great difficulty, and labha means obtainable. 
So foolish people, they do not know what, how much important this human form of life. They are simply wasting in sense gratification like animals. So this is very instructing, that he is training his mind that “You engage your mind in the worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa.” Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge. And this training of the mind is possible only in good association, sat-saṅga. Sat-saṅga means persons who are simply cent per cent engaged in the service of the Lord. They are called sat. Satāṁ prasaṅgāt. 
Without association of devotees, it is impossible to train the mind. It is not possible by the so-called yoga system or meditation. One has to associate with devotees; otherwise it is not possible. Therefore, we have formed this Kṛṣṇa consciousness society so that one may take advantage of this association. So Govinda dāsa, poet and devotee, is advising, durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge: “You have got this very nice, rare human body. Now associate with devotees and engage your mind on the fearless lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.” He is requesting his mind.
Then he is pointing out the frustration of life. What is that? Śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa e dina jāminī jāgi re. Śīta means winter. Ātapa means summer, when there is scorching sunshine, ātapa. Śīta ātapa. Bāta, cold, bariṣaṇa, torrents of rain. So these disturbances are always there. Sometimes it is severe cold, sometimes it is scorching heat, sometimes there is torrents of rain, sometimes this or that is going on. 
So he says, śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa e dina jāminī jāgi re. Whole day and night, people are working very hard without caring, severe cold, severe heat, and torrents of rain, and keeping night [duty], going to the desert, going underneath the sea—everywhere they are so busy. Śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa e dina jāminī jāgi re. There is night duty and so many other engagements. So he says,
śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa
e dina jāminī jāgi re
biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana
capala sukha-laba lāgi’ re
“Now, with all this hard labor, what I have done? I have served some persons who are not at all favorable to my Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And why I have served them?” Capala sukha-laba lāgi’ re. Capala, very flickering happiness. “I think if my small child smiles, I will be happy. I think if my wife is pleased, I think I am happy. But all this temporary smiling or feeling of happiness, they are all flickering.” That one has to realize. 
There are many other poets also similarly have sung that this is..., this mind is just like a desert, and it is hankering after oceans of water. In a desert, if a ocean is transferred, then it can be inundated. And what benefit can be achieved there if drop of water is there? Similarly, our mind, our consciousness, is hankering after ocean of happiness. And this temporary happiness in family life, in society life, they are just like drop of water. So those who are philosophers, those who have actually studied the world situation, they can understand that “This flickering happiness cannot make me happy.”
Then he says, kamala-dala-jala, jīvana talamala. Kamala-dala-jala means the lily, lily flower. You have all seen lily flower on the lakes. They are tottering, always in the water. Tottering. Any way, any time, it can be overflooded. Similarly, this life is full of danger always, always in danger. Any moment it can be finished. There are so many instances. People look it, but they forget. That is the wonderful thing. They are seeing every day, every moment, that he is himself in danger, others are in danger. Still, he is thinking that “I am secure.’’ This is the position. 
So life is very tottering and in dangerous position. Therefore, one should take advantage of this human form of life and immediately engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That should be the request of everyone to his mind, “My dear mind, don’t drag me in the dangerous position. Please keep me in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.’’ Thus Kṛṣṇa consciousness, how it can be achieved, that is also being described by Govinda dāsa. He says,
śravaṇa, kīrtana, smaraṇa, vandana,
pāda-sevana, dāsya re,
pūjana, sakhī-jana, ātma-nivedana
govinda-dāsa-abhilāṣa re
Abhilāṣa means aspiration, hope, or ambition. He is ambitious of becoming a devotee in nine different ways. The first thing is śravaṇa. Śravaṇa means hearing. One has to hear from authorities. That is the beginning of spiritual life or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like Arjuna. He achieved his spiritual consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by hearing from Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, one has to hear from Kṛṣṇa or from the representative of Kṛṣṇa. One who presents Kṛṣṇa’s words as it is—from him one has to hear because at the present moment we have no opportunity to hear directly. 
To hear directly from Kṛṣṇa is there. The arrangement is there. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone’s heart, and one can hear from Him very easily, anywhere and everywhere, but he must have the training how to hear. For that purpose one requires the help of the representative of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that one can achieve devotional service of Kṛṣṇa by the combined mercy of Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master. Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja [Cc Madhya 19.151]. 
[”According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. By the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.]
By the grace of spiritual master, guru, and by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, one achieves the opportunity of serving Kṛṣṇa in devotional service. So in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta it is also said that spiritual master is the direct manifestation of Kṛṣṇa. 
Kṛṣṇa comes before the devotee as spiritual master just like sun enters your room by the sunshine. Although the sun does not enter your room or your city or your country—he is so many millions and millions of miles away—still, he can enter everywhere by his potency, the sunshine. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa enters everywhere by His different potencies. And to receive this light from Kṛṣṇa, one has to hear. Hearing is so important. Therefore Govinda dāsa says, śravaṇa. Śravaṇa means hearing. And one who has heard nicely, his next stage will be kīrtanam. Just like our boys who have heard a little nicely, now they are very eager to chant, going from street to street. 
This is natural sequence. It is not that you hear, but you remain stopped. No. The next stage will be kīrtanam. Either by chanting vibration or by writing or by speaking or by preaching, the kīrtana will be there. So śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam, first hearing and then chanting. And hearing and chanting about whom? About Viṣṇu, not for any nonsense. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB 7.5.23]. 
[Prahlāda Mahārāja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
These things are stated in the śāstra. The ordinary people, they are also engaged in hearing and chanting. They are hearing in the newspaper of some politician, and the whole day they are discussing and chanting, “Oh, this man is going to be elected. This man is going to ...’’ 
So hearing and chanting is there everywhere. But if you want spiritual salvation, then you have to hear and chant about Viṣṇu, nobody else. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ. So the poet sings, śravaṇa, kīrtana, smaraṇa, vandana, pāda-sevana, dāsya re. So there are different processes: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping in the temple, engaging oneself in the service. So he is desiring all nine kinds of devotional service. Ultimately, pūjana sakhī-jana. Sakhī-jana means those who are confidential devotees of the Lord, to please them. And ātma-nivedana. Ātmā means self, and nivedana means surrender. Govinda-dāsa-abhilāṣa. 
The poet’s name is Govinda dāsa, and he expresses that his desires are only this. He wants to utilize the opportunity of his human form of life in this way. This is the sum and substance of this song.

[It is the desire and great longing of Govinda Dāsa to engage himself in the nine processes of bhakti, namely hearing the glories of Lord Hari and chanting those glories, constantly remembering Him and offering prayers to Him, serving the Lord's lotus feet, serving the Supreme Lord as a servant, worshiping Him with flowers and incense and so forth, serving Him as a friend, and completely offering the Lord one's very self.]
Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana-abhaya caraṇāravinda re. This is a song sung by Govinda dāsa, poet Govinda dāsa. He's addressing his mind, because, after all, we have to work with the cooperation of our mind. If our mind is disturbed, if the mind is dragging us to choose something else, then it is very difficult to concentrate in one sort of business. That is practical. Therefore the yoga system means to control the mind. It is a mechanical process of controlling the mind. 
Because without controlling the mind, without the mind being disturbed, without the mind being not disturbed, nobody can make any spiritual progress. But our Vaiṣṇava system is to engage the mind directly in devotional service so that it may not go outside the scope of devotional service. That is our system. And that is practical. If we concentrate our mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, arcanam-śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam-pāda-sevanam [SB 7.5.23], then automatically mind becomes controlled. 
[Prahlāda Mahārāja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
The yogis are trying artificially to control the mind, but they are failing. There are many instances big, big yogis fail. So anything done artificially is not possible to be perfectly done. Therefore the system of controlling the mind means you give the mind better engagement, then mind will not be attracted by inferior energy. This is the science or secret of success.
So Govinda dāsa is trying to fix up the mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa which is known as abhaya-caraṇa. Abhaya means "where there is no fear.'' Just like we deposit our money in a reliable bank because we think there is no fear of loss. That is called abhaya, "without any fear,'' and caraṇa means "lotus feet.'' 
So Govinda dāsa is advising his mind, hū re mana "My dear mind,'' hū re addressing the mind. Bhaja hū re mana. Bhaja. Bhaja means "be engaged in devotional service.'' Bhaja hū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana, "in the service of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda.'' There are many, many Kṛṣṇas, but we are concerned with the particular Kṛṣṇa who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahārāja and the son of Vāsudeva. Therefore he says particularly just like we identify one person his name, his father's name, then it is perfectly identified. 
So, he says śrī nanda-nandana; bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana abhaya-caraṇāravinda re, "His Lotus Feet is secure to take shelter of.'' There are many ślokas in the Bhāgavatam about this: samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavam mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ [SB 10.14.58]. 
[For those who have accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Murāri, the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoof-print. Their goal is paraṁ padam, Vaikuṇṭha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.]
Mahat-padam, "Under the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa, the whole material creation is resting.'' So if such a gigantic creation can rest, so if I am insignificant tiny living being, if I take shelter at the Lotus Feet, which is fearless, of Kṛṣṇa, then my security is guaranteed. Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana, abhaya caraṇā-ravinda re, durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge, taroho e bhava-sindhu re. Durlabha, "very rarely got this human form of life.'' Durlabha mānava-janama. 
So in order to fix up our mind on the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa, it is necessary that we should live in the association of devotees. Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge. Sat-saṅge means "in the association of devotees.'' If we don't live in the association of devotees, if we try to fix up our mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa independently, it will be not possible. It will be failure. Therefore he says sat-saṅge, "in the association of devotees." Taroho e bhava-sindhu re, "the real purpose of life is to cross over the ocean of nescience.'' 
So if we fix up our mind on the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa in the association of devotees, then we can very easily cross over the ocean of nescience, the material existence. Then, what is my present business? Now my present business is: śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa, e dina jāminī jāgi re. My material engagement is that "I don't care for severe cold, I don't care for scorching heat, I don't care for sleeping at night; I am working hard day and night.'' 
Śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa, e dina jāminī jāgi re. And what for? Kṛpaṇa, bhipale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana, "for the service of kṛpaṇa dura-jana.'' Kṛpaṇa durajana means outsiders. The so-called material society, friendship, love, etc., they are actually outsiders. They can not give me actual spiritual advancement of life. But we are engaged in the service of society, friendship, or love, nationalism, socialism, so many. 
Our engagements are various, but that is biphale. Biphale means "without any result.'' Result will be that I create a certain type of mentality in order to protect the so-called country, society, family, and at the time of death I will have to accept a body according to my mentality. So people are accepting so many abominable means to carry on this business of society, friendship, and love, so-called. The result is that he is developing a certain type of mentality which is not human, and the result will be next life he'll be forced to accept a body according to that mentality. 
Therefore kṛpaṇa durajana. Kṛpaṇa means "miser.'' They'll not give me any intelligence, any enlightenment of my real need of life, but still we are engaged in the service of such durajana, "outsider.'' Biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana, capala sukha-laba lāgi' re, and there is little happiness. Otherwise, how a man can work so hard day and night. The happiness is sex enjoyment, capala, "flickering.'' 
Vidyapati sings, tatala saikate vari bindu-sama, "That happiness is just like a drop of water in the desert.'' Desert requires water but if you take little water and sprinkle over it, "Now take water,'' so what is the value of that water? Similarly, we are hankering after eternal happiness, what these society, friendship and love will give us? 
Therefore we are simply wasting our time in the matter of deriving happiness from this so-called materialistic way of life maintaining society, friendship and so forth, simply wasting. Biphale. Biphale means "without any good result.'' Biphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana, capala sukha-laba lāgi' re. "Never mind, I shall enjoy personally. I've got my youthful life, I can earn money, and I don't care for my family.'' 
Actually this is now happening at the present moment. Nobody cares for family, but he is busy only for maintaining himself, to utilize his youthful life, and so many things. Govinda Dāsa poet is advising, "My dear mind, I accept that now you have got youthful life, you can enjoy.'' Therefore, you say e dhana yaubana putra parijana, ithe ki āche paratīti re, "this accumulation of wealth: earning money; and this youthful life: enjoying.'' 
E dhana yaubana putra parijana, and by society, friendship and love, do you think is there any actual happiness or transcendental happiness? Ithe ki āche paratīti re, "It is something like the water on the lotus leaf.'' Kamala-dala-jala, jīvana ṭalamala, "It is this existence of water is tiltering, at any moment will fall down.'' Actually, all of this youthful enjoyment or money-making business, at any moment it can be finished. So actually you can not believe or bring your faith in that sort of happiness. That is not good because it can be finished at any moment. These people are engaged in making skyscraper buildings, and bank balance, and having good motorcars, and so many things they are trying to enjoy, but forgetting that any moment it can be finished. Any moment. 
So it is just like kamala-dala-jala, "keeping water on the lotus leaf.'' It does not stand, it is tilted, can fall down, any moment. The example is very nice. Therefore he's advising, śravaṇa kīrtana, he is instructing the mind that, "don't do this, don't do this,'' so many negative things. Then the next question will be then actually, mind may ask Govinda Dāsa, "Actually what do you want to do? You are negativating all these material engagements that's all right, then what is your positive proposal?'' He says, "Yes, my positive proposal is this: śravaṇa kīrtana smaraṇa vandana, pāda-sevana dāsya re, pūjana sakhī-jana ātma-nivedana, govinda dāsa-abhilāṣa re." "My dear mind, my desire is that you kindly help me hearing about this abhaya-caraṇāravinda, Kṛṣṇa, śravaṇa. 
And let me chant about His glories, śravaṇa kīrtana. Let me remember, let me serve His Lotus Feet, let me make friendship with Him. Offer, let me offer everything what have I got to Him. These are my desires. If you kindly cooperate with me, and then I can do this.'' So this is a very instructive song, the summary of the mission of human life, and anyone who will follow this principle will be actually happy transcendentally.

When the spirit soul renders service unto the Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and, simply by being employed in the service of the Lord, one's senses are purified.]

Relief from material distress-

Sinful reactions are explained thus-
(1.1.19)
aprārabdhaṁ bhavet pāpaṁ
prārabdhaṁ ceti tad dvidhā
[There are two kinds of sinful reactions. Potential sinful reactions are called aprārabdha and manifest sinful reactions are known as prārabdha.] 
tatrāprārabdha-haratvaṁ yathaikādaśe (SB 11.14.19)-
In connection with the destruction of potential sinful reactions, there is the following statement in the Eleventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:
(1.1.20)
yathāgniḥ susamṛddhārciḥ
karoty edhāṁsi bhasmasāt
tathā mad-viṣayā bhaktir
uddhavaināṁsi kṛtsnaśaḥ
[As all fuel is burned to ashes by a full-fledged fire, all sinful activities are totally erased when one engages in devotional service to Me.] 
prārabdha-haratvaṁ yathā tṛtīye (SB 3.33.6)-
The destruction of manifest sinful reactions is described in the Third Canto as follows:
(1.1.21)
yan-nāmadheya-śravaṇānukīrtanād
yat-prahvaṇād yat-smaraṇād api kvacit
śvādo 'pi sadyaḥ savanāya kalpate
kutaḥ punas te bhagavan nu darśanāt
[To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.]
(1.1.22)
durjātir eva savanā-
'yogyatve kāraṇaṁ matam
durjāty ārambhakaṁ pāpaṁ 
yat syāt prārabdham eva tat
[Low birth is thought to be the cause of one's disqualification to perform the soma sacrifice. That sinful activity, however, which caused the low birth, is known as prārabdha.]
padma-purāṇe ca-
The Padma Purāṇa says:
(1.1.23)
aprārabdha-phalaṁ pāpaṁ
kūṭaṁ bījaṁ phalonmukham
krameṇaiva pralīyeta
viṣṇu-bhakti-ratātmanām
[There are different stages of dormant reactions to sinful activities to be observed in a sinful life. Sinful reactions may be just waiting to take effect [phalonmukha], reactions may be still further dormant [kūṭa], or the reactions may be in a seedlike state [bīja]. In any case, all types of sinful reactions are vanquished one after another if a person engages in the devotional service of Lord Viṣṇu.]
bīja-haratvaṁ yathā ṣaṣṭhe (SB 6.2.17)-
In the Sixth Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the removal of seedlike sinful desires is described:
(1.1.24)
tais tāny aghāni pūyante
tapo-dāna-vratādibhiḥ
nādharmajaṁ tad-dhṛdayaṁ
tad apīśāṅghri-sevayā
[Although one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows and other such methods, these pious activities cannot uproot the material desires in one's heart. However, if one serves the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, he is immediately freed from all such contaminations.]
avidyā-haratvaṁ yathā caturthe [SB 4.22.39]-
The destruction of ignorance is described in the Fourth Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as follows:
(1.1.25)
yat-pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa-vilāsa-bhaktyā
karmāśayaṁ grathitam udgrathayanti santaḥ
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo 'pi ruddha-
sroto-gaṇās tam araṇaṁ bhaja vāsudevam
[The devotees, who are always engaged in the service of the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, can very easily overcome hard-knotted desires for fruitive activities. Because this is very difficult, the nondevotees-the jṣānīs and yogīs-although trying to stop the waves of sense gratification, cannot do so. Therefore you are advised to engage in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva.]
pādme ca-
In the Padma Purāṇa it is also said:
(1.1.26)
kṛtānuyātrā vidyābhir
hari-bhaktir anuttamā
avidyāṁ nirdahaty āśu
dāva-jvāleva pannagīm
[Pure devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest enlightenment, and when such enlightenment is there, it is just like a blazing forest fire, killing all the inauspicious snakes of desire.]
śubhadatvam-
All-auspiciousness-
(1.1.27)
śubhāni prīṇanaṁ sarva-
jagatām anuraktatā
sad-guṇāḥ sukham ity ādīny
ākhyātāni manīṣibhiḥ
[Learned sages have described the meaning of auspiciousness as: love for the entire creation, caring affection for all living entities, saintly character, happiness, and other such qualities.]
tatra jagat-prīṇanādi-dvaya-pradatvaṁ, yathā pādme-
In connection with making the whole world happy and being affectionate toward all living entities, the following statement is found in the Padma Purāṇa:

yenārcito haris tena
tarpitāni jaganty api
rajyanti jantavas tatra
jaṅgamāḥ sthāvarā api
[A person who is engaged in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to be understood to be doing the best service to the whole world and to be pleasing everyone in the world. In addition to human society, he is pleasing even the trees and animals, because they also become attracted by such activities.]
sad-guṇādi-pradatvaṁ yathā paṣcame (SB 5.18.12)-
How godly qualities are developed by devotional service is described in the Fifth Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:
(1.1.29)
yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiṣcanā
sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ
harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā
manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ
[All the demigods and their exalted qualities, such as religion, knowledge and renunciation, become manifest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?]
sukha-pradatvaṁ-
Devotional service as giver of happiness -
(1.1.30)
sukhaṁ vaiṣayikaṁ brāhmam
aiśvaraṁ ceti tat tridhā
[Happiness from material enjoyment, happiness from identification with Brahman and happiness derived from Kṛṣṇa consciousness, are the three categories of happiness.]
yathā tantre-
As stated by Lord Śiva in the tantra-śāstra-
(1.1.31)
siddhayaḥ paramāścaryā
bhuktir muktiś ca śāśvatī
nityaṁ ca paramānandaṁ
bhaved govinda-bhaktitaḥ
[My dear wife, a person who has surrendered himself at the lotus feet of Govinda and who has thus developed pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be very easily awarded all the perfections desired by the impersonalists; and beyond this, he can enjoy the happiness achieved by the pure devotees.]
hari-bhakti-sudhodaye ca-
In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya Prahlāda Mahārāja prays to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva-
(1.1.32)
bhūyo 'pi yāce deveśa 
tvayi bhaktir dṛḍhāstu me
yā mokṣānta catur-varga-
phaladā sukhadā latā
[My dear Lord, I repeatedly pray unto Your lotus feet that I may simply be stronger in devotional service. I simply pray that my Kṛṣṇa consciousness may be more strong and steady, because happiness derived out of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service is so powerful that with it one can have all the other perfections of religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and even the attainment of liberation from material existence.]
mokṣa-laghutā-kṛt-
Devotional service minimizes the importance of liberation-
(1.1.33)
manāg eva prarūḍhāyāṁ
hṛdaye bhagavad-ratau
puruṣārthās tu catvāras
tṛṇāyante samantataḥ
[When even a little attachment to Kṛṣṇa arises in a person's heart, then religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation become as insignificant as straw.]
yathā nārada-paṣcaratre-
In the Nārada Paṣcarātra it is stated:
(1.1.34)
hari-bhakti-mahā-devyāḥ
sarvā mukhyādi siddhayaḥ
bhuktayaś cādbhutās tasyāś
ceṭikāvad anuvratāḥ
[The wonderful pleasures derived from the main mystic perfections are afraid of Hari-bhakti-mahā-devī, pure devotional service to Lord Hari, and they become her faithful attendants.]
sudurlabhā-
Devotional service is rarely achieved-
(1.1.35)
sādhanaughair anāsaṅgair
alabhyā sucirād api
hariṇā cāśv adeyeti
dvidhā sā syāt sudurlabhā
[Devotional perfection is very difficult to attain for two reasons. First, unless one is attached to Kṛṣṇa, he cannot attain devotional perfection even if he renders devotional service for a long time. Second, Kṛṣṇa does not easily deliver perfection in devotional service.]
tatrādyā, yathā tantre-
The exalted position of devotional service is described in the tantra-śāstra-
(1.1.36)
jṣānataḥ su-labhā muktir
bhuktir yajṣādi-puṇyataḥ
seyaṁ sādhana-sāhasrair
hāri-bhaktiḥ su-durlabhā
[By cultivating philosophical knowledge one can understand his spiritual position and thus be liberated, and by performing sacrifices and pious activities one can achieve sense gratification in a higher planetary system, but the devotional service of the Lord is so rare that even by executing hundreds and thousands of such sacrifices one cannot obtain it.]
dvitīyā yathā paṣcama skandhe (SB 5.6.18)-
This is further supported by the following statement in the Fifth Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam—
(1.1.37)
rājan patir gurur alaṁ bhavatāṁ yadūnāṁ
daivaṁ priyaḥ kula-patiḥ kva ca kiṅkaro vaḥ
astv evam aṅga bhagavān bhajatāṁ mukundo
muktiṁ dadāti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam
[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: My dear King, the Supreme Person, Mukunda, is actually the maintainer of all the members of the Pāṇḍava and Yadu dynasties. He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the Lord's favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to render direct service unto Him.]
sāndrānanda-viśeṣātmā yathā-
The happiness of becoming one with the Supreme-
(1.1.38)
brahmānando bhaved eṣa
cet parārdha-guṇī-kṛtaḥ
naiti bhakti-sukhāmbhodheḥ
paramāṇu-tulām api
[If brahmānanda, the transcendental bliss derived from understanding impersonal Brahman, were multiplied a million times, such a quantity of brahmānanda could not compare with even an atomic portion of the pleasure relished in pure devotional service.]
yathā hari-bhakti-sudhodaye-
In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya, Prahlāda Mahārāja prays to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva as follows:
(1.1.39)
tvat-sākṣāt-karaṇāhlāda-
viśuddhābdhi-sthitasya me
sukhāni goṣpadāyante
brāhmāṇy api jagad-guro
[My dear Lord, O master of the universe, since I have directly seen You, my transcendental bliss has taken the shape of a great ocean. Being situated in that ocean, I now realize all other so-called happiness to be like the water contained in the hoofprint of a calf.]
Śrīdhara Svāmī, in his Bhāvārtha-dīpikā commentary to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, (SB 10.87.21), writes:
(1.1.40)
tvat-kathāmṛta-pāthodhau
viharanto mahā-mudaḥ
kurvanti kṛtinaḥ kecic
catur-vargaṁ tṛṇopamam
[For those who take pleasure in the transcendental topics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the four progressive realizations of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, all combined together, cannot compare, any more than a straw, to the happiness derived from hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord.]
śrī-kṛṣṇa-karṣiṇī-
Attracting Kṛṣṇa-
(1.1.41)
kṛtvā hariṁ prema-bhājaṁ
priya-varga-samanvitam
bhaktir vaśīkarotīti
śrī-kṛṣṇa-karṣiṇī matā
[Bhakti, devotional service, is known as śrī-kṛṣṇa-karṣiṇī, which means that she fully controls Kṛṣṇa in so many ways, through the influence of love.]
yathāikādeśe (SB 11.14.20)-
As stated in the Eleventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam—
(1.1.42)
na sādhayati māṁ yogo
na sāṅkhyaṁ dharma uddhava
na svādhyāyas tapas tyāgo
yathā bhaktir mamorjitā
[[The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, said:] 'My dear Uddhava, neither through aṣṭāṅga-yoga [the mystic yoga system to control the senses], nor through impersonal monism or an analytical study of the Absolute Truth, nor through study of the Vedas, nor through practice of austerities, nor through charity, nor through acceptance of sannyāsa can one satisfy Me as much as one can by developing unalloyed devotional service unto Me.]
saptame ca nāradoktau (SB 7.10.48)-
And in the Seventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Nārada Muni says-
(1.1.43)
yūyaṁ nṛ-loke bata bhūri-bhāgā
lokaṁ punānā munayo 'bhiyanti
yeṣāṁ gṛhān āvasatīti sākṣād
gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣya-liṅgam
[Nārada Muni continued: My dear Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, all of you [the Pāṇḍavas] are extremely fortunate, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, lives in your palace just like a human being. Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house.]
(1.1.44)
agrato vakṣyamānāyās
tridhā bhakter anukramāt
dviśaḥ ṣaḍbhiḥ padair etan
māhātmyaṁ parikīrtitam
[At the beginning of this book, the greatness of devotional service, bhakti, has been glorified by describing these six uncommon characteristics listed above. Bhakti can be divided into three categories, with each successive category having two more qualities than the previous one.]
kiṁ ca-
Furthermore-
(1.1.45)
svalpāpi rucir eva syād 
bhakti-tattvāvabodhikā
yuktis tu kevalā naiva
yad asyā apratiṣṭhatā
[If a person has even a little taste for understanding devotional service, the revealed scriptures will bring him nearer to the truth of bhakti. But for one who is only interested in speculating and book knowledge and who does not engage in practical service, understanding will never be conclusive.]
tathā prācīnair apy uktam-
In the words of the ancient sages—
(1.1.46)
yatnenāpādito 'py arthaḥ
kuśalair anumātṛbhiḥ
abhiyuktatarair anyair
anyathaivopapādyate
[Whatever meaning has been ascertained with great endeavor by expert logicians, it is found to be inconsistent by those who have even greater erudition.]
iti śrī-bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhau pūrva-vibhāge bhakti-sāmānya-laharī prathamā.

Thus ends the First Wave in the Eastern Section of the Nectar Ocean of Devotional Service, entitled "A General Description of Devotional Service."
(1.2.1)
sā bhaktiḥ sādhana bhāvaḥ
prema ceti tridhoditā
[This process of bhakti-yoga can be divided into three categories-namely devotional service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy and devotional service in pure love of God.]
tatra sādhana-bhaktiḥ-
Devotional service in practice-
(1.2.2)
kṛti-sādhyā bhavet sādhya-
bhāvā sā sādhanābhidhā
nitya-siddhasya bhāvasya
prākaṭyaṁ hṛdi sādhyatā
[When transcendental devotional service by which love for Kṛṣṇa is attained is executed by the senses, it is called sādhana-bhakti, or the regulative discharge of devotional service. Such devotion eternally exists within the heart of every living entity. The awakening of this eternal devotion is the potentiality of devotional service in practice.]
(1.2.3)
sā bhaktiḥ saptama skandhe
bhaṅgyā devarṣiṇoditā
[In the Seventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Nārada Muni has systematically described this process of sādhana-bhakti or devotional service in practice.]
yathā saptame (SB 7.1.32)-
He says as follows:
(1.2.4)
tasmāt kenāpy upāyena
manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet
[Somehow or other we have to attach our minds to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.]
(1.2.5)
vaidhī rāgānugā ceti
sā dvidhā sādhanābhidhā
[This sādhana-bhakti, or practice of devotional service, may be divided into two parts. The first part is called service according to the regulative principles or vaidhi-bhakti. The second part is called rāgānuga or developing attachment by following those who are naturally attracted to Kṛṣṇa.]
tatra vaidhī-
Service according to the regulative principles-
(1.2.6)
yatra rāgān avāptatvāt
pravṛttir upajāyate
śāsanenaiva śāstrasya
sā vaidhī bhaktir ucyate
[When there is no attachment or no spontaneous loving service to the Lord, and one is engaged in the service of the Lord simply out of obedience to the order of the spiritual master or in pursuance of the scriptures, such obligatory service is called vaidhi-bhakti.]
yathā dvitīye (SB 2.1.5)-
As stated in the Second Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhagavatam—
(1.2.7)
tasmād bhārata sarvātmā
bhagavān harir īśvaraḥ
śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca
smartavyaś cecchatābhayam
[O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear about, glorify and also remember the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries.]
As stated in the Padma Purāṇa—
(1.2.8)
smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇur
vismartavyo na jātucit
sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ syur
etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ
[Kṛṣṇa is the origin of Lord Viṣṇu. He should always be remembered and never forgotten at any time. All the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the śāstras should be the servants of these two principles.]
(1.2.9)
ity asau syād vidhir nityaḥ
sarva-varṇāśramādiṣu
nityatve 'py asya nirṇītam
ekādaśy-ādivat phalam
[This prescription is applicable to the entire range of varṇāśrama followers alike-brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas, sannyāsīs, brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras. It has been positively concluded that by steadily following this instruction one may attain results similar to those obtained by observing the ekādaśī-vrata or other such vows.]
ekādaśe tu vyaktam evoktaṁ (SB 11.5.2-3)-
In the Eleventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated-
(1.2.10)
mukha-bāhūru-pādebhyaḥ
puruṣasyāśramaiḥ saha
catvāro jajṣire varṇā
guṇair viprādayaḥ pṛthak
[From the mouth of Brahmā, the brahminical order has come into existence. Similarly, from his arms the kṣatriyas have come, from his waist the vaiśyas have come, and from his legs the śūdras have come. These four orders and their spiritual counterparts [brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa] combine to make human society complete.]
(1.2.11)
ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād-
ātma-prabhavam īśvaram
na bhajanty avajānanti
sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ
[If one simply maintains an official position in the four varṇas and āśramas but does not worship the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, he falls down from his puffed-up position into a hellish condition.]
As stated in the Eleventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (SB 11.27.49)-
(1.2.12)
evaṁ kriyā-yoga-pathaiḥ
pumān vaidika-tāntrikaiḥ
arcann ubhayataḥ siddhiṁ
matto vindaty abhīpsitām
[By worshiping Me through the various methods prescribed in the Vedas and tantras, one will gain from Me his desired perfection in both this life and the next.]
paṣcarātre ca-
In the Nārada Paṣcarātra it is stated-
(1.2.13)
surarṣe vihitā śāstre
harim uddiśya yā kriyā
saiva bhaktir iti proktā
tayā bhaktiḥ parā bhavet iti
[Any activities sanctioned in the revealed scriptures and aiming at the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are accepted by saintly teachers as the regulative principles of devotional service. If one regularly executes such service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, then gradually he rises to the platform of serving in pure love of God.]
tatrādhikarī-
Eligibility of the candidate for accepting devotional service-
(1.2.14)
yaḥ kenāpy ati-bhāgyena
jāta-śraddho 'sya sevane
nāti-sakto na vairāgya-
bhāg asyām adhikāry asau
[One who has become purified by association with great devotees engaged in the service of the Lord, who is not overly attached to material enjoyment nor overly renounced or falsely renounced, such a person is a qualified candidate for devotional service.]
yathaikādaśe (SB 11.20.8)-
As stated in the Eleventh Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam—
(1.2.15)
yadṛcchayā mat-kathādau
jāta-śraddhas tu yaḥ pumān
na nirviṇṇo nātisakto
bhakti-yogo 'sya siddhidaḥ
[Somehow or other, if one is attracted to talks about Me and has faith in the instructions I have set forth in Bhagavad-gītā, and if one is actually detached from material things and material existence, his dormant love for Me will be awakened by devotional service.]
(1.2.16)
uttamo madhyamaś ca syāt
kaniṣṭhaś ceti sa tridhā
[There are three classes of devotees-the first-class devotee  [uttama-bhakta], the second-class devotee or [Cc Madhyama-bhakta], and the neophyte devotee or [kaniṣṭha-bhakta].]
tatrottamaḥ-
About the topmost devotee-
(1.2.17)
śāstre yuktau ca nipuṇaḥ
sarvathā dṛḍha-niścayaḥ
prauḍha-śraddho 'dhikārī yaḥ
sa bhaktāv uttamo mataḥ
[One who is expert in logic and understanding of revealed scriptures, and who always has firm conviction and deep faith that is not blind, is to be considered a topmost devotee in devotional service.]
madhyamaḥ-
About the second-class devotee-
(1.2.18)
yaḥ śāstrādiṣv anipuṇaḥ
śraddhāvān sa tu madhyamaḥ
[He who does not know scriptural argument very well but who has firm faith is called an intermediate or second-class devotee.]
kaniṣṭhaḥ-
About the neophyte devotee-
(1.2.19)
yo bhavet komala-śraddhaḥ
sa kaniṣṭho nigadyate
[One whose faith is not very strong, who is just beginning, should be considered a neophyte devotee.]
(1.2.20)
tatra gītādiṣūktānāṁ
caturṇām adhikāriṇām
madhye yasmin bhagavataḥ
kṛpā syāt tat priyasya vā
[The four classes of persons who surrender unto the Lord and who are mentioned in the Bhagavad-gītā (ārto   jijṣāsur arthārtī jṣānī ca) are also counted as neophyte devotees. Such persons can be elevated to the second- or first-class platform if they can get the association of pure devotees.]
(1.2.21)
sa kṣīṇa-tat-tad-bhāvaḥ syāc 
chuddha-bhakty-adhikāravān
yathebhaḥ śaunakādiś ca
dhruvaḥ sa ca catuḥ-sanaḥ
[When the materialistic motivations of a person have been destroyed, he becomes eligible to perform pure devotional service of the highest order. Examples of these four types of persons, [in the same order as listed in the Gītā], are-the elephant Gajendra, who was seeking relief from distress; Śaunaka Ṛṣi and the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya, who were inquisitive; Mahārāja Dhruva, who was searching after wealth; and the four Kumāras, who were wise men, seeking for knowledge.]
(1.2.22)
bhukti-mukti-spṛhā yāvat
piśācī hṛdi vartate
tāvad bhakti-sukhasyātra
katham abhyudayo bhavet
[The material desire to enjoy the material world and the desire to become liberated from material bondage are considered to be two witches, and they haunt one like ghosts. As long as these witches remain within the heart, how can one feel transcendental bliss? As long as these two witches remain in the heart, there is no possibility of enjoying the transcendental bliss of devotional service.]
(1.2.23)
tatrāpi ca viśeṣeṇa
gatim aṇvīm anicchataḥ
bhaktir hṛta-manaḥ-prāṇān
premṇā tān kurute janān
[Amongst the above-mentioned four types of devotees, the one who does not desire liberation is most excellent. Such persons engage in devotional service (beginning with hearing and chanting) with so much love that their minds and senses become completely absorbed and they become oblivious of material existence.]

Bhuliyā Tomāre & Purport
bhuliyā tomāre, saṁsāre āsiyā,
peye nānā-vidha byathā
tomāra caraṇe, āsiyāchi āmi,
bolibo duḥkhera kathā
[O Lord, having forgotten You and come to this material world, I have experienced a host of sins and sorrows. Now I approach Your lotus feet and submit my tale of woe.]
jananī jaṭhare, chilāma jakhona,
biṣama bandhana-pāśe
eka-bāra prabhu! dekhā diyā more,
vaṣcile e dīna dāse
[While I was bound up tightly in the unbearable confines of my mother’s womb, O Lord, You once revealed Yourself before me. After appearing briefly, You abandoned this poor servant of Yours.]
takhona bhāvinu, janama pāiyā,
koribo bhajana tava
janama hoilo, paḍi' māyā-jāle,
nā hoilo jṣāna-lava
[At that moment I thought, “After my birth this time, I will surely worship You with undivided attention.” But alas, after taking birth I fell into the entangling network of worldly illusions; thus I possessed not even a drop of true knowledge.]
ādarera chele, sva-janera kole,
hāsiyā kāṭānu kāla
janaka jananī-snehete bhuliyā,
saṁsāra lāgilo bhālo
[As a dear son fondled in the laps of attentive relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. The affection of my father and mother helped me forget You still more, and I began to think that the material world was a very nice place.]
krame dina dina, bālaka hoiyā,

dhana uparjana kori
sva-jana pālana, kori eka-mane,
bhulinu tomāre, hari!
[Proud of my accomplished education, I later traveled from place to place and earned much wealth. Thereby maintaining my family with undivided attention, I forgot You, O Lord Hari!]
bārdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda,
kāṇdiyā kātara ati
nā bhajiyā tore, dina bṛthā gelo,
ekhona ki have gati?
[Now in old age, this Bhaktivinoda very sadly weeps as death approaches. I failed to worship You, O Lord, and instead passed my days in vain. What will be my fate now?]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This is a song sung by Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura as the surrendering process. We have heard so much about surrender. So here are some of the songs how one can make surrender. So Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura says that bhuliyā tomāre, saṁsāre āsiyā, “My dear Lord, I have come to this material world by forgetting Lords. And since I have come here, I have suffered so many troubles since long, long time through different species of life. So, therefore, I have come to surrender unto You and submit unto You the story of my sufferings. First thing is that I had to live within the womb of my mother.” 
Jananī jaṭhare, chilāma jakhona. “When I was there, compact, packed up in an airtight bag, hands and legs, I was staying within the womb of my mother. At that time, I had a glimpse of You. After that time, I could not see You. At that time I could see You, a glimpse. At that time I thought,” takhona bhāvinu, janama pāiyā, “I thought that this time when I get out of this womb, I shall surely engage cent per cent in the service of the Lord, worshiping the Lord. No more this repetition of birth and death, is so troublesome. 
Now I shall engage, this birth I shall engage myself simply on devotional service to get out of this māyā. But unfortunately, exactly after my birth,” janama hoilo, paḍi’ māyā-jāle, nā hoilo jṣāna-lava, “as soon as I got out of the womb, immediately māyā, the illusory energy, captured me and I forgot that I was in such precarious condition, and I was crying and praying to the Lord that this time I shall get out and engage myself in devotional service. But all these senses were lost as soon as I took my birth.” Then the next stage is ādarera chele, sva-janera kole. “Then I become a very pet child and everyone is taking me on the lap, and I thought, ’Life is very nice, everyone loves me.’ Then I thought, ’This material life is very good.’” 
Ādarera chele, sva-janera kole, hāsiyā kāṭānu kāla. “Because there is no trouble. As soon as I am in little difficulty, everyone comes forward to give me relief. So I thought my life will go on like this. So I simply wasted my time simply by smiling, and that smiling became attractive to my relatives and they patted me. I thought, ’This is the life.’” Janaki...janaka jananī-snehete bhuliyā, saṁsāra lāgilo. “At that time, a great deal of affection of parents. So I thought material life is very nice.” 
Krame dina dina, bālaka hoiyā, khelinu bālaka-saha. “Then gradually I grew up and I began to play with my childhood friends, and it was very nice life. And after some days, when I was little intelligent, then I was put into school. So I began to study very seriously. Then after that,” vidyāra gaurave, bhrami’ deśe deśe, dhana uparjana kori. “Then being puffed up...” Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura was magistrate. So he was transferred from one place to another. He is stating his life, that vidyāra gaurave, “Because I was little educated, so I was posted and I was earning decently. So I was thinking, ’It is very nice.’” 
Vidyāra gaurave, bhrami’ deśe deśe, dhana uparjana kori. Swa-jana pālana, kori eka-mane, “And only duty was how to maintain, how to raise family members, how to keep them happy. That became my only aims and object of life.” Bārdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda. Now Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura, in his old age, kāṇdiyā kātara ati, “Now I am seeing that I will have to give up all this arrangement, I will have to go away and take another body. Therefore, I do not know what kind of body I am going to get. Therefore, I am crying, I am very much aggrieved.” 
Bārdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda, kāṇdiyā kātara ati, “I am very much aggrieved.” Nā bhajiyā tore, dina bṛthā gelo, ekhona ki. “So without worshiping You, without serving You, I have simply wasted my time in this way. I do not know what to do. Therefore, I surrender.”

Duṣṭā Mana
(1)
duṣṭa mana! tumi kiser vaiṣṇava?
pratiṣṭhār tare, nirjaner ghare,
tava 'hari-nāma' kevala 'kaitava'
[O wicked mind! What kind of Vaiṣṇava do you think you are? Your pretentious show of chanting Lord Hari's holy name in a solitary place is only for the sake of attaining the false prestige of a worldly reputation—it is nothing but pure hypocrisy.]
(2)
jaḍer pratiṣṭhā, śukarer viṣṭhā,
jāno nā ki tāhā 'māyār vaibhava'
kanaka kāminī, divasa-yāminī,
bhāviyā ki kāja, anitya se saba
[Such materialistic prestige is as disgusting as the stool of a hog. Do you not know that it is only a mere illusion cast by the potency of Māyā? What is the value of contemplating day and night your plans for enjoying wealth and women? All these things are only temporary.]
(3)
tomār kanaka, bhoger janaka,
kanaker dvāre sevaho 'mādhava'
kāminīr kāma, nahe tava dhāma,
tāhār-mālika kevala 'yādava'
[When you claim wealth as your own, it creates in you ever-increasing desires for material enjoyment. Your riches should be used for serving Mādhava, the Lord of all wealth. Neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust for women, whose only true proprietor is Lord Yādava.]
(4)
pratiṣṭhāśā-taru, jaḍa-māyā-maru,
nā pela 'rāvaṇa' yujhiyā 'rāghava'
vaiṣṇavī pratiṣṭhā, tāte koro niṣṭhā,
tāhā nā bhajile labhibe raurava
[The demon Rāvaṇa (lust-incarnate) fought with Lord Rāmachandra (love-incarnate) in order to gain the tree of worldly reputation-but that oasis turned out to be but a mirage cast in the desert wasteland of the Lord's illusory material potency. Please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and solid platform whereupon a Vaiṣṇava ever stands. If you neglect worshiping the Lord from this position, then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence.]
(5)
harijana-dveṣa, pratisthāśā-kleśa,
koro keno tabe tāhār gaurava
vaiṣṇaver pāche, pratisthāśā āche,
tā'te kabhu nāhe 'anitya-vaibhava'
[Why do you needlessly suffer the torment of blaspheming the devotees of Lord Hari, attempting to achieve their eminence, thereby only proving your own fruitless foolishness? The desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one becomes a devotee of the Lord, for eternal fame automatically follows the heels of a Vaiṣṇava. And that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly opulence.]

Gaura Pahū & Purport
(1)
gaurā pahu nā bhajiyā goinu
prema-ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu
[O Lord Gaura! I have never engaged myself in Your worship. Thus I am robbed of the jewel of divine love by my own negligence.]
(2)
adhane ylsvatana kari dhana teyāginu
āpana karama-doṣe āpani ḍubinu
[Although being quite in need of wealth, I have still worked very hard to reject the great opportunity of receiving Your riches. Then I submerged myself in the ocean of sinful reactions.]
(3)
sat-saṅga chāḍi' kainu asate vilāsa
te-kāraṇe lāgilo ye karma-bandha-phāṅsa
[Avoiding the association of saintly persons, I sported merrily in the company of materialistic rascals. For that reason I have become strung up in the noose of my own fruitive activities.]
(4)
viṣaya-viṣama-viṣa satata khāinu
gaura-kīrtana-rase magana nā hainu
[I perpetually drank the horrible poison of mundane sense gratification, having never absorbed myself in the divine mellows of the kīrtan glorifying Lord Gaura.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Gaura pahū nā bhajiyā goinu, prema-rathana-dhana helāya hārāiṅu. This is another song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He's saying that "I have invited my spiritual death by not worshiping Lord Caitanya." Gaura pahū nā bhajiyā goinu. Gaura pahū means "Lord Caitanya," and nā bhajiyā, "without worshiping." Goinu, "I have invited spiritual death." And adhame yatane kari dhanu tainu. "Why I have invited the spiritual death? Because I am engaged in something which is useless and I have rejected the real purpose of my life."
Adhama means valueless things. And dhana means valuables. So actually, everyone of us, neglecting our spiritual emancipation, we are engaged in material sense gratification, and therefore we are losing the opportunity of this human form of body to elevate myself on the spiritual platform. This human body is especially given to the conditioned soul to take a chance for spiritual emancipation. So anyone who does not care for spiritual emancipation, he is inviting spiritual death. Spiritual death means to forget oneself, that he's spirit. That is spiritual death. 
So in the animal life it is fully forgetfulness. They cannot be reminded at any circumstances that they are not this body, they are different from this body. It is only in this human form of body, human form of life, one can understand that he is not this body, he's spirit soul. So by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, one can easily understand this fact, and by worshiping Lord Caitanya, following His principles and ways, one can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and very easily come to the platform of spiritual understanding. But Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says on our behalf that we are neglecting this. Therefore we are inviting spiritual death.
Then he says that prema-rathana-dhana helāya hārāiṅu. Spiritual life means to develop real love. Everyone says love. There are so many signboards, so many papers, "love, love." But there is no love. This is illusion. It is all lust. Love for intoxication, love for sex, love for this... This is going on. So actual love means... Love, this word, can be applicable only with Kṛṣṇa, with God. Because we are created for that purpose. To love means to love Kṛṣṇa. So that is wanted. That is spiritual love. 
So prema-rathana. I could achieve that transcendental position of love, but I am neglecting. Therefore I am calling my spiritual death. And these things are happening due to my past misdeeds. Due to my past deeds, misdeeds, I have got a type of body. Everyone who has got this material body, it is due to past misdeeds. Sometimes we call pious deeds. Actually, so long one gets this material body there is no pious deeds. Pious deeds means no more material body. That is pious deeds. Otherwise it is to be taken as a fact that even Brahmā, who is the chief living entity within this universe and has got a mass of years as duration of life, all power, still, that is also considered as misdeeds. Because he has got the material body.
So we are going deep down and down, one after another, body, by our misdeeds. In the Bhāgavata also it is stated that they do not know that by this sense gratificatory process they will have another body. And the body is the cause of material pangs. Because I have got this body, therefore I feel headache, I feel stomachache. I feel this and that. But, as soon as we are out of this material body, there is no more material pangs. It is simply joyful life. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg 18.54]. 
[One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.]
Prasannātmā means joyful. As soon as one gets spiritual life. So due to my past deeds, I am missing this opportunity. Apana kara mada seva...
And why it is happening? Sat-saṅga chāḍi khainu asatyera vilāsa. "I have given up the association of devotees, but I am associating with common nonsense men." Asatyera. Asat and sat. Sat means spirit. And asat means matter. So association of material attachment means implication in this material conditional life. So one has to make association with devotees. Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido. One can understand about God only in association of devotees. 
Therefore we are advocating this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, society. Actually, you'll find, one who comes to this society, by associating a few days, a few weeks, he becomes conscious and he comes forward for initiation and further advancement. So this association is very important. And those who are conducting different centers and temples, they should be very responsible men. Because everything will depend on their sincere activities and character. If they are insincere, then that will not be effective. One may come and associate with us, but if we are insincere, then it will be not be effective. But if the devotees are sincere, anyone who will come in contact with a devotee, he'll change. That is the secret.
Sat-saṅga chāḍi asatyera vilāsa. And as soon as we give up the association of these devotees, immediately māyā will catch me. Immediately. Māyā is just side by side. As soon as we give up this company, māyā says "Yes, come in my company." Without any company, nobody can remain neutral. That is not possible. He must associate with māyā or Kṛṣṇa. So everyone should be very much serious to keep association with devotees, with Kṛṣṇa.
When we speak of Kṛṣṇa, "Kṛṣṇa" means Kṛṣṇa with His devotees. Kṛṣṇa is never alone. Kṛṣṇa is with Rādhārāṇī. Rādhārāṇī is with the gopīs. And Kṛṣṇa is with the cowherd boys. We are not impersonalists. We do not see Kṛṣṇa alone. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa means with Kṛṣṇa's devotees. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to keep association with the devotees of Kṛṣṇa. 
Viṣaya viṣama viṣa satata khāinu. And he says that "I have drunk always the most dangerous poison of sense gratification." Viṣaya viṣama viṣa. Viṣaya means sense gratification. Eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. These are called... These four principles are called viṣaya. And viṣama means dangerously. And viṣa means poison. If one is simply engaged with these four principles of life, just like animals then it is to be supposed that he's simply drinking poison. That's all. 
Viṣaya viṣama satata khāinu. "I know this be poison, but I am so much intoxicated that I am drinking this poison every moment." Gaura-kīrtana-rase magana nā painu. "And I could not merge myself into the saṅkīrtana movement started by Lord Caitanya." Oh, that is actually the fact. Those who are too much attached to materialistic way of life, or always drinking the poison of sense gratification, they are not attracted by the saṅkīrtana movement.
So at the last, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is lamenting. He's representing ourself. If one comes to that point of lamentation, that is also very nice. He immediately becomes purified. Lamentation means purification. So he says, keno vā āchaya prāṇa kichu bali... "Why I am living? I do not make association with the devotees. I do not take part in the saṅkīrtana movement. I do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa. I do not understand what is Lord Caitanya. Then what for I am living?" 
This is lamentation. "What is my happiness? What is the standard of my happiness? Why I am living?" Narottama dāsa kena nā gela. "Why I did not die long, long ago? I should have died. What is the meaning of my living?" So it is not Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's lamentation. Everyone of us should think like that, that "If we cannot make association with devotees, if we do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, if we do not come in touch with Lord Caitanya and associates, it was better for me to die. And there is no other remedy."

This song was sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a great devotee-ācārya in the disciplic succession of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya. Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya means the disciplic succession who are coming down from Lord Caitanya. So this Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has written many songs, and it is recognized as authority by all the Vaiṣṇavas. He has sung the songs in simple Bengali language, but the purport and the deep meaning of the song is very significant. 
He says: gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka-śarīra. This is the perfection of chanting, that as soon as we chant or take the name of Lord Gaurāṅga, who initiated the Saṅkīrtana Movement, at once there will be a shivering in the body. So it is not to be imitated. But Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is recommending when that opportune moment will come to us, that as soon as we shall chant Lord Gaurāṅga’s name, there will shivering in the body. And, after the shivering, hari hari bolite nayane ba’be nīr, by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa there will be tears in the eyes. Then again he says, āra kabe nitāicand koruṇā karibe. We are all asking about the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. 
Nityānanda is supposed to be the original spiritual master. So we have to approach Gaurāṅga, or Lord Caitanya, through the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. So what is the symptom of a person who has achieved the causeless mercy of Lord Nityānanda? Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that one who has actually received the causeless mercy of Nityānanda, he has no more any material desire. That is the symptom. Āra kabe nitāicand koruṇā karibe saṁsāra-vāsanā mora kabe tuccha. Saṁsāra-vāsanā means desire for material enjoyment, when it will become very insignificant. Of course, so long we have got this body we have to accept so many things, material. But not in the spirit of enjoyment, but to keep up the body and soul together. 
So... and he says further: rūpa-raguṇatha-pade haibe ākuti. When I shall be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvāmīs. Ākuti means eagerness. Because Rūpa Gosvāmī is the father of this devotional service. He has written that book, Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu. In that book there is nice direction. Of course, in Caitanya-caritāmṛta and other books, we have given the summary of those direction in our book, Teachings of Lord Caitanya. 
So one has to learn the conjugal loving affairs of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the teachings of these Six Gosvāmīs. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura giving us the direction that you do not try to understand the conjugal love of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa by your own endeavor. You should try to understand by the direction of the Gosvāmīs. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings; 
rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti
kabe hāma bujhaba śrī yugala-pīriti
[Prārthanā 1.3–4]
[When shall I be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvāmīs, headed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Śrīla Raghunātha Dāsa Gosvāmī? By their instructions I shall be able to properly understand the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.]
Yugala-pīriti means conjugal love. And another he sings that viṣaya chāṛiyā kabe śuddha ha’be mana. This mind, so long the mind is too much absorbed in materialistic thought, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Vṛndāvana. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says: viṣaya chāṛiyā kabe śuddha ha’be mana. 
When my mind will be completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires. Then I shall be able to understand what is Vṛndāvana, what is conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and then my spiritual life will be successful.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This is a song sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He says, “When that day will come, that I shall sing simply Lord Caitanya’s name and there will be shivering on my body?” Gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka-śarīra. Pulaka-śarīra means shivering on the body. When one is factually situated in the transcendental platform, sometimes there are eight kinds of symptoms: crying, talking like a madman, and shivering of the body, dancing without any care for any other men... 
These symptoms develop automatically. They are not practiced artificially. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is aspiring for that day, not that one has to artificially imitate. That he does not recommend. He says, “When that day will come, so that simply by uttering the name of Lord Caitanya there will be a shivering on my body?” Gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka-śarīra and hari hari bolite: “And as soon as I shall chant ’Hari Hari,’ or ’Hare Kṛṣṇa,’ there will be pouring down of tears from my eyes.” 
Hari hari bolite nayane ba’be nīra. Nīra means water. Similarly, Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said that “When that day will come?” We should simply aspire. But if, by Kṛṣṇa’s grace, that stage we can reach, these symptoms will come automatically. But Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that it is not possible to reach that stage without being freed from material affection.
Therefore he says, āra kabe nitāi-cander, koruṇā koribe: “When that day will come when Lord Nityānanda’s mercy will be bestowed upon me so that...’’ Viṣaya chāriyā. Āra kabe nitāi-cander koruṇā koribe, saṁsāra-bāsanā mora kabe tuccha ha’be. Saṁsāra-bāsanā means the desire for material enjoyment. Saṁsāra-bāsanā mora kabe tuccha ha’be: “When my desire for material enjoyment will be insignificant, nonimportant.’’ Tuccha. 
Tuccha means a thing which we calculate no value: “Throw it away.’’ Similarly, spiritual advancement is possible when one is convinced that “This material world and material happiness is no value. It cannot give me any real bliss of life.’’ This conviction is very much necessary. Saṁsāra-bāsanā mora kabe tuccha ha’be. And he also says that “When I shall be free from the desires of material enjoyment, then it will be possible to see the real nature of Vṛndāvana.’’ 
Viṣaya chāriyā kabe śuddha ha’be mana: “When my mind will be completely purified, uncontaminated from the material contamination, at that time it will be possible for me to see what is Vṛndāvana.’’ In other words, one cannot go to Vṛndāvana by force and live there, and he will achieve that transcendental bliss. No. One has to make his mind freed from all material desires. Then one can live at Vṛndāvana and relish its residential benefit. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that viṣaya chāriyā kabe, śuddha ha’be mana: “When my mind will be freed from the contamination of this material enjoyment and I shall be purified, then it will be possible for me to see Vṛndāvana as it is.’’ Otherwise it is not possible.
And he says again that to go to Vṛndāvana means to understand the transcendental pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. How this will be possible? So he says, rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti. Rūpa, Rūpa Gosvāmī, beginning from Rūpa Gosvāmī down to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, there were Six Gosvāmīs: Rūpa, Sanātana, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Jīva Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. So he says, rūpa-raghunātha-pade: “Beginning from Rūpa Gosvāmī down to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī,” pade, “at their lotus feet. When I shall be eager to be attached at their lotus feet?” 
Rūpa-raghunātha-pade, hoibe ākuti. Ākuti, eagerness. What is that eagerness? That means to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the guidance of the Gosvāmīs. One should not try to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa by his own effort. That will not help him. As these Gosvāmīs, they have given us direction, just like Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, so one has to follow step after step how to make progress. Then there will be a fortunate day when we shall be able to understand what is the pastimes or loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, if we take it as ordinary boy and girl reciprocating their loving feelings, then we will misunderstand. Then there will be the production of prakṛta-sahajiyā, victims of Vṛndāvana.
So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is giving us the direction, how one can reach the highest perfectional stage of associating with Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. The first thing is that one should be very much attached to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That will lead us. Because He came to deliver the understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, therefore one should first of all surrender to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By surrendering to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu will be pleased. And by His pleasing, we shall be freed from material desires. And when material desires are no more, then we shall be able to enter Vṛndāvana. And after entering Vṛndāvana, when we are eager to serve the Six Gosvāmīs, then we can reach the platform to understand the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This nice song was sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, one of the great ācāryas of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava sampradāya. That is the sect of Vaiṣṇavism started by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. "Gauḍīya" means belonging to Bengal. There are five Gauḍa-deśa in the northern part of India, out of which part of Bengal, West Bengal, is called Gauḍa-deśa. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's songs are very appropriate just to the conclusion of Vedic injunctions. So he sings this song, how one can rise up to the transcendental plane for associating directly with Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, what is that process. 
The process is one should begin this Kṛṣṇa consciousness under the mercy of Lord Caitanya. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and He is teaching people how to become Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Lord Kṛṣṇa, He [break] personally spoke about Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā, but people who are not very intelligent, who are described in the Bhagavad-gītā as mūḍha—mūḍha means rascal—and duṣkṛtina, and miscreant; and narādhama—
[break] narādhama means lowest of the mankind—such persons cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. But still, Kṛṣṇa was so merciful that in order to claim all these people, means the lowest of mankind, miscreant, and fools and rascals, rejected, so He came in the form of Lord Caitanya to reclaim them. 
So God is so merciful that even some persons cannot understand Him... First thing is people cannot understand actually what is God, but God comes Himself to explain Himself. Still, they commit mistake. Therefore Kṛṣṇa comes as a devotee to teach us about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we have to follow the footprints of Lord Caitanya. 
And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura teaches that "First of all, try to chant the name of Gaurasundara." 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda
 śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda
[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
In this way, when we are a little bit attached with Gaurasundara, Lord Caitanya, then we automatically feel transcendental emotion. And that emotional stage is exhibited by shivering in the body. We should not, however, imitate such shivering to show to the public that "I have become a great devotee," but we should execute devotional service nicely and faithfully; then that stage will come automatically, shivering. 
As soon as one will chant the name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, there will be shivering. This is the first symptom that one is getting advanced in the perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka śarīre. He's expecting. Although he was a great ācārya, still, he was expecting, "When that stage will come?'' 
The wording of the song is as follows. G-a-u-r-a-n-g-a, gaurāṅga. Bolite, b-a-l-i-t-e. Habe, h-a-b-e. Gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka, p-u-l-a-k-a. Pulaka śarīra, s-a-r-i-r. Gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka śarīra hari hari, h-a-r-i h-a-r-i. Bolite, b-a-l-i-t-e. Hari hari bolite habe, h-a-b-e. Hari hari bolite kabe....  Not habe; kabe, k-a-b-e. Nayane, n-a-y-a-n-e. Ba'be, b-a-b-e. Nīra, n-e-e-r. The meaning 
[break] that there will be not only shivering as soon as I utter the name of Gaurāṅga, but there will be torrents of tears in my eyes as soon as I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the explanation.
The next line is āra kabe nitāi-cānder koruṇā koribe. [spells out] Āra kabe nitāi-cānder koruṇā koribe. This is also aspiration, that "When Nityānanda Prabhu, the constant associate of Lord Caitanya, will be pleased upon me?" Koruṇā koribe. Koruṇā koribe means "He will be pleased upon me." 
Nityānanda Prabhu, or Nitāicānd, is the original spiritual master. He is Baladeva. Bala means strength, and deva, the Personality of Godhead who gives strength. Therefore Nitāicānd is the symbol of spiritual master who gives strength to the disciples. This is the process of disciplic succession. 
We have to acquire the spiritual strength. No amount of material strength can help me in advancement of spiritual life. We must derive the spiritual strength. Just like we have to take electricity from the powerhouse by directly connecting with the powerhouse—not the wiring, but the electricity—similarly, this disciplic succession means the strength is descending from the original person through the spiritual master. That is the idea. 
So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura explains that "When Nitāicānd will be pleased?" And the result of such pleasure of Nitāicānd is that one becomes free from all desires for material enjoyment.
āra kabe nitāi-cānd koruṇā karibe
saṁsāra-bāsanā mora kabe tuccha ha'be
[spells out] So by the mercy of Nitāicānd, one will get free from all desires of material enjoyment.
The next line is viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana. [spells out] This kabe means "when," aspiring. Śuddha means "purified." Ha'be, "will be." Mana means "mind." So when actually our spiritual master or Nityānanda Prabhu is pleased upon us, at that time the symptom will be that we shall no longer hanker after material enjoyment. 
When that stage of life is arrived, at that time only, we can understand what is Vṛndāvana, the abode of Kṛṣṇa. Vṛndāvana is not a material place, just like ordinary city or country. It is transcendental. So appreciation of Vṛndāvana will be possible when our mind is free from all material desires, viṣaya chāḍiyā. 
Viṣaya means eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are called viṣaya. Viṣaya means "objects." In the material world there are these four objects are in view: how I shall eat, how I shall sleep, how I shall mate, how I shall defend. So as soon as one is purified of all material desires, these material objectives will not be a problem.
viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana
kabe hāma herabo śrī-vṛndāvana
So then we shall be able to understand what is Vṛndāvana and what is kingdom of God, or Goloka Vṛndāvana.
And the next stage is that one has to understand what is the loving affairs, conjugal love, between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. And that will be possible if we carefully study the literatures left by the Gosvāmīs. Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī has left behind him Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, Vidagdha-mādhava, Lalitā-mādhava. Many books, especially that Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.
So,
viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana
kabe hāma herabo śrī-vṛndāvana
rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti...
[When will my mind become free from all material desires and anxieties? Only in that purified state will I be able to understand Vṛndāvana and the conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Then my spiritual life will be successful.]
[spells out] Habe means "will be." Ākuti, "eagerness." "When I shall be very much eager to understand what is spoken by the Gosvāmīs?'' These are the processes. We have to derive the pleasure of Nityānanda. We have to understand the six Gosvāmīs, what they are speaking. We have to cleanse our mind from material desires. These are the qualifications to understand what is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, we shall be misled; we shall think Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa ordinary boy and girl. No. 
The activities are just like that, but it is all spiritual. There is no material contamination at all. There is no material inebrieties. Therefore, in such loving affairs, in such embracing, such kissing in Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, that is all spiritual, eternal, blissful, full of knowledge, full of pleasure.
So at the present moment, in material condition, it is not possible to understand, but this is the purificatory process. We have to chant, 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda

This chanting process has got the spiritual value to lead us to the highest stage of understanding Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as we are capable of understanding what is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, then it is possible for getting admission in the spiritual world. 
So all people interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should follow the regulative principles, gradually reach the highest successful transcendental platform of understanding Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. [end]

This mahā-mantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, is being chanted by Brahmā with his four mouths. Brahmā-jape catur-mukhe. Brahmā means Lord Brahmā, and jape means he is chanting, catur-mukhe, with his four heads. Within this universe, only Brahmā has got four heads. And Lord Śiva sometimes exhibits five heads. 
So it is explained here that Lord Brahmā is also chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, with his four mouths, still he is chanting. He does not think that he is satiated. This transcendental name is so sweet that either you chant with your one mouth and one tongue or with one thousand mouth or one thousand tongue, still, you will never feel tired. That is the purport of this song. 
Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, he lamented that “This Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, these names are so sweet that how I can relish the transcendental sweetness with one tongue and one mouth? If God would have given me millions of tongues and millions of mouths, then I would have relished little of it.” So he lamented. 
Here also it is said that Nārada Muni, he has got always with him a tambura, and he is traveling all over the universe constantly. He cannot stay in any place more than a few seconds, and he has no companion. But his only companion is that tambura and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is said here, nārada-yabe, vīṇā-yantre, kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare. So all the devotees of the Lord, they are chanting in their own way, still they never feel tired or satiated. That is the significance of transcendental chanting... [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This transcendental vibration—by chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare—is the sublime method for reviving our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As living spiritual souls we are all originally Kṛṣṇa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter since time immemorial, our consciousness is now polluted by material atmosphere. In this polluted concept of live, we are all trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in our complexities. This illusion is called māyā, or hard struggle for existence for winning over the stringent laws of material nature. This illusory struggle against the material nature can at once be stopped by revival of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original energy of the living entity. When we hear the transcendental vibration, this consciousness is revived. And the process is recommended by authorities for this age. By practical experience also, we can perceive that by chanting this mahā-mantra, or the Great Chanting for Deliverance, one can at once feel transcendental ecstasy from the spiritual stratum. When one is factually on the plane of spiritual understanding, surpassing the stages of sense, mind and intelligence, one is situated on the transcendental plane. 
This chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is directly enacted from the spiritual platform, surpassing all lower states of consciousness—namely sensual, mental and intellectual. There is no need of understanding the language of the mantra, nor is there any need of mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this mahā-mantra. It springs automatically from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in this transcendental sound vibration, without any previous qualification, and dance in ecstasy.
We have seen it practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting, or even a dog can take part in it. The chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate effect can be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips of nondevotee should be avoided, as much as milk touched by the lips of a serpent causes poisonous effect.
The word Harā is a form of addressing the energy of the Lord. Both Kṛṣṇa and Rāma are forms of addressing directly the Lord, and they mean "the highest pleasure, eternal." Harā is the supreme pleasure potency of the Lord. This potency, when addressed as Hare, helps us in reaching the Supreme Lord.
The material energy, called as mayā, is also one of the multipotencies of the Lord, as much as we are also marginal potency of the Lord. The living entities are described as superior energy than matter. When the superior energy is in contact with inferior energy, it becomes an incompatible situation. But when the supreme marginal potency is in contact with the spiritual potency, Harā, it becomes the happy, normal condition of living entity.
The three words, namely Harā, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, are transcendental seeds of the mahā-mantra, and the chanting is spiritual call for the Lord and His internal energy, Harā, for giving protection to the conditioned soul. The chanting is exactly like genuine cry by the child for mother. Mother Harā helps in achieving the grace of the supreme father, Hari or Kṛṣṇa, and the Lord reveals Himself to such sincere devotee.
No other means, therefore, of spiritual realization is as effective in this age, as chanting the mahā-mantra,

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, His incarnation Śrī Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Śrī Gadādhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Śrīvāsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are complete when we say, 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda 
śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
As preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting this Paṣca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Paṣca-tattva mantra, namely, 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda 
śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahā-mantra (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare), we must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Paṣca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. That will be very effective.

Iṣṭa Deve Vijñapti & Purport 1
Prabhupāda: [sings Hari hari biphale, accompanied by harmonium] 
hari hari! bifale janama goṅāinu
manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu
[O Lord Hari, I have wasted my life. Although I have taken this rare human birth, I have not served Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and thus I have knowingly drunk poison.]
golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana,
rati nā janmilo kene tāy
saṁsāra-biṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jwale,
jurāite nā koinu upāy
[The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vṛndāvana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari’s holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns in the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not accepted the means for relieving it.]
brajendra-nandana jei, śacī-suta hoilo sei,
balarāma hoilo nitāi
dīna-hīna jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo,
tāra śākṣī jagāi mādhāi
[Lord Kṛṣṇa, the son of the King of Vraja, became the son of Śacī, and Balarāma became Nitāi. The holy name delivered all those souls who were lowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagāi and Mādhāi are evidence of this.]
hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-sutā-juta,
koruṇā karoho ei-bāro
narottama-dāsa koy, nā ṭheliho rāṅgā pāy,

[O Lord Kṛṣṇa, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, please be merciful to me now. Narottama Dāsa says, “O Lord, please do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?]
[break]
[11:48]
[Laughter]
Govinda dāsī: That's what I did. I finally couldn't catch up with you. [break]
Pradyumna: Hari hari biphale, janama...
Prabhupāda: Goṅāinu. G-o-y-a-i-n-u. 
[note: Bengali phonetic spelling sometimes does not match the BBT standard diacritics used for Bengali. Ed. note]
Pradyumna: Gowanu.
Prabhupāda: Goṅāinu.
Pradyumna: Goṅāinu.
Prabhupāda: Biphale, janama goṅāinu. Hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu. Goṅāinu.
Pradyumna: Goṅāinu. Goṅāinu?
Prabhupāda: Yes. So shall I give the meaning also?
Pradyumna: Afterwards, I guess. Oh, this is the first verse? Hari hari biphale, janama goṅāinu.
Prabhupāda: Janama goṅāinu. This is first line. Hari hari biphale, janama goṅāinu. The next line: manuṣya-janama pāiyā. M-a-n-u-s-y-a.
Pradyumna: Manuṣya...
Prabhupāda: Janama. J-a-n-a-m-a. Pāiyā, p-a-i-y-a.
Pradyumna: Pāiyā. 
[break]  
[No audio] 
Prabhupāda: Manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā. Next line. R-a-d-h-a, Rādhā, Kṛṣṇa, K-r-i-s-h-n-a, nā bhajiyā, n-a, nā, bhajiyā, b-h-a-j-i-a, nā bhajiyā. Next line, jāniyā, j-a-n-i-a, jāniyā.
Pradyumna: J-a?
Prabhupāda: N-i-a. Śuniyā, s-u-n-i-a. Jāniyā śuniyā biṣa, b-i-s-a, biṣa.
Pradyumna: Biṣa?
Prabhupāda: B-i-s-a. Khāinu, k-h-a-i-n-u.
hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu
manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu
The meaning is, Hari Hari, "My Lord,'' biphale, "uselessly,'' janama, "life,'' goṅāinu, "spent up. I have uselessly spent up my life.'' Why? Because manuṣya-janama pāiyā, "I got this human form of life,'' manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, "but I did not engage myself in the loving transcendental service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.'' 
Rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu: "Willingly, purposefully, I have drunk poison.'' Hari hari biphale, janama goṅāinu.
Pradyumna: Tell it for each word. Jāniyā means?
Prabhupāda: Jāniyā means knowingly, and śuniyā means hearing.
Pradyumna: Hearing?
Prabhupāda: Yes. Two kinds of knowledge are there. You can practically understand by experiment—this is called jāniyā. And another knowledge is by hearing from authoritative source. That is also knowledge. 
Jāniyā śuniyā "By hearing process and by experimental knowledge, in both ways, I know that this human form of life is meant for engaging in the loving service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, but I did not do that. That means purposefully I have drunk poison. I have committed suicide.'' 
Then golokera prema-dhana, g-o-l-e... No. G-o-l-o-k-e-r-a, golokera. Prema, p-r-e-m-a, prema. Dhana, d-h-a-n-a. Golokera prema-dhana. That means: "This chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa, is imported from the transcendental abode of Goloka." Hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana. "This chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇ, Hare Hare, this is not material vibration. 
This sound is..." What is called? Captured? Just like we capture sound. The sound is in the air. So this sound... There are different layers of air, but this sound is in the highest layer, in the transcendental, spiritual layer, beyond this material world. From that sound it is captured. It requires strong machine to capture that sound. Golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.
Pradyumna: Hari-nāma-saṅ...
Prabhupāda: H-a-r-i-n-a-m-a, hari-nāma, saṅkīrtana, s-a-n-k-i-r-t-a-n-a. Hari-nāma saṅkīrtana. Rati nā janmila. R-a-t-i, n-a, nā, janmila, j-a-n-m-i-l-a. Rati nā janmila kena, k-e-n-a, tāi, t-a-i. 
"It is so sublime, transcendental, and it is imported from the transcendental world, Goloka Vṛndāvana. Unfortunately, I do not know why I did not get any attachment for such nice thing." Rati nā janmila kene tāi. Tāi means "in that." Biṣaya biṣānale. B-i-s-a-y-a, biṣaya. Biṣa, b-i-s-a, biṣa, nale, n-a-l-e.
Pradyumna: Biṣa?
Prabhupāda: Biṣa, b-i-s-a, nale, n-a-l-e. Biṣānale. The blazing fire of poison. The material enjoyment is blazing fire of poison. "Just like a person, if he is put into the blazing fire, he is burned into ashes, similarly, simply by thinking, 'How I shall enjoy this? How I shall enjoy this materially?' this is just like blazing fire of poison. So I am suffering always." 
Biṣaya biṣānale dibā-niśi hiyā jvale. Dibā-niśi, d-i-b-a, dibā-niśi. Dibā means day, and niśi, niśi means night. So "Day and night I am in this blazing fire."
Pradyumna: Neśi? How do you spell that?
Prabhupāda: Niśi, n-i-s-i.
Pradyumna: Dibā n-i-s-i, dibā-niśi.
Prabhupāda: Hiyā, h-i-a, hiyā, jvale, j-a..., j-v-a-l-e.
Pradyumna: J-v-e-l-e.
Prabhupāda: J-v-a-l-e. Dibā-niśi hiyā jvale: "The heart is burning always, day and night." Tarivare. T-a-r-i v-a-r-e, tarivare. Tarivare means "to get out of it."
Pradyumna: Can you spell that again?
Prabhupāda: Tarivare? T-a-r-i v-a-r-e.
Pradyumna: Vire?
Prabhupāda: R-e, tarivare.
Pradyumna: Tarivare.
Prabhupāda: Nā kainu. N-a, nā, kainu, k-a-i-n-u, nā kainu, upāya, u-p-a-y-a, upāya. Tarivare means "to get out of it,'' nā kainu, "did not do.'' Nā means "not,'' kainu, "did not do.'' Nā kainu upāya. Upāya means "means.'' That means "If anyone wants to get out of this blazing fire of poison of material enjoyment, then he has to take to this hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana, this chanting. 
That is the only method. So I did not do that. I engaged myself in this viṣaya viṣānale, this material enjoyment. Therefore my life has been uselessly spoiled. Tarivare nā kainu upāya. The next line, vrajendra-nandana yei. V-r-a-j-e-n-d-r-a, vrajendra, nandana, n-a-n-d-a-n-a, yei, y-a-i.
Pradyumna: Jia.
Prabhupāda: Jai. Vrajendranandana yei, śacī-suta, s-a-c-h-i-s-u-t-a, śacī-suta, haila, h-a-i-l-a, haila, sei, s-a-i, sei. Vrajendra-nandana yei, śacī-suta haila sei, balarāma haila nitāi. B-a-l-a-r-a-m-a, balarāma, haila, h-i, h-a-i-l-a. Haila, h-a-i-l-a, nitāi, n-i-t-a-i, haila nitāi. Balarāma haila nitāi. And this means... 
Vrajendra-nandana yei: "The Supreme Personality who appeared as the son of King Nanda, the same Supreme Personality Kṛṣṇa has now appeared as the son of Mother Śacī." And Balarāma, b-a-l-a-r-a-m-a; haila, haila means "has become"; Nitāi, "Lord Nityānanda." "Formerly the Personality of Godhead who was... 
[Audio resumes]
...known as Balarāma has now become Lord Nityānanda." So what is their business? Pāpī tāpī yata chilo. P-a-p-i, t-a-p-i, pāpī tāpī, yata, y-a-t-a, yata chilo, c-h-h-i-l-a.
Pradyumna: C-h-h-i-l-a?
Prabhupāda: Yes. Pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme, uddhārilo. H-a-r-i, hari, nāme, n-a-m-e, nāme, uddhārilo, u-d-d-h-a-r-i-l-a. That means, "These two Personality of Godhead, They, simply by distributing the transcendental chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa, has reclaimed all conditioned and sinful souls." Pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo. 
"And the concrete example for this activity is Jagāi and Mādhāi, the two brothers known by Jagāi-Mādhāi.'' J-a-g-a-i, Jagāi, and Mādhāi, M-a-d-h-a-i. Pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari nāme uddharilo, tā'ra sākṣī. Tā'ra sākṣī, t-a-r, sākṣī, s-a-k-s-h-i, sākṣī, jagāi and mādhāi. 
And then last verse is hā hā prabhu nanda-suta. H-a-h-a, hā hā, prabhu, p-r-a-b-h-u, prabhu, nanda-suta, n-a-n-d-a-s-u-t-a. "My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, son of King Nanda..." Vṛṣabhānu-sutā-yuta. V-r-i-s-a-b-h-a-n-u, vṛṣabhānu, sutā, s-u-t...
Pradyumna: V-s... Vṛṣa?
Prabhupāda: Vṛṣabhānu, b-h-a-n-u.
Pradyumna: B-h-a-n-u.
Prabhupāda: Vṛṣabhānu-sutā, s-u-t-a. Sutā-yuta, y-u-t-a. That means, "My Lord Kṛṣṇa, the son of King Nanda, You are now along with Rādhārāṇī, the daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu. So both of You are here. So I am Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura." Narottama, N-a-r-a-t-t-a-m-a, Narottama, dāsa, d-a-s-a, dāsa, kahe, k-a-h-e. "I am Narottama dāsa. I am placing my appeal unto You." Narottama dāsa ka..., nā theliho.

Pradyumna: C-h-...

Pradyumna: A-s-c-h...
Prabhupāda: No. A-c-h-h-e. Āmār, a-m-a-r. "So who else is there beyond Yourself? So don't kick me out by Your lotus feet. Please accept me, because I have no other shelter than Yourself." Is that...? [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Hari hari! bifale janama goṅāinu. This is a song sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, very stalwart ācārya in the line of Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s sampradāya, disciplic succession. He has sung many songs, important songs, and his songs are accepted as Vedic conclusion. Very authoritative songs. So he says, praying to Lord Kṛṣṇa, “My dear Lord,” hari hari, “I have simply spoiled my life.” 
Hari hari bifale janama goṅāinu. Why you have spoiled your life? He says, manuṣya-janama pāiyā, “I got this human form of life,” rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, “but I did not care to worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Therefore I have spoiled my life.” And how it is? It is exactly like one takes poison knowingly. If somebody takes poison unknowingly, there is excuse; but if somebody takes poison knowingly, it is suicidal. So he says, “I have committed suicide simply by not worshiping Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in this human form of life.”
Then he says, golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, saṅkīrtana movement, is nothing material. It is directly imported from the spiritual kingdom known as Goloka Vṛndāvana. So golokera prema-dhana. And it is not ordinary song. It is just the treasure of love of Godhead. So... “But I have no attraction for this.” Rati nā janmilo tāy. “I have no attraction for it. On the contrary,” viṣaya-biṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jwale, “and because I did not accept it, therefore the blazing fire of the poison of material existence is constantly burning me.” 
Dibā-niśi hiyā jwale. “Day and night, my heart is burning on account of this poisonous effect of material existence.” And taribare nā koinu upāy. “But I did not seek any remedy for this.” In other words, the remedy for this blazing fire of material existence is this saṅkīrtana movement. It is imported from the spiritual kingdom. And who has imported it? Who has brought it?
Then he says, brajendra-nandana jei, śaci-suta hoilo sei. Brajendra-nandana, the son of King of Braja. That is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is known as son of Nanda Mahārāja. He was King of Brajabhūmi. So brajendra-nandana jei, the same personality who was formerly the son of Nanda Mahārāja has now appeared as the son of Mother Śacī. Śacī-suta hoilo sei. 
And balarāma hoilo nitāi. And Lord Balarāma has become Nityānanda. So these two brothers adventing, They are delivering all kinds of fallen souls. Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo. As many fallen souls there were within this world, They’re delivering them simply by this chanting process. Hari-nāme uddhārilo, simply by this chanting. How it is possible? Then he says, tāra sākṣī jagāi and mādhāi. The living example is the two brothers, Jagāi and Mādhāi. 
These Jagāi and Mādhāi, two brothers, they happened to be born in a brāhmaṇa family but they turned to be debauch number one. Of course, nowadays, in this age, their qualification is not considered debauch. Their debauchery was because they were drunkard and woman-hunter. Therefore they were called debauch. And meat-eater also. So... But they became later on, delivered by Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda, great devotees.
So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura’s explanation says that in this age although people are drunkard, woman-hunter, meat-eater, and all..., gambler, all kinds of sinful actors, still, if they take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, they’ll be delivered, undoubtedly. This is the blessings of Lord Caitanya. Then Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura prays, hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-sutā-juta. “My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, You are son of King Nanda, and Your consort Rādhārāṇī is the daughter King Vṛṣabhānu. So You are together here standing.” 
Narottama dāsa kahe, nā ṭheliho rāṅgā pāy, “Now I am surrendering unto You, please do not kick me away or push me away with Your lotus feet because I have no other shelter. I am just taking shelter unto Your lotus feet without having any other means. So please accept me and deliver me.” This is the sum and substance of this song.

[O Lord Kṛṣṇa, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, please be merciful to me now. Narottama dāsa says, "O Lord, please do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?"]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu. This is a prayer offered by Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. We have several times sung songs composed by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, and he is very much authorized. His songs are considered on the evidence of Vedas. In other words, he explains Vedic truth in very simple language. 
So he is lamenting, hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu: “My Lord Hari.”Hari means “my Lord”; biphale, “uselessly”; janama, “birth”; goṅāinu, “squandered.” “The valuable human form of life I have squandered uselessly.” Hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu. 
Why? 
manuṣya-janama pāiyā
rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā
“This human form of life was granted to me to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, to worship Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. But instead of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious I have simply squandered my life in useless material sense gratification. Therefore I have spoiled my life,” he is lamenting. 
hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu 
manuṣya-janama pāiyārādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā
“This human form of life was especially meant for becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious and worshiping Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, so,” jāniyāśuniyā biṣa khāinu, “I have taken poison knowingly.” Sometimes poison is administered unknowingly, but “I have knowingly taken the poison. I know that this life is meant for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but without doing this, I have simply squandered my life. Therefore purposely, with intension, I have taken poison.” Jāniyāśuniyā biṣa khāinu. Biṣa means “poison.”
Then he says, golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana: “This hari-saṅkīrtana movement, Kṛṣṇa conscious movement, is brought down directly from Goloka Vṛndāvana.” There this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is going on amongst the devotees in love with Kṛṣṇa. It is not a material thing; it is imported from there, from Goloka Vṛndāvana, golokera prema-dhana. “And this chanting is based on affection and love with Kṛṣṇa”; it is not official chanting. Prema-dhana. Prema-dhana means “an asset of love.” 
So, 
golokera prema-dhana
hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana
rati nā janmila kene tāya
“I have no attraction for this transcendental chanting,” rati nā janmila. Rati means “attraction.” “I could not develop my attraction for this. I developed my attraction for material propensities, and what is the result of my material propensities?” Biṣānale dibā-niśi hiyā jvale. Material propensities means eating, sleeping, mating and defending. These four principles are called material propensities. So they are considered as blazing fire. Biṣānale dibā-niśi hiyā jvale: “The heart is always burning with this blazing fire.” Tarivare nā kainu upāya: “And I did not try to find out if there is any remedy for this blazing fire. Therefore I have wasted my time. Although the holy name, chanting of holy name, is there, I did not search out there.” So rati nā janmila kena tāya.
Now, he says again, “Who has brought…, who has imported this nice transcendental chanting?” He says, brajendra-nandana jei śacī-suta haila sei: “Formerly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as the son of Mahārāja Nanda, Brajendra, the king of Vraja, that the same Supreme Personality has now appeared as śacī-suta, as the son of Śacī devī.” Lord Caitanya's name was Śacī-suta because His mother's name was Śacī devī. “The same personality, or that means Kṛṣṇa Himself, has appeared as Śrī Caitanya, Nimai, the son of Śacī devī,” and balarāma haila nitāi, “and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Balarāma, who was considered elder brother of Kṛṣṇa, He has appeared as Nitāi.” What is Their business? In this age, what is Their business? Papī-tāpī jata chilo hari-nāme uddhārila: “Their business is to deliver all kinds of fallen and sinful conditioned souls.” How is that? Tāra sākṣi jagāi and mādhāi: “The exact evidence is Jagāi and Mādhāi, the typical examples of papīand tāpī.” Jagāi and Mādhāi, two brothers, they were debauched number one. All kinds of sinful activities they were doing. But Nitai, Lord Nītyānanda, delivered them, simply requesting them to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. 
So Lord Caitanya and Nītyānanda set one or two examples—not too many—but they were very prominent examples: Jagāi and Mādhāi. So the purpose was that in this age you cannot find any well-equipped Vedāntist or very learned scholar in self-realization. You will simply find examples like Jagāi and Mādhāi—all debauched number one, addicted to intoxication, sex and meat-eating and all. You will meet only this. The world is full of these persons, Jagāi and Mādhāi. So if they are to be delivered, then no system of self-realization will prove effective—only this system introduced by Lord Caitanya, Nītyānanda, Hare Kṛṣṇa, they will be delivered now. This is a fact. 
papī tāpī jata chila 
hari-nāme uddhārila
tāra sākṣi jagāi and mādhāi
So the evidence is there. When one Jagāi, Mādhāi…, one pair of Jagāi and Mādhāi was delivered, why not many pairs of Jagāi andMādhāi? So they can be delivered simply by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa. 
So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is praying to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, hā hā prabhu nanda-suta bṛṣabhanū-sutā-juta: “My dear Kṛṣṇa, son of Mahārāja Nanda, You are along with Rādhārāṇī,” bṛṣabhanū-sutā. Rādhārāṇīs father's name was Bṛṣabhanū, so She is known as also the daughter of Bṛṣabhanū. So Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, They were very young, so They are addressed as the son and daughter of such-and-such persons. So They become very glad when Their parental names are taken or Their devotees’ name are taken. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is addressing not as Kṛṣṇa—as the son of King Nanda, and Rādhārāṇī as the daughter of King Bṛṣabhanū. So “You are together here, and I am Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura; I am praying to You that ’Don’t kick me away.’ ”  
hā hā prabhu nanda-suta bṛṣabhanū-sutā-juta
karunā karaha ei-bāra
“Now I have come to my consciousness that You are the only deliverer, so I have come to You, so please do not kick me away. Please accept me, because I have no other shelter. I fully surrender unto You.” [end]

Iṣṭa Deve Vijñapti & Purport 6
Prabhupāda: ...especially introduced by the disciplic succession of Lord Caitanya, and this Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, who has sung this hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu, he's a famous ācārya. His compositions are accepted as Vedic truth. So this purport of this song is very nice. He's lamenting, appealing to Hari, the Lord. 
Hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu: "My dear Lord, I have uselessly spoiled my life." Biphale means uselessly, and janama means birth, and goṅāinu means "I have passed." He's representating a common man, as every one of us is simply spoiling our life. They do not know that they are spoiling their life. 
They are thinking that "I've got very nice apartment, very nice car, very nice wife, very nice income, very nice social position." So many things. These are the material attraction. Gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair. 
[child crying] [aside:] Stop it. Oh, that's all... 
The attraction, material attraction, is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in many ways. In one place it is very nicely summarized what is this material attraction. The basic principle of material attraction is sex. [child crying] Pumsaḥ striya mithuni-bhavam etam [SB 5.5.8]. 
[The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of "I and mine.]
A man is hankering after another woman, and the woman is hankering after another man. This is the basic principle of material life. Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam [SB 5.5.8]. 
Mithunī-bhāvam means sex. Tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim. And when they actually come into sexual life, each one of them become too much attracted. 
Hṛdaya-granthim. Granthi means very hard knot: "I cannot leave you." He says, "I cannot leave you. You are my life and soul," and she says, "You are my life and soul." For a few days. [laughs] And then again divorce. You see? 
But the beginning is there. Basic principle of material attraction is this sex life. This is general. Those who have organized the sex life in social convention in so many ways... The marriage is also another convention to give a very finishing nice touch than the animal. That's all. 
Just like sometimes it is said marriage is legalized prostitution. So for social convention the marriage is a license, but it is also based on the sex life. But for keep up social life, one has to accept some regulative principle. Therefore sex life like animals and sex life in marriage, there is difference; it is better. That is accepted in civilized world.
So when they're united some way or other, then next demand is nice apartment, gṛha. The next demand, gṛha-kṣetra, land. Because human civilization is based on land and cow, gavayā dhanavān. Formerly, a person was considered to be rich man by possession of the number of cows, by possession of land, not these papers, this false money. At the present moment, if you have got some printed paper, thousand dollars... They are papers actually. 
When the government is a failure, it has no value. But actually if you possess some land and cows, the government may fail or not fail, your value is there. So that is actual property. Therefore in Sanskrit language it is said gavayā dhanavān. A man is known as rich man by the number of..., by possession of the number of cows. That was the mode of civilization in the Vedic age. 
Gṛha-kṣetra-suta. Suta means children. When you have got apartment, when you have got wife, when you have got..., then next demand is children, suta. Because without children no home life is pleasant. Putra-hīnaṁ gṛhaṁ śūnyam [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]. 
[Life without knowledge is empty, and all directions are void for those without friends. Household life without a son is void, and for the poor the whole world is void.]
A home life is just like desert without children. Children is the attraction of home life. So grha-kṣetra-suta āpta. Āpta means relatives or society. Sutāpta-vittaiḥ: and all these paraphernalia are to be maintained on money. Therefore money is required, vittaiḥ. In this way, one becomes entangled in this material world. Janasya moho 'yam. This is called illusion. Illusion. 
Why illusion? So important things, why illusion? Illusion means that this nice paraphernalia arrangement—home, life, apartment, wife, children, society, position—everything is all right, but as soon as this body is finished, everything is finished; you're in a next platform. You do not know what is next platform. The next platform may be a human being or a cat or a dog or a demigod or anything. You do not know. 
And as soon as you have got a next life, you forget all these things. There is no remembrance what I was, what was my home. Everything is finished. Everything is finished—flash, just like a bubble. By the thrashing of different waves in the ocean, there are so many bubbles immediately generated, and the next moment, oh, they are all finished. Finished. Toye janame punaḥ toye samat[?]. 
In this way the life is going on. The living entity is traveling in many species of life, in many planets. But this human form of life is an opportunity to understand how I am transmigrating from one place to another, one life to another, and simply wasting my time without understanding what is my constitutional position, why I am so much in distress, miseries. 
These things are to be understood in this human form of life. But instead of understanding my real position, the process of life, we reject everything. Simply I am engaged with the gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittaiḥ [SB 5.5.8]. 
[The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of "I and mine.]
Gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittaiḥ—home, society, money, position—everything is all right provided you can utilize it for elevating yourself from these material clutches. Otherwise, if you are simply engaged and captivated by these things, then I am spoiling my life.
So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, representing ourself, he is lamenting, "My dear Lord, I have spoiled my life. I have simply spoiled my life." Why? This life, this human form of life, manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā. This human form of life was meant for understanding what is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Lord, His energy, whatever you call—Hare Kṛṣṇa or Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma, the same thing, the Lord and His energy. 
So, "Instead of making contact with Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, I am simply spoiling my life in sense gratification." So he's lamenting, hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu: "Uselessly I have spoiled my life." 
[O Lord Hari, I have spent my life uselessly. Having obtained a human birth and having not worshiped Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, I have knowingly drunk poison.]
Why? What is your lamentation? He says, golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana. 
[The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vṛndāvana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari's holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns in the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not accepted the means for relieving it.]
This chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, this transcendental vibration, is not any material thing. It is imported from the transcendental abode, golokera. Goloka means the transcendental abode of Kṛṣṇa. 
Golokera prema-dhana. From there, the transcendental abode of Kṛṣṇa... Just like the sunshine, wherefrom it has come? From the sun planet. Everyone knows it. Although you cannot go there, it is far, far beyond your reach, but you can understand that the sunshine is coming from the sun globe. There is no doubt about it. 
Similarly this vibration, this shining, is coming from Kṛṣṇa, Goloka. Golokera prema-dhana. And prema-dhana means this chanting is in love with Kṛṣṇa. So golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana, rati nā janmilo kene tāy. "I've no attachment for this." 
[The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vṛndāvana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari’s holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns in the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not accepted the means for relieving it.]
Why should one be attached to this? That is explained in the next line: viṣaya-viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jvale. Hiyā. Hiyā means heart. Our heart is always burning. Why? In touch with this material sense gratificatory process. No sense gratificatory process is giving me satisfaction. 
I'm trying this way, that way, this way, that way, that way. You see? Just like people are trying sense gratification in so many ways, they have come to the last point, naked picture, naked dance. What is called? That short, what is called?
Devotee: Miniskirt.
Prabhupāda: Miniskirt, yes. [laughs] So because here the basic principle only sex, everyone is inviting, "Yes, come on, sex. Come on, sex." But this way, that way, sex, anyway you enjoy, you cannot be satisfied. That is certain. Because that is not your platform of enjoyment. 
You are spirit soul. Unless you come to the spiritual platform, these material, any kind of sense enjoyment... Therefore you will never be satisfied. You'll simply hankering after, but there will be no satisfaction. 
Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, viṣaya-viṣānale. Viṣaya means these material demands, eating, sleeping, mating, these are called viṣaya. They are just like poison, fire. So everyone is burning. Viṣaya-viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jvale. Jvale means it is burning, my heart is burning. Tari bare nā koinu upāy. "But I did not search out the relief, the immediate relief, hari-saṅkīrtana, this chanting. I have no attachment for this. Therefore I have spoiled my life."
Then he says, brajendra-nandana yei, śacī-suta hoilo sei. Now, this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is introduced by Kṛṣṇa Himself, Vrajendra-nandana. Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Mahārāja Nanda in Vṛndāvana; therefore He is called Vrajendra-nandana, Vrajeśa-tanaya. These are names. So this same Vrajendra-nandana, Kṛṣṇa, has appeared as Śacīnandana. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead takes pleasure when He's addressed with His devotee's name, with His energy's name. Devotee's also His energy. So He has no father. He is father of everyone. But He accepts some devotee. A devotee wants Kṛṣṇa as his son; therefore Kṛṣṇa accepts a devotee as His father. 
So nobody can become His father, but a devotee... Just like this girl, Nandarāṇī, is raising her daughter, always giving service. The child is accepting service from the parents. Her business is only to accept. Torture and accept service. So devotees accept Kṛṣṇa as son so that Kṛṣṇa may simply torture them and accept service. That is the policy. Because the devotee want to render service, so this is the best way of service rendering. The child will draw always service. 
So this conception, fatherhood of the Absolute Truth, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is undoubtedly very good, but there is no service. Father is meant for exacting: "Father, give me this. Father, give me this." And here, the Vaiṣṇava conception, to accept the Supreme as child to render service. Not to accept. No parents accept any service from the child, but he simply gives service.
So anyway, Vrajendra-nandana, the idea of accepting the Lord as son... Mahārāja Nanda accepted Kṛṣṇa as his son, similarly Śacīdevī accepted Lord Caitanya as his [her] son. So both of Them are the one. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, "The same Vrajendra-nandana, Kṛṣṇa, has now appeared as Lord Caitanya, as the son of Śacī. And the same Balarāma has become Nitāi." 
And what is Their business? The business is pāpī-tāpī jata chilo: "They are claiming all kinds of sinful conditioned souls." Their only business is. Because in this age, Kali-yuga, you cannot find any perfectly pious man or saintly person. Everyone is addicted to so many sinful activities. 
So pāpī-tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo. Simply by distributing this chanting, He claimed everyone, however fallen he may be. "Come on, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and become delivered." You see? So nice thing. Pāpī-tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārila. What is the evidence that He has? Ta 'ra sākṣī jagāi and mādhāi. Jagāi-Mādhāi, they were two brothers, debauch number one. You see? 
They were all kinds of sinful affairs. They were drunkard, they were woman hunter, meat-eater, so many things. And, of course, they were born in a very high brāhmaṇa family, but bad association, they became like that. Similarly, at the present age, this human society, although they are coming from the Āryan family, very nice family, but due to association the only environment is there's woman and intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. That's all. So Jagāi-Mādhāi is the specimen, sample of this population, and Lord Caitanya delivered them simply by this Hare Kṛṣṇa. 
So this chanting process, Hare Kṛṣṇa, will actually deliver all these fallen souls without any failure. It is not bogus propaganda. Anyone who will take to this chanting process, whatever, you don't consider about his past life. He will become saintly. He will become a pure Kṛṣṇa conscious person. So pāpī-tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo, ta 'ra sākṣī jagāi-mādhāi. The evidence is Jagāi-Mādhāi.
Then he says, hā hā... When he has come to the senses that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa," then he surrenders. This process, the chanting process, will purify our heart, our burning heart, and one will come to the understanding that "I am eternal servitor of the Supreme, Kṛṣṇa." Then, as soon as he comes to this understanding, as it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā, bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg 7.19], 
[After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.]
"After many, many births, when one person becomes actually wise, a man of wisdom, jñānavān"—jñānavān means wise man—then what does he do? "He surrenders unto Me," Kṛṣṇa says. Why? Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg 7.19]: "Because Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is everything." Sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ: "That kind of great soul is very rare." That is stated in...
But Caitanya Mahāprabhu has made easy to become such kind of great soul simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, at the end he says, hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-sutā-juta. Again the sutā, the son, son of Nanda, and Rādhārāṇī, the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, They are standing. Kṛṣṇa... Vaiṣṇava, they do not worship Kṛṣṇa alone without Rādhārāṇī. 
They do not worship Rāma without Sītā. They do not worship Nārāyaṇa without Lakṣmī. Because the Lord and the energy must be there. We don't say..., we don't believe that God is without any energy. No. "Hare Kṛṣṇa." First the energy is addressed, Harā, Hare, then Kṛṣṇa. 
So here also, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura prays, "My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, You are now present before me with Your internal potency, Your pleasure potency, Rādhārāṇī. So I am surrendering unto You." Hā hā prabhu nanda-sutā. And "Don't neglect me because I am so sinful, my past life is so black. Don't neglect me. Please accept me. Don't kick me away. I surrender unto You." This is the purport of this song.
So this instruction should be taken by all of us. The purificatory process is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as our heart is purified, we completely become convinced that "The Lord is Supreme. I am His eternal servant. I have forgotten this. Servant..., my servitorship is there, but instead of serving the Lord, I am serving my senses. That's all. 
I have never become the master. I am not master of my senses; I am the servant of my senses. That is my position." So why not becoming the servant of the Supreme instead of serving on the servant of the senses? 
You cannot become master. Actually, you become master of the senses when you are actually servant of Kṛṣṇa; otherwise it is not possible. There are two words, gosvāmī and go-dāsa. Persons who are servant of their senses, they are called materialistic go-dāsa, and persons who are master of the senses, they are called gosvāmī. Gosvāmī. 
They control the senses. The tongue wants to eat something which is not... "Oh," he controls. "Oh, tongue, you cannot taste these things. It is not kṛṣṇa-prasāda." Therefore he becomes gosvāmī, master. He does not allow the tongue to eat any nonsense thing except kṛṣṇa-prasāda. He cannot allow his senses, his anything, for sense gratification. Only for the service. That is called devotional service.
Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate [Cc Madhya 19.170]. 
[Bhakti, or devotional service, means engaging all our senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all the senses. When the spirit soul renders service unto the Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and one’s senses are purified simply by being employed in the service of the Lord.]
Bhakti, this devotional service, means when you engage your senses for the satisfaction of the master of the senses. The supreme master of the senses is Kṛṣṇa. So we are trying to apply the senses for our personal service. This is called māyā; this is called illusion. The same senses purified, when they'll be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, that is perfection. So we are not going to stop the activities of the senses, but senses are being purified for being engaged in the service of the Lord. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Thank you very much. [devotees offer obeisances] 
So, any question? Yes.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Prabhupāda, how was it that Lord Jesus was called a son of God? If Kṛṣṇa is usually the son, how come Jesus was the son?
Prabhupāda: Not usually. Kṛṣṇa is father, that I told you. But He becomes son out of His love. Kṛṣṇa is father. Kṛṣṇa's position is father, but He... He's simply father, so He voluntarily becomes a son also sometimes, to taste how to become a son. Son is not His constitutional position. 
Father is His constitutional position. But He voluntarily accepts to become a son. But who is going to be His father? He is the original father. He is a father of everyone. Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā. In the Bhagavad-gītā says there, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya [Bg 14.4]: 
[It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.]
"There are millions, 8,400,000 species of life, and I am the father of all these living entities." So who is going to be His father? Nobody is father, but a devotee, when likes, "My dear Lord, I want a son like You," so Kṛṣṇa accepts: "Oh, where is another son like Me? I'll become your son." That's all. 
Just like Vasudeva and Devakī. In their previous life they underwent severe austerities. They were married couples, but they had no sex. They were determined that "Unless we get the Lord as our son, we are not having any son." So they went on for many years, many thousands years' austerity. 
Then the Lord appeared: "What do you want?" "Sir, I want a son like You." "Where can I get another son like Me? I'll become your son." So Kṛṣṇa, or the Lord, is father of everyone, but He voluntarily accepts to become a son to His devotee. Otherwise His position is always father. 
Yes.
Madhudviṣa: Prabhupāda, I read in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Volume Three, that when one becomes a liberated soul, he attains perfect freedom, and even sometimes that freedom is on the same level as Kṛṣṇa or even more than Kṛṣṇa.
Prabhupāda: Yes.
Madhudviṣa: Can you explain that?
Prabhupāda: Yes. Just like this Vasudeva, he's more than Kṛṣṇa. Yaśodā... You have seen the picture, Yaśodā is binding Kṛṣṇa?
Madhudviṣa: Oh, the little baby. Yes.
Prabhupāda: Yes, He has become... The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is, I mean to say, afraid, who is fearful by everyone, Yaśodā..., and Kṛṣṇa has become fearful to Yaśodā: "My dear mother, kindly do not bind Me. I shall obey your orders." So Yaśodā has become more than God, more than Kṛṣṇa. 
The Māyāvādī philosophers, they want to be one with Kṛṣṇa or one with Lord, but our philosophy is to become more than Kṛṣṇa. [laughter] Why one with Kṛṣṇa? More than Kṛṣṇa. And actually He accepts. He makes His devotee more than Kṛṣṇa. Just like Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa took the part of a driver, and he was the hero of the fight. 
Actually, Kṛṣṇa was the hero, but He gave position to His devotee: "You become the hero. I shall become your charioteer." That's all. Don't you see how Arjuna has become more than Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says, "Arjuna, you are hesitating to fight, but you know that all these person who have assembled in this battlefield, they are not going back. They are already killed. That is My plan. You simply take the credit that you have killed them. That's all." [laughter] That He wants. 
Just like a father wants a son to see him more than himself. If a father is an M.A., he wants to see his son M.A., Ph.D., or something more. He's satisfied. He'll not tolerate anybody to become more than him, but he'll tolerate if his son becomes more than him. I'm giving you a crude example. 
Similarly, Kṛṣṇa, or the Lord, wants to see His devotee more than Himself. That is His pleasure. He takes pleasure in that. So to become a devotee is not ordinary thing. You see? He has got the chance to become more than God. Why equal with God, one with God? No. More than God. Yes. That is our philosophy.
Yes?
Jaya-gopāla: What is the relationship of the surabhī cow with Kṛṣṇa?
Prabhupāda: Huh?
Jaya-gopāla: What is the relationship of the surabhī cow with Kṛṣṇa?
Prabhupāda: They are also... These cows are also devotees, and Kṛṣṇa is fond of keeping cows, taking care of them. The same love affairs, exchange of love. That's all.
Jaya-gopāla: Which...
Prabhupāda: Dāsya-rasa. Dāsya-rasa, servitude. There are different rasas, mellows of relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Śānta, dāsya... Just like Vṛndāvana-bhūmi or the trees, the plants, they are serving Kṛṣṇa silently. And the cows and servants, they are offering superior service. The friends, they are offering service as friend. 
The gopīs, they are... Gopīs, or the motherly gopīs, just like Yaśodā and ladies, offer their..., loving Kṛṣṇa as son, and the younger girls, they're loving Kṛṣṇa as husband, as lover. So in this way in Vṛndāvana there are different transcendental mellows of loving affairs. 
So the cows are on the śānta..., dāsya-rasa, giving service, just like master and servant. They are situated in this transcendental humor. But they're all one with Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is inferior than Kṛṣṇa, but the relationship is exchange of loving service. That's all.
Nandarāṇī: Is our rasa with Kṛṣṇa already established? I mean, is it eternal? Or do we..., can we attain...
Prabhupāda: No. It is already established. You have got eternal relationship. When you become liberated, you realize that your relationship is with Kṛṣṇa like this. You'll develop that taste, whether in śānta-rasa or dāsya-rasa or mādhurya-rasa or vātsalya-rasa. But that is not to be imitated at the present moment. When we are actually liberated. 
To come to that stage, the routine work, regulative work, should be followed: chanting, hearing, worshiping, following the regulative principles. In this way, gradually, as we are purified, we come to the pure consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then at once we understand, "My relationship with Kṛṣṇa is like this." And you are transferred to the Kṛṣṇaloka in that humor.
Dayānanda: We could also have a passive relationship with Kṛṣṇa, like a tree?
Prabhupāda: Yes. That will be revealed, how we are related with Kṛṣṇa. Every relationship is as good as the other. Just like in this material world, everyone's position, he thinks it is very nice. Similarly, in the spiritual, what to speak, they are all equal, but still, one is apprec..., one's aptitude is that "I want to love Kṛṣṇa in this way." Yes. 
So he's there in that way. There must be variety. If there is rasa-līlā, there must be nice trees, nice field, nice cows, nice Yamunā river. Otherwise how it is, simply if the gopīs and Kṛṣṇas are there, if the other things are not there? [chuckles] The background must be there. 
So everything is spiritual. Background is also spiritual. That is creation of Kṛṣṇa. Eko bahu-śyāma. Just like a painter paints a picture, he makes a nice background. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa wants to enjoy, so He has created us in different varieties to supply His pleasure potency. You see. Eko bahu-śyāma. This Vedic literature says that alone He has many. Why? Just to enjoy. Why? Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt [Vedānta-sūtra 1.1.12]. 
[By nature, the Supreme Lord is blissful.]
He's by nature joyful, sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs 5.1]. 
[Kṛṣṇa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.]
So ānanda does not mean that one. No. Variety. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. So that variety, they're all spiritual. Just like the same example: you paint a picture with the same brush and color, but as soon as you make it variety, variegated, it becomes very enjoyable. 
So we don't say that the varieties created by God is false. No. It is real. How can I say it is false? This flower, it is designed by God so nicely, it is colored so nicely. It has got its use. There is variety. Even there is greenness... There is so many things, varieties. There is color display, sometimes a dark red, sometimes it is light red. 
So nicely created by Kṛṣṇa, and I shall say it is false? Why it is false? It is Kṛṣṇa's creation. Let me take it and offer it to Kṛṣṇa. This is called bhakti. This is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I don't enjoy it. It is Kṛṣṇa's creation; it must be offered to Kṛṣṇa. 
And after offering to Kṛṣṇa, you'll enjoy. After offering nice prasāda, Kṛṣṇa is full, Kṛṣṇa is not eating. You'll enjoy. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We don't reject anything. This tape recorder we don't reject. We don't say, "Oh, it is material. We shall not touch." Bring any scientific invention, we shall engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. [laughter] 
We don't say it is false. Why? You have applied your brain, you applied your energy to invent such nice machine. Let it be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. Your life will be successful. That's all. The flower from... The tree from which this flower is grown, if this flower is offered to Kṛṣṇa, his life is successful. 
So it is so nice program, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All-round successful. There is no comparison with this program, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There cannot be any comparison, neither any rivalry with this conception of philosophy, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So try to understand, preach it nicely, and be happy, and let them become happy. 
So you want to chant something or..., no?
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Well, the neighbors, ah...
Prabhupāda: All right. That's all right. We have chanted. Now we can distribute prasādam. [devotees offer obeisances] 
[aside:] You distribute. I want to go to the bathroom. 
[break] "Oh, I don't like this. He may come back." He must be seen as beloved child. First of all he gave him work just like ordinary laborer. He became sick. He's also tasting. That is nice. [laughs] 
So tomorrow we must find out some store. 
[Prabhupāda eats]
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Prabhupāda? I spoke to Puruṣottama. He is coming here.
Prabhupāda: Coming?
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Yes.
Prabhupāda: That's nice.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Brahmānanda said, "Do you know what you are doing to me, Tamāla? Now I have to do all the work here." So he said, "But it's all right." [Prabhupāda laughs] Number-one man.
Prabhupāda: So you may send somebody to help him.
Nandarāṇī: Who is coming? [pause]
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Puruṣottama. He said it was all right, because Puruṣottama can still get a lot of advertisements for Back to Godhead in Los Angeles area.
Prabhupāda: Oh, you can [indistinct].
Devotee: When's he coming? [end]

This is actual picture of Kṛṣṇa, rādhā-mādhava giri-vara-dhārī. Original Kṛṣṇa this is. Rādhā-mādhava giri-vara-dhārī. Vraja-jana-vallabha. His business is to please the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. That's all. He has no other business. And the vraja-jana also, they have no other business than to please Kṛṣṇa. 
That's all. This is original Kṛṣṇa. Vraja-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhārī. And first business is Rādhā-Mādhava. Of course, Kṛṣṇa is concerned with everyone, especially concerned with Rādhārāṇī. Rādhā-mādhava kuñja-bihārī, and He enjoys with Rādhā in different kuñjas, bushes, of Vṛndāvana. 
And then, yaśodā-nandana. Next He wants to please His mother, Yaśodā. Yaśodā-nandana vraja-jana-rañjana. And Kṛṣṇa is very affectionate to all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. The son of Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja. They love Kṛṣṇa, all the elderly persons. They love. 
Elderly ladies and persons, they love Kṛṣṇa. "Oh, here is the son of Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja.'' They're all tenants and subordinates to Nanda Mahārāja. Nanda Mahārāja is the chief man in Vṛndāvana, and they are their subjects. So they are affectionate to Kṛṣṇa because He happens to be son of Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja.
And Kṛṣṇa's business is... [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

So this is the original nature of Kṛṣṇa, original nature of Kṛṣṇa. He is Rādhā-Mādhava. He is the lover of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. And kuñja-vihārī, always enjoying the company of the gopīs within the bushes of Vṛndāvana forest. Rādhā-mādhava kuñja-vihārī. So He’s not only lover of Rādhārāṇī, but braja-jana-vallabha. The whole residents of Vṛndāvana, they love Kṛṣṇa. They do not know anything else. 
They do not know whether Kṛṣṇa is God or not, neither they are very much harassed that “I shall love Kṛṣṇa if He is God.” “He may be God or He may be whatever He is. It doesn’t matter, but we love Kṛṣṇa, that’s all.” That is called unnalloyed love. “If Kṛṣṇa is God, then I shall love Him”—this is conditional love. This is not pure love. 
Kṛṣṇa may be God or whatever He may be, but by His wonderful acts, the Vrajavāsīs, they are thinking, “Oh Kṛṣṇa, He is very wonderful child, maybe some demigod. Maybe some demigod.” Because people are generally under impression that the demigods are all-powerful. They’re powerful within this material world. But they do not know that Kṛṣṇa is above all of them. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs 5.1]. 
[Kṛṣṇa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.]
The highest demigod, Brahmā, is giving his opinion, “The supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa.” So as the residents of Vṛndāvana, they love Kṛṣṇa without any condition, similarly, Kṛṣṇa also loves them. 
Vraja-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhārī. When the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana were in danger because they stopped Indra-yajña and Indra became very angry, and he sent very great, powerful cloud and rained over Vṛndāvana incessantly for seven days, so when the inhabitants became very much disturbed, Kṛṣṇa, although He was only seven years old boy, He saved them by lifting the Govardhana Hill. So He taught Indradeva, demigod, that “To stop your disturbance is the business of My little finger, that’s all.” [laughter] So he came down to his knees. These things we’ll find in Kṛṣṇa book. 
So as Gopī-jana-vallabha, His only business is how to protect gopī-jana. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is how to become one of the gopī-jana. Then Kṛṣṇa will save us from any danger, even by lifting a hill or mountain. Kṛṣṇa is so kind and so powerful. When Kṛṣṇa lifted the hill, He did not practice some yoga system. That is God. Although He was a child, He was playing like a child, He was dealing like a child, but when there was need, He was manifesting as God. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa. Not that He has to go and practice some yoga system, then He becomes God. No. He’s not that type of God, not manufactured God. He’s God.
So gopī-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhārī. And as a child, as beloved child of Yaśodā, Yaśodā-nandana,... Kṛṣṇa likes to be a child of a devotee. He wants to be chastised from His devotee father and mother. Because everyone worships Him, nobody goes to chastise Him, so He takes pleasure when a devotee chastises Him. That is Kṛṣṇa’s service. If Kṛṣṇa takes pleasure being chastised, so the responsibility is taken by a devotee: “All right, I shall become Your father and chastise You.” When Kṛṣṇa wants to fight, one of His devotee becomes Hiraṇyakaśipu and fights with Him. So all activities of Kṛṣṇa is with His devotees. He is... Therefore, to become associate of Kṛṣṇa, to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness... 
Yaśodā-nandana vraja-jana-rañjana. His only business is how to satisfy... As braja-jana’s business is how to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, similarly, Kṛṣṇa’s business is how to satisfy braja-jana. This is reciprocation of love. Yamunā-tīra-vana-cārī. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is wandering on the banks of Yamunā to please the gopīs, the cowherd boys, the birds, beasts, calves. They are not ordinary birds, beasts, calves or men. They are on the top of self-realization. Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ. After many, many lives they got that position, to play with Kṛṣṇa.
So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that anyone can go to Kṛṣṇaloka and become His associate, as a friend or so many other things, as a servant, as father, as mother. And Kṛṣṇa is agreeable to any one of these propositions. These things are described very nicely in our Teachings of Lord Caitanya. So Kṛṣṇa does not go even a step from Vṛndāvana. The original Kṛṣṇa is Vṛndāvana. That is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā,
cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambrahma-sevyamānaṁ
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ
 [Bs 5.29]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakṣmīs or gopīs.]
Brahmā is accepting the Supreme Personality of Govinda, Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana. Veṇuṁ kvaṇantam: “He is engaged in playing flute.”
aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ
barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam
kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
[Bs 5.30]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals with head decked with peacock's feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupids.]
So take advantage of these books, this knowledge, and this prasādam, this chanting, and be happy and go to Kṛṣṇa. So nice thing. All right.

Prabhupāda: ...left by the six Gosvāmīs?" Ākuti means "eagerness." Because Rūpa Gosvāmī is the father of devotional service, he has written a book called Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, in which there are nice directions on devotional service. These topics are also dealt with in Caitanya-caritāmṛta and other books, and we have given the summary of those directions in our book Teachings of Lord Caitanya. One has to learn of the conjugal loving affairs of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the teachings of these six Gosvāmīs. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura directs us not to try to understand the conjugal love of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa by our own endeavor. We should try to understand this yugala-pīriti, conjugal love, under the direction of the Gosvāmīs.
As long as the mind is too much absorbed in materialistic thought, one cannot enter into the kingdom of Vṛndāvana. But Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, viṣaya chāriyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana kabe hāma herabo śrī-bṛndābana: "When the mind is completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then I shall be able to understand Vṛndāvana and the conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and then my spiritual life will be successful."

Prabhupāda: Music. Na vidyā sangīta uttamam. The Vedic mantras were all through music. Sāma Veda. Sāma Veda is full of music.

[SB 12.13.1]
[Sūta Gosvāmī said: Unto that personality whom Brahmā, Varuṇa, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise by chanting transcendental hymns and reciting the Vedas with all their corollaries, pada-kramas and Upaniṣads, to whom the chanters of the Sāma Veda always sing, whom the perfected yogīs see within their minds after fixing themselves in trance and becoming fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, and whose limit can never be found by any demigod or demon—unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead I offer my humble obeisances.]
Sāmagāḥ. Sāmagāḥ means the followers of Sāma Veda. Gayānti. They are always in music. Through musical vibration they are approaching the Supreme. Sāmagāḥ. Gāyanti. Gāyanti means singing. So Vedic mantras are sung. This whole Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, can be sung very nicely. And it is Vedic mantra, chanting. Simply by hearing the vibration, people will be benefited, even they do not understand. This mantra you chant?

Their inclinations toward Kṛṣṇa are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both.]

Mānasa, deho, geho, jo kichu mor. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. He's teaching the process of full surrender. Mānasa, deho, geho, jo kichu mor. First of all, he is surrendering the mind, because mind is the origin of all kinds of speculations; and surrendering, rendering devotional service means first controlling the mind. Therefore he says mānasa, means "mind," then deha: "senses." Śarīra. Deha means this body; body means senses. 
So, if we surrender the mind unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then automatically the senses also become surrendered. Then, "my home." Deha, geho. Geho means home. Jo kichu mor. Our all possessions are comprising these three things: mind, body and our home. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura proposes to surrender everything. Arpilū tuwā pade, nanda-kiśor. Nanda-kiśor is Kṛṣṇa. So "I am surrendering my mind, my body and my home unto You." Now, sampade vipade, jīvane-maraṇe: "Either I am in happiness or I am in distress, either I am in living condition or I am dead." 
Dāy mama gelā, tuwā o-pada baraṇe: "Now I am relieved. I am feeling relief because I have surrendered unto You everything." Mārobi rākhobi-jo icchā tohārā: "Now it is up to You whether You like to keep me or You want to kill me; that depends on You." Nitya-dāsa prati tuwā adhikārā: "You have got every right to do whatever You think right in relation with Your servant. I am Your eternal servant." Janmāobi moe icchā jadi tor: "If you so desire"—because a devotee goes back to Home, goes back to Godhead—therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura proposes, "If You like that I shall again take birth, it doesn't matter." 
Bhakta-gṛhe jani janma hau mor: "That's only request is that if I have to take my birth, please kindly give me the chance of taking my birth in a devotee's house." Kīṭa-janma hau jathā tuwā dās: "I don't mind if I am born as an insect, but I must be in the house of a devotee." Bahir mukha brahma-janme nāhi āś: "I do not like nondevotee life. Even if I am born as a Lord Brahmā. I want to remain with the devotees.'' Bhukti-mukti-spṛhā vihīna je bhakta: "I want such devotee who doesn't care for material happiness or spiritual liberation.'' 
Labhaite tāko saṅga anurakta: "I simply desire to be associated with such pure devotees.'' Janaka jananī, dayita, tanay: "Now, henceforward You are my father, You are my brother, You are my daughter, You are my son, You are my Lord, You are my spiritual master, You are my husband, everything You are.'' Bhakativinoda kohe, śuno kāna: "My Lord, Kāna-Kṛṣṇa, You are the Lover of Rādhārānī, but You are my life and soul, kindly give me protection."

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, is the sublime method for reviving our transcendental consciousness. As living spiritual souls, we are all originally Kṛṣṇa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter from time immemorial, our consciousness is now adulterated by the material atmosphere. The material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called māyā, or illusion. Māyā means that which is not. 
And what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of the material nature, while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the all-powerful master, it is called illusion. We are trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore, although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our eternal Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, is the transcendental process for reviving the original pure consciousness. By chanting this transcendental vibration, we can cleanse away all misgivings within our hearts. The basic principle of such misgivings is the false consciousness that I am the lord of all I survey.
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original natural energy of the living entity. In the beginning, there may be not the presence of all transcendental ecstasies, which are eight in number. There are: Being stopped as though dumb, perspiration, standing up of hairs on the body, dislocation of voice, trembling of the body, crying in ecstasy, trance. 
But there is no doubt that chanting for a while takes one immediately to the spiritual platform, and one shows the first symptom of this in the urge of dance along with the chanting of the mantra. We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in this chanting and dancing. The material energy, called māyā, is also one of the multi-energies of the Lord. And we the living entities are also the energy, marginal energy, of the Lord. 
These three words, namely Harā, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, are the transcendental seeds of the mahā-mantra. The chanting is a spiritual call for the Lord and His energies, to give protection to the conditioned soul. This chanting is exactly like the genuine cry of a child for its mother's presence. 
No other means of spiritual realization is as effective in this age of quarrel and hypocrisy as the mahā-mantra: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Vande 'ham means "I am offering my respectful obeisances." Vande. V-a-n-d-e. Vande means "offering my respectful obeisances." Aham. Aham means "I." Vande 'ham śrī-gurūn: all the gurus, or spiritual masters. The offering of respect direct to the spiritual master means offering respects to all the previous ācāryas. Gurūn means plural number. All the ācāryas. They are not different from one another. Because they are coming in the disciplic succession from the original spiritual master and they have no different views, therefore, although they are many, they are one.
Vande 'ham śrī-gurūn śrī-yuta-pada-kamalam. Śrī-yuta means "with all glories, with all opulence." Pada-kamala: "lotus feet." Offering of respect to the superior begins from the feet, and blessing begins from the head. That is the system. The disciple offers his respect by touching the lotus feet of the spiritual master, and the spiritual master blesses the disciple by touching his head. Therefore it is said, "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of all the ācāryas.'' Śrī-yuga-pada-kamalaṁ śrī-gurūn vaiṣṇavāṁś ca. Gurūn means spiritual master, and vaiṣṇavāṁś ca means all their followers, devotees of Lord.
Spiritual master means they must have many followers. They are all Vaiṣṇavas. They are called prabhus, and the spiritual master is called prabhupāda, because on his lotus feet there are many prabhus. Pada means lotus foot. So all these Vaiṣṇavas, they are all prabhus. So they are also offered respectful... Not that the spiritual master alone, but along with his associates. And these associates are all Vaiṣṇavas, his disciples. They are also devotees of the Lord; therefore they should also be offered respectful obeisances. This is the process.
Then śrī-rūpam. The spiritual master is descending from the six Gosvāmīs. Out of the six Gosvāmīs, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī and his elder brother Sanātana Gosvāmī are heading the list. Śrī-rūpaṁ sāgrajātam. Agrajātam means his elder brother..., eldest brother. Śrī-rupaṁ sāgrajātaṁ saha-gaṇa-raghunāthānvitam. They are also associated with other Gosvāmīs, two Raghunātha, raghunāthān, plural number. There were Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī. Then Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī. 
So all they are offered respected obeisances one after another. And after finishing respectful obeisances to the spiritual master and the Gosvāmīs, then we approach Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya is also approached with His associates. 
[break] Sāvadhūtam, sādvaitam. Sa means "with.'' Advaita, Advaita Gosāi. And avadhūta means Nityānanda. So with Advaita and with Nityānanda, the offering goes to the Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. 
So after finishing all these obeisances one after another, according to the system, then śrī-rādhā-kṛṣṇa-pādān, then we approach Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa is also associate. Kṛṣṇa is associated with Rādhārāṇī, and He is associated with Her immediate companions like Lalitā, Viśākhā and others. 
So this is the process of offering respectful obeisances to the Deity. We cannot approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa directly. We have to approach through the spiritual master, through the Gosvāmīs, through the associates of Lord Caitanya. Then we approach Rādhā, then Kṛṣṇa. If one approaches Kṛṣṇa through this channel of disciplic succession, his efforts becomes successful. Otherwise, if he wants to approach Kṛṣṇa directly, it will be futile endeavor. [end]

Mukunda-mālā-stotra & Purport 1

 [MM 33]
[O Lord Kṛṣṇa, at this moment let the royal swan of my mind enter the tangled stems of the lotus of Your feet. How will it be possible for me to remember You at the time of death, when my throat will be choked up with mucus, bile, and air?]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This verse, prayer, is taken from one book known as Mukunda-mālā-stotra. This prayer was offered by one king whose name was Kulaśekhara. He was a great king, at the same time a great devotee. There are many instances in the history of Vedic literature that the kings were very great devotees, and they are called rājarṣīs. Rājarṣīs means: although they are on the royal throne, they are all saintly persons. 
So this Kulaśekhara, King Kulaśekhara, is praying to Kṛṣṇa that "My dear Kṛṣṇa, the swan of my mind may now be entrapped with the stem of Your lotus feet. Because, at the point of death, the three elements of bodily functions, namely the mucus, and the bile, and the air, they will overlap, and there will be a choking in the voice, so I shall not be able to utter Your sweet Holy Name at the point of my death.'' 
The comparison is given in this way, that the white swan, whenever it finds a lotus flower, it goes there and sports by diving into the water and entangling him in the stem of the lotus flower. So King Kulaśekhara wants that in the healthy stage of his mind and body, he may be immediately entangled with the stem of the lotus feet of the Lord and die immediately. The idea is that one should take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness while his mind and body is in good condition. 
Do not wait for the last stage of your life. Just go on practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness while your body and mind is a healthy state, and then at the time of death you shall be able to remember Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes and be immediately transferred to the spiritual kingdom.

[O Lord Kṛṣṇa, at this moment let the royal swan of my mind enter the tangled stems of the lotus of Your feet. How will it be possible for me to remember You at the time of death, when my throat will be choked up with mucus, bile, and air?]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

[This] verse was sung by King Kulaśekhara, a great king, but at the same time, a great devotee of the Lord. His songs are recorded in the book known as Mukunda-mālā-stotra. That is very famous book. It is sung by many devotees. So it does not matter whether a man is king or a poor mendicant, everyone has the facility to become the greatest devotee of the Lord. 
So he's praying, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, Your feet is lotus.'' Generally we say "lotus feet." But where the lotus flower is there, the white swans, they come to the lotus flower and try to play with the stem. They sport, going down the water, and be entangled with the stem of that lotus flower. That is their sporting. So King Kulaśekhara is praying that "Let the swan of my mind be immediately entered into the network of the stem of Your lotus feet.'' 
So that means he wants to engage his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord immediately. There is no question of delaying. He says that "Now I am in sound mind. If I think that I shall think of Your lotus feet at the time of death, there is no certainty. Because at the time of death, the whole body becomes dislocated. The whole function becomes dismantled."
The body's supposed to be conducted by three elements, kapha-pitta-vāyu, cold and bile and air. So when these three elements work simultaneously, there is no disease in the body, but as soon as there is overlapping disruption of these three elements, the body becomes diseased. And when it is not possible to bring them again in their regulative principle, a man dies. That is the verdict of Āyurveda śāstra. 
So death takes place when these three elements become overlapped with one another. And the symptom is that there is a sound on the throat which is called "garhh, garhh." That means the patient cannot speak. The throat is choked up, and he becomes suffocated and dies. So this is the last stage symptom of his body.
So King Kulaśekhara says, that "I cannot wait up to that time when everything will be topsy-turvied. Now my mind is sound. Let me enter immediately in the stem of Your lotus feet.'' That means he's praying, "Let me die in the sound condition of my life, so that I can think of Your lotus feet.'' In other words, he's giving us lessons that if we do not practice to engage our mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa when our mind is sound, how it is possible to think of Him at the time of death?

[My dear Kṛṣṇa, Your Lordship has protected us from a poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest, and from the battle where great generals fought. And now You have saved us from the weapon of Aśvatthāmā.]

[SB 1.8.28]
[My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. In distributing Your mercy, You are equal to everyone. The dissensions between living beings are due to social intercourse.]

[SB 1.8.29]
[O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and so are misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.]

[My dear Kṛṣṇa, Yaśodā took up a rope to bind You when You committed an offense, and Your perturbed eyes overflooded with tears, which washed the mascara from Your eyes. And You were afraid, though fear personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.]

nāma amani, udita haya,
bhakata-gītā-sāme
[When the great soul Nārada Muni plays his stringed vīṇā, the holy name, Rādhikā-ramaṇa descends and immediately appears amidst the kīrtana of the Lord's devotees.]
This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. The purport of this song is that Nārada Muni, the great soul, says, he's playing on his string instrument called vīṇā. Vīṇā is a string instrument carried by Nārada Muni. So he is playing on the instrument as vibrating the sound rādhikā-ramaṇa. Kṛṣṇa's another name is Rādhika-Ramaṇa. 
So as soon as he stroke on the string, immediately all the devotees began to respond him, and it becomes a very beautiful vibration. Amiya dhārā variṣe ghana. And when the singing was going on with the string instrument, it appeared that there is a shower of nectarean. And all the devotees then in ecstasy they were dancing to the fullest extent of their satisfaction. 
Then, while they were dancing, it appeared that they became intoxicated by drinking the beverage called mādhurī pūra. And as one becomes mad almost by drinking, similarly, in ecstasy, all the devotees they became mad. And some of them were crying, and some of them were dancing, and some of them, although they could not dance publicly, within their heart they were dancing. 
In this way, Lord Śiva immediately embraced Nārada Muni, and he began to talk in ecstatic voice. And seeing Lord Śiva, he's dancing with Nārada Muni, Lord Brahmā also joined, and he began to say, "All of you, kindly chant haribol, haribol!" In this way, gradually the king of heaven, Indra, he also joined with great satisfaction and began to dance and chant, "hari hari bol."
In this way, by the influence of transcendental vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe became ecstatic, and Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, "When the whole universe became ecstatic. Then my desire was satisfied and I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of Rūpa Gosvāmī that let this chanting of hari-nāma go on nicely like this."

This is a song sung by Locana Dāsa Ṭhākura, almost a contemporary of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He has got many books on the life and precepts of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So he is saying that Lord Nityānanda is full of good qualities, guṇa-maṇi. Guṇa-maṇi means the jewel of all qualities. So nitāi guṇa-maṇi āmār nitāi guṇa-maṇi. He is repeatedly uttering that Lord Nityānanda is the reservoir of all good qualities. 
Āniyā premera vanyā bhāsāilo avanī. And on account of His spiritual qualities, he inundated the whole world by the flood of love of God. It is by His kindness people can feel what is love of God. Premer vanyā loiyā nitāi āilā gauḍa-deśe. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu left home and took sannyas, He made His headquarter at Jagannātha Purī. So after His accepting the sannyas order, when He left His home and country Lord Nityānanda Prabhu also accompanied Him up to Jagannātha Purī. 
So after a few days, Lord Caitanya requested Him that "If both of us remain here, then who will preach in Bengal?" Bengal is known as gauḍa-deśe. So under the order of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He brought from Him the flood of love of Godhead and He distributed the whole of Bengal, gauḍa-deśe. And in that flood of love of God, all devotees became drowned. Only those who were not devotees, they could not drown but they were floating, dīna hīna bāche. But so far Nityānanda Prabhu is concerned, He does not make any discrimination between devotees and nondevotees. 
Dīna hīna patita pāmara nāhi bāche. Poor or rich or enlightened or foolish, everyone could take the instruction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and become drowned in the ocean of love of Godhead. Such love of Godhead is brahmār durlabha. Even Lord Brahmā, who is the supreme teacher within this universe, he also cannot relish. But by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Mahāprabhu, this love of Godhead was distributed to everyone without any discrimination. So ābaddha karuṇā-sindhu, it was just like a big ocean blocked all sides. Ocean of love of Godhead is a big ocean, but it was not inundated. 
So Nityānanda Prabhu cut a canal from the ocean, and He brought the canal in every door. Ghare ghare bule prema-amiyāra bān. The flood of the nectar of love of Godhead was thus distributed in each and every home in Bengal. Actually still Bengal is overwhelmed when there is talk of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu. 
Locan bole, now the author is speaking on his behalf that anyone who does not take the advantage given by Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, so in his opinion he thinks that such a person knowingly is committing suicide.

Nitāi-Pada-Kamala & Purport 1
[sings: Nitāi-pada-kamala] [break]


Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Nitāi-pada-kamala, koṭi-candra-suśītala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy. 
[The lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda are a shelter where one will get the soothing moonlight not only of one but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have real peace, it should take shelter of Lord Nityānanda. Unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, it will be very difficult for him to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. If one actually wants to enter into the dancing party of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda.]
This is a very nice song sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He is advising that nitāi-pada, the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda... Kamala means lotus feet, er, lotus, and pada means feet. So nitāi-pada-kamala means the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda. Koṭi-candra-suśītala: it is just a shelter where you will get the soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. Just we have to imagine what is the aggregate total value of the soothing shine of millions of moons.
Koṭi-candra-suśītala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy. Jagat, this material world, which is progressing towards hell, and there is always a blazing fire, everyone is struggling hard, nobody finds peace. Therefore, if the world wants to have real peace, then it should take shelter under the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, which is supposed to be cooling like the shining moon, millions in number. 
Nitāi-pada-kamala, koṭi-candra-suśītala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy. Jurāy means relief. If you actually want relief from the struggle of existence, and if you actually want to extinguish the blazing fire of material pangs, then Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura advises, "Please take shelter of Lord Nityānanda.'' 
What will be the result of accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda? He says that heno nitāi bine bhāi: "Unless you take shelter under the shade of lotus feet of Nityānanda,'' rādhā-kṛṣṇa pāite nāi, "it will be very difficult to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.'' Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa... 
This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for approaching Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, to be associated with the Supreme Lord in His sublime pleasure dance. That is the aim of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's advice is that "If you actually want to enter into the dancing party of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, then you must take shelter of the lotus feet of Nityānanda."
Then he says, se sambandha nāhi jā'r. Sambandha means connection, or contact. "So anybody who has not contacted a relationship with Nityānanda," se sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r, "then he is supposed to have spoiled his human birth." In other song also, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu [Prārthanā Song 4]: 
[O Lord Hari, I have wasted my life. Although I have taken this rare human birth, like a miser, I have not served Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and thus I have knowingly drunk poison.]
"Anyone who does not approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the relationship of Nityānanda, his life is uselessly spoiled.'' Se sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r. Bṛthā means useless; janma means life; tāra means his; and sambandha means relationship. So "Anyone who has no relationship with Nityānanda, he is simply spoiling his..., the boon of human form of life.'' 
Why he is spoiling? Se paśu boro durācār. Se means that; paśu, animal; durācār, dura, misbehaved, mostly misbehaved. Because without our elevation to Kṛṣṇa consciousness through the mercy of Lord Caitanya-Nityānanda, the life is simply animal propensities. That's all. Sense gratification. 
And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that ordinary animal, he can be tamed, but a human being, when he is animalistic, when he has simply animal propensities, oh, he is horrible; he cannot be tamed. Ordinary cats and dogs, even tiger, can be tamed. But a human being, when he goes out of his way, because human life is meant for being elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if he doesn't take to that, then his higher intelligence will be simply misused for animal propensities, and it is very difficult to tame him.
The enactment of state laws cannot make a man, a thief, an honest man, because he cannot be tamed. His heart is polluted. Every man sees that a person committing criminal offense is punished by the government. And in scriptural injunction there is mention that "If you do this, you will be punished in the hell.'' 
He has heard from the scripture, and he has practically seen by the punishment of state laws. Still, he is not tamed. He cannot be tamed. So why? Because he hasn't got his relationship with Nityānanda. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, durācāra. Durācāra means very much misbehaved. He cannot be tamed. Sei paśu boro durācār.  
And what they are doing? Nitāi nā bolilo mukhe. They do not know who is Nityānanda, so never says "Lord Nityānanda'' or "Lord Caitanya.'' So nitāi nā bolilo mukhe, majilo saṁsāra-sukhe. Majilo means becomes absorbed, dipped into the so-called material enjoyment. They don't care who is Nityānanda or Caitanya. So nitāi nā bolilo mukhe. Because his life is animalistic, sei paśu boro durācār, very difficult to be tamed, so he is going down, deep into this material existence.
Vidyā-kule ki koribe tār. Somebody may says, "Oh, why he is going to hell? He is so much educated, he has got academic qualification, he has got degrees." Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura replies, vidyā-kule ki koribe tār: "If he has no connection with Nityānanda and if he does not come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his vidyā, or his so-called academic education, and kula, and birth in high family or great nation, will not protect him, because nature's law will act." 
Either you are born in a very big family or nation, or either you have got a very advanced academic education, at the time of death your work will be judged and you will get another body according to that work. So vidyā kule ki koribe tār. 
Why they are doing so, these animals, human animals? Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā: "They have become maddened by a false concept of this bodily life." Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā: "And for this reason they have completely forgotten their eternal relationship with Nityānanda." 
Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā, asatyere satya kari māni: "Such forgetful persons accept the illusory energy as fact." Asatyere. Asatya means which is not fact. In other words, it is called māyā. Māyā means which has no existence, a temporary illusion only. So such persons who have no contact with Nityānanda, they accept this illusion as fact, this illusory body as fact. Asatyere satya kori māni.
Then he says, nitāiyer koruṇā habe, braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe. He says that "If you actually want to approach the association of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, then try to achieve the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. When He will be merciful upon you, then you will be able to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.'' Dharo nitāi-caraṇa duḥkhāni. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura advises us that "You firmly catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda.''
Then again he says, nitāiyer caraṇa satya. One may not misunderstand that as he has caught hold of this māyā, similarly, the lotus feet of Nityānanda may also be something like that māyā, illusion. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura confirms that nitāiyer caraṇa satya: "The lotus feet of Nityānanda is not illusion; it is transcendental fact, satya.'' Nitāiyer caraṇa satya, tāṅhāra sevaka nitya: "And everyone who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of Nityānanda, he is also transcendental.'' 
If anyone is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, immediately he achieves his transcendental position, spiritual platform. And spiritual platform means eternal, blissful. So anyone who engages himself in the service of Nityānanda, it is supposed that he is also immediately in his eternal position. Nitāiyer caraṇa satya, tāṅhāra sevaka nitya, nitāi-pada sadā koro āśa. Therefore he advises that "You always hope to catch the lotus feet of Nityānanda."
Narottama boro duḥkhī. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, the ācārya, he is taking for himself that "I am very unhappy." He is representing ourselves. He is liberated, but representing ourself. "My dear Lord, I am very unhappy." Nitāi more koro sukhī: "So I am praying Lord Nityānanda to make me happy." Rākho rāṅgā caraṇera pāśa: "Please keep me in some corner of your red lotus feet." 
That's all. [end]

Nitāi-Pada-Kamala & Purport 2
Appearance Day of Lord Nityananda
January 31st, 1969, Los Angeles

(1)
nitāi-pada-kamala, koṭi-candra-suśītala
je chāyāy jagata jurāy

The lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda are a shelter where one will get the soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have real peace, it should take shelter of Lord Nityānanda. Unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, it will be very difficult for him to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. If one actually wants to enter into the dancing party of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda.]

nitāi nā bolilo mukhe, majilo saṁsāra-sukhe
vidyā-kule ki koribe tār
[Anyone who has not established his relationship with Nityānanda Prabhu is understood to have spoiled his valuable human birth. Such a human being is actually an uncontrollable animal. Because he never uttered the holy name of Nityānanda, he has become merged into so-called material happiness. What can his useless education and family tradition do to help him?]
(3)
ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā

[Being maddened after false prestige and identification with the body, one is thinking, "Oh, what is Nityānanda? What can He do for me? I don't care." The result is that he is accepting something false to be truth. If you actually want to approach the association of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, you must first achieve the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. When He is merciful toward you, then you will be able to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Therefore you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda.]

[The lotus feet of Nityānanda are not illusion; they are a fact. One who engages in the transcendental loving service of Nityānanda is also transcendental. Always try to catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda. This Narottama dāsa is very unhappy, therefore I am praying to Lord Nityānanda to make me happy. My dear Lord, please keep me close to Your lotus feet.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Nitāi-pada-kamala, koti-candra-suśitala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy. This is a song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a great ācārya of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava sampradāya. He has written many songs about the Vaiṣṇava philosophy, and they are approved as completely corresponding with Vedic instructions. So here Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is singing that "The whole world is suffering under the blazing fire of material existence. Therefore, if one takes the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda...," whose birthday is today, 31st January, 1969. 
So we should relish this instruction of Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura that in order to get relief from the pangs of blazing fire of this material existence, one should take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda because it is as cooling as the moon rays combined together of millions of moons. That means one will immediately find peaceful atmosphere. Just like a man works whole day and if he comes under the moonshine, he feels relief. Similarly, any materialistic man who comes under the shelter of Lord Nityānanda will immediately feel that relief.
Then he says, nitāi-pada-kamala, koṭi-candra-suśitala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy, heno nitāi bine bhāi, rādhā-kṛṣṇa pāite nāi, dharo nitāi-caraṇa du'khāni. He says that "If you are anxious to go back to home, back to Godhead, and become associate with Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, then the best policy is to take shelter of Nityānanda." Then he says, se sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r: "One who has not been able to contact Nityānanda, then one should think of himself that he has simply spoiled his valuable life." Bṛthā janma gelo, bṛthā means for nothing, and janma means life. 
Gelo tā'r, spoiled. Because he has not made connection with Nityānanda. The Nityānanda, very name suggests... Nitya means eternal. Ānanda means pleasure. Material pleasure is not eternal. That is the distinction. Therefore those who are intelligent, they are not interested with this flickering pleasure of material world. Every one of us, as living entity, we are searching after pleasure. But the pleasure which we are seeking, that is flickering, temporary. That is not pleasure. Real pleasure is nityānanda, eternal pleasure. So anyone who has no contact with Nityānanda, it is to be understood that his life is spoiled.
Se sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r, sei paśu boro durācār. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura uses here very harsh word. He says that such human being is an animal, an uncontrollable animal. As there are some animals that cannot be tamed, so anyone who has not contacted Nityānanda, he should be considered as an untamed animal. Sei paśu boro durācār. Why? Because nitāi nā bolilo mukhe: "He never uttered the holy name of Nityānanda." And majilo saṁsāra-sukhe, "and become merged into this material happiness." 
Vidyā-kule ki koribe tār. "That nonsense does not know that what will his education and family and tradition and nationality will help him?" These things cannot help him. These are all temporary things. Simply, if we want eternal pleasure, we must contact Nityānanda. Vidyā-kule ki koribe tār. Vidyā means education, and kula means family, nationality. So we may have a very nice family connection, we may have very nice national prestige, but after ending this body, these things will not help me. I'll carry my work with me, and according to that work, I shall have to accept by force another type of body. It may be something other than human body. So these things cannot protect us or give us the real pleasure. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura advises that vidyā-kule ki koribe tār.
Then he says, ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā. "Being maddened after false prestige and identification..." False identification with the body and prestige of bodily relationship, it is called ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā. One is mad after this false prestige. Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā. Due to this false prestige we are thinking, "Oh, what is Nityānanda? What can He do for me? I don't care." So these are the signs of false prestige. 
Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsa..., asatyere satya kori māni. The result is that I am accepting something which is false. For example, I am accepting this body. This body, I am not this body. Therefore, with false identification I am becoming entangled more and more. So one who is puffed up with this false prestige, ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pā..., asatyere satya kori māni, he accepts something wrong as right.
Then he says, nitāiyer koruṇā habe, braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe. If you are actually serious about going back to home, back to Godhead, then please seek after the mercy of Nityānanda. Nitāiyer koruṇā habe, braja rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe, dharo nitāi-caraṇa du'khāni: "Please catch up the lotus feet of Nityānanda." Then he says, nitāiyer caraṇa satya. One may think that as we catch hold of so many shelter, but in this material world later on they prove false, similarly, suppose we catch hold of the lotus feet of Nityānanda, it may also prove false. But Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura assures that nitāiyer caraṇa satya: "It is not false. Because Nityānanda is eternal, His lotus feet is also eternal." Tāhāra sevaka nitya. And anyone who takes to the service of Nityānanda, they also become eternal.
Without being eternal, nobody can serve the eternal. That is the Vedic injunction. Without becoming Brahman, one cannot approach the Supreme Brahman. Just like without being fire, nobody can enter into the fire. Without being water, nobody can enter into the water. Similarly, without being fully spiritualized, nobody can enter into the spiritual kingdom. 
So nitāiyer caraṇa satya. If you catch the lotus feet of Nityānanda, then you become immediately spiritualized. Just like if you touch electricity, immediately you become electrified. That is natural. Similarly, Nityānanda is eternal happiness, if you touch Nityānanda some way or other, then you become also eternally happy. Tāhāra sevaka nitya. Therefore one who has in contact with Nityānanda, they have become eternal. Nitāiyer caraṇa satya, tāhāra sevaka nitya, dṛḍha kori' dharo nitāir pāy. So just catch Him very tightly.
Narottama boro duḥkhī, nitāi more koro sukhī. At the last Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, the composer of this song, he is appealing to Nityānanda, "My dear Lord, I am very unhappy. So You please make me happy. And You kindly keep me in corner of Your lotus feet." 
That is the sum and substance of this song.

[Anyone who has not established his relationship with Nityānanda Prabhu is understood to have spoiled his valuable human birth. Such a human being is actually an uncontrollable animal. Because he never uttered the holy name of Nityānanda, he has become merged into so-called material happiness. What can his useless education and family tradition do to help him?]

nitāiyer koruṇā habe, braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe

[Being maddened after false prestige and identification with the body, one is thinking, "Oh, what is Nityānanda? What can He do for me? I don't care." The result is that he is accepting something false to be truth. If you actually want to approach the association of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, you must first achieve the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. When He is merciful toward you, then you will be able to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Therefore you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda.]

[The lotus feet of Nityānanda are not illusion; they are a fact. One who engages in the transcendental loving service of Nityānanda is also transcendental. Always try to catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda. This Narottama dāsa is very unhappy, therefore I am praying to Lord Nityānanda to make me happy. My dear Lord, please keep me close to Your lotus feet.]

The meaning of this mantra, that I offer my humble obeisances to Lord Nṛsiṁha, who is the source of bliss to Prahlāda. But hiraṇyakaśipu vakṣaḥ, his father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, on his chest the nails of His finger is just like chisel cutting the stone. The same Personality of Godhead is prahlāda āhlāda-dāyine. Āhlāda means pleasure. 
For Prahlāda, prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa āhlāda, Prahlāda. A devotee is, being always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, naturally is in blissfulness. Still more when he meets or associates with his Lord, still more blissfulness. That is the position of the theist devotee. Whereas the atheist nondevotee, he is always feeling like a strike of the chisel, like, what do you call, stone-cutting chisel, nakha, nakhālaye, simply by the nails of His finger. 
All right. [end]

[O Keśava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of half-man, half-lion! All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between one’s fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasplike demon Hiraṇyakaśipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your beautiful lotus hands.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Nṛsiṁhadeva may save you. Lord Nṛsiṁha, prahlāda āhlāda-dāyine. And to the Hiraṇyakaśipu, śilā-ṭaṅka-nakhālaye. Both ways Kṛṣṇa is protecting. And Viṣṇu, you see He has got four hands. In two hands He's carrying śaṇkha, cakra, and in two hands gadā, padma. This śaṅkha and padma is for the devotee, and gadā and cakra for the demon. Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā, yadā yadā hi..., paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg 4.8]. 
[In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.]
He has got two business: to give protection to the devotee and to kill the demons. But the result is one. He does good to the demons by killing him, and He does good to the devotees by giving him protection.
So Nṛsiṁhadeva will give you protection in my absence. I am now going to Japan to get some books printed personally, and after that my program is to go to India. Maybe I shall be able to establish some temples there. Of course, in India there are many temples, but it does not mean that I shall not also establish some temples. Just like there is overpopulation, it does not mean that one should not beget child. Similarly, there may be many hundreds of thousand temples in India, still our this Society, ISKCON, should have their own temples. That is the way since time immemorial. There are hundreds and thousands of temples. 
So my advice to you: I am old man. So even I may not return, you shall continue this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This is eternal, and I shall request you to keep the standard as I have already given you the program: the Deity worship, the kīrtana, the street saṅkīrtana, distribution of literature, books. You should carry on this program with great enthusiasm. That is my request.
In the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness the first principle is enthusiasm. If you lack enthusiasm then other things will not happen. And you can keep enthusiastic if you follow the rules and regulation and chant regularly Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. Otherwise that enthusiasm also will dry. 
So six things are required for advancing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The first thing is enthusiasm. Utsāhān dhairyāt. And patient. And niścayād, with conviction, firm conviction. Utsāhān dhairyāt niścayād tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt [Upadeśāmṛta 3]:
[There are six principles favorable to the execution of pure devotional service: (1) being enthusiastic, (2) endeavoring with confidence, (3) being patient, (4) acting according to regulative principles [such as śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam [SB 7.5.23]—hearing, chanting and remembering Kṛṣṇa], (5) abandoning the association of nondevotees, and (6) following in the footsteps of the previous ācāryas. These six principles undoubtedly assure the complete success of pure devotional service.]
Following the rules and regulation, chalked-out plans. And sato vṛtteḥ, dealing very straightforward. No diplomacy, no politics, no duplicity. That will not help you. Sato vṛtteḥ. Vṛtteḥ, his profession, should be very straightforward. No underhand dealings. Sato vṛtteḥ and sādhu-saṅga [Cc Madhya 22.83], and in the association of devotees. 
[The root cause of devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa is association with advanced devotees. Even when one’s dormant love for Kṛṣṇa awakens, association with devotees is still most essential.]
Six things: enthusiasm, patience, firm conviction, following the rules and regulations, dealing straightforward, no duplicity, and in association of devotees. If you can keep these six principles always in front, then your progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is sure. There is no doubt about it. So as far as possible I've tried to train you, and you are doing nice. I'm satisfied. So keep the standard and go on. March forward, and Kṛṣṇa will bless you. 
Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [devotees offer obeisances] 
Chant. [end]

Nṛsiṁha Prayers & Purport 3
Prabhupāda: 
ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato nṛsiṁho
yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ

[Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva is here, and He is also there on the opposite side. Wherever I go, there I see Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. He is outside and within my heart. Therefore I take shelter of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead.]

[O Keśava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari who have assumed the form of a half-man, half-lion! All glories to You! With the wonderfully sharp nails on Your beautiful lotus hands You have ripped apart the wasplike body of Hiraṇyakaśipu.]

Pañca Tattva Mahā Mantra
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
prabhu-nityānanda
śrī-advaita gadādhara
śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda
[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, His incarnation Śrī Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Śrī Gadādhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Śrīvāsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are complete when we say, 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda 
śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
As preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting this Pañca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañca-tattva mantra, namely, 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda 
śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahā-mantra [Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare], we must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Pañca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. That will be very effective.

9th December, 1968, Los Angeles
Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Hare Kṛṣṇa. I was thinking of “Where is Jayānanda?” now immediately he has come. 
[someone brings some kind of offering and Śrīla Prabhupāda says to give it to his Guru Mahārāja] 
Ah. Thank you very much. Take care it may not fall down. All right.
Mmmm. So today is the disappearance day of my Guru Mahārāja. As I told you that sādhava jīva mā maro vā. There was a nice story the other day I told you that a sage is giving different kinds of blessings to different types of persons. So to a king’s son, a prince, he blessed, rāja-putra ciraṁ jīva: “Oh, you are king’s son, prince, you live forever.” And muni-putra, the son of a saintly person, he blessed him, mā jīva mā jīva: “You don’t live.” Rāja-putra ciraṁ jīva muni-putra mā jīva. And sādhu, devotees, he blessed him, jīva vā maro vā: “Either you live or you die, as you like.” And there was a butcher, he blessed him, mā jīva mā mara: “You don’t die, don’t live.” So these words are very significant. That I have already explained, still I am explaining. 
A prince, he’s enjoying sense, that’s all. He has got enough facility for sense enjoyment. So his next life is hellish. Because if you indulge in sex life, then Kṛṣṇa will give you facility to have sex life three times in an hour, just like the pigeons, the monkeys, the sparrows, they are very sexually strong. You have seen it. So the facility is given. So princely order, they are after sense enjoyment. So he’s blessed that “Better you live forever because after your death, you do not know what is going to happen to you, you are going to get a hellish life. Better you live for some time. Go on with your enjoyment.” And muni-putra mā jīva. Brahmacārī, working under the guidance, under strict disciplinary guidance of his spiritual master, he is blessed, mā jīva, “You better die. Because you are so trained to enter into the kingdom of God, so why should you take so much trouble? Better you die and go back to Godhead.” Mā jīva. And a devotee he blessed, jīva va maro va: “My dear devotee, either you live or die, the same thing.” And the butcher, he blessed him, ma jīva ma mara: “You don’t live, don’t die.” What he’s to do? His living condition is so abominable. From the morning, he has to slaughter so many animals, see the bloodstain, the ghastly scene. That is his livelihood. So what a horrible life this is. So “Don’t live. And don’t die also.” Because after death, oh, he is going to be in so much hellish condition, nobody can describe. So both life, living condition and death, after death, his condition is very horrible.
Anyway, apart from others, the devotee, for him, appearance and disappearance the same thing. Just like when my spiritual master appeared at Jagannātha Purī... He was the son of a very big government officer, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. He was magistrate, government officer. In those days a magistrate is a big officer in the government, practically next to governor. And Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was in charge of the Jagannātha temple. That is the system in Jagannātha Purī. The manager in charge of the temple is the district magistrate. So there was a Ratha-yātrā festival, and the car was passing in front of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s house. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s name was Kedaranath Datta. When he was magistrate, he was known as K.N. Datta. Kedaranath Datta. So the car stopped before his house, and at that time, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, a child in the lap of his mother. The mother took the opportunity of rising on the car. He [She] was magistrate’s wife, so he [she] had the facility. Immediately, people gave her way to go on the top of the car and place the child on the lotus feet of Jagannātha. And there were many garlands. One garland fell upon him, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, blessings. This was one of the... There were so many other things.
When he was a child two, three years old, he ate one mango fruit which was kept for offering to the Deity. So his father mildly rebuked him, “Oh, you have done very wrong thing. It was meant for Deity, and you have taken it. You should not have done it.” The child was two or three years old. He took it so seriously that never after that he took mango. Whenever we offered him mango he said, “No, I am offender. I cannot take mango.” He was thinking like that, you see. Never in his life he took a mango. He was thinking that “I offended in my childhood by taking the mango of the Deity.” This is the characteristic of ācārya. They teach by their life’s action that one should be so much determined, that one should not be... A child took the mango, there was no offense. But he took that vow.
Another instance, in my presence. At that time, we were also young men, and one of my Godbrothers, his name is Dr. Oul Bihari Kapoor... He’s now retired in Vṛndāvana, last time I saw him. He was also young man, and his wife was also young. So we were sitting together, talking with Guru Mahārāja, and the girl proposed, “My dear master, I want to speak with you.” So Guru Mahārāja said, “Yes, you can talk whatever you like.” So she said, “I want to talk with you secretly, not in the presence of everyone.” Guru Mahārāja said, “No, I cannot talk with you secretly. You can talk in the presence of my all other disciples.” So even that girl was just like his granddaughter by age calculation, he refused to talk with a young woman in a secret place. These are the instances.
So in his life he was akhaṇḍa brahmacārī. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura had many other sons, and he was the fifth son. And some of his other brother also, they did not marry. And my Guru Mahārāja, he also did not marry. From the childhood he is strict brahmacārī, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja. And he underwent very severe penances for starting this movement, worldwide movement. That was his mission. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura wanted do this. He, 1896, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura wanted to introduce this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by sending his this book, Shree Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, His Life and Precepts. Fortunately, that year was my birth year, and by Kṛṣṇa’s arrangement, we came in contact. I was born in a different family, my Guru Mahārāja was born in a different family. Who knew that I will come to his protection? Who knew that I would come in America? Who knew that you American boys will come to me? These are all Kṛṣṇa’s arrangement. We cannot understand how things are taking place. In 1936... Today is 9th December, 1938[68]. That means thirty-two years ago. In Bombay, I was then doing some business. All of a sudden, perhaps on this date, sometimes between 9 or 10 December. At that time, Guru Mahārāja was indisposed little, and he was staying at Jagannātha Purī, on the seashore. So I wrote him letter, “My dear master, your other disciples, brahmacārī, sannyāsī, they are rendering you direct service. And I am a householder. I cannot live with you, I cannot serve you nicely. So I do not know how can I serve you?” Simply an idea, I was thinking of serving him, “How can I serve him seriously?” 
So the reply was dated 13th December, 1936. In that letter he wrote, “My dear such and such, I am very glad to receive your letter. I think you should try to push our movement in English.” That was his writing. “And that will do good to you and to the people who will help you.” That was his instruction. And then in 1936, on the 31st December—that means just after writing this letter a fortnight before his departure—he passed away. But I took that order of my spiritual master very seriously. But I did not think that I’ll have to do such and such thing, I was at that time a householder. But this is the arrangement of Kṛṣṇa. If we strictly try to serve the spiritual master, his order, then Kṛṣṇa will give us all facilities. That is the secret. Although there was no possibility, I never thought, but I took it little seriously by studying a commentary by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura on the Bhagavad-gītā. In the Bhagavad-gītā, the verse vyavasāyātmikā-buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana. [Bg 2.41]
[Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.]
In connection with that verse, Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives his commentary that we should take up the words from the spiritual master as our life and soul. We should try to carry out the instruction, the specific instruction of the spiritual master, very rigidly, without caring for our personal benefit or loss.
So I tried a little bit in that spirit. So he has given me all facilities to serve him. Things have come to this stage, that in this old age I have come to your country, and you are also taking this movement seriously, trying to understand it. We have got some books now. So there is little foothold of this movement. Now on this occasion of my spiritual master’s departure, as I am trying to execute his will, similarly, I shall also request you to execute the same order through my will. I am an old man, I can also pass away at any moment. That is nature’s law. Nobody can check it. So that is not very astonishing. But my appeal to you on this auspicious day of the departure of my Guru Mahārāja, that at least to some extent you have understood the essence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. You should try to push it on. People are suffering for want of this consciousness. As we daily pray about devotees,
vāñchā-kalpatarubhyaś ca
kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca
patitānāṁ pāvanebhyo
vaiṣṇavebhyo namo namaḥ
[I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.]
A Vaiṣṇava, or devotee of Lord, his life is dedicated for the benefit of the people. You know—most of you belong to Christian community—how Lord Jesus Christ, he said that for your sinful activities he has sacrificed himself. That is the determination of devotee of the Lord. They don’t care for personal comforts. Because they love Kṛṣṇa or God, therefore they love all living entities because all living entities are in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. So similarly you should learn. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to become Vaiṣṇava and feel for the suffering humanity. But to feel for the suffering humanity, there are different angles of vision. Somebody is thinking of the suffering of the humanity from bodily conception of life. Somebody is trying to open hospital to give relief to the diseased condition. Somebody is trying to distribute foodstuff in poverty-stricken countries or places. 
These things are certainly very nice, but actual suffering of the humanity is due to lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These bodily sufferings, they are temporary, neither they can be checked by the laws of nature. Suppose if you give some distribution of foodstuff in some poverty-stricken country, that does not mean that this help makes solution of the whole problem. The real beneficial work is to invoke every person to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As soon as he comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness... The same example, as I have given several times, that a rich man’s son is loitering in the street, forgetting his father’s opulence and property. And somebody, out of sympathy, giving him some food. But other person comes to him and says, “Oh, my dear boy, I know you. You are the son of such and such rich man. Why you are loitering in the street? Come on, I shall take you to your father.” So if that gentleman takes that loitering boy to his father, the father is glad, and the boy inherits his father’s property, and his whole problem of life becomes solved. This is a crude example. Similarly, all living entities, they are loitering within this universe in different bodies, in different planets, and from time immemorial, without knowing that he belongs to the kingdom of God, he is the direct son of Kṛṣṇa and God, that Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of everything, and he can enjoy his father’s property, and these problems of material conditioned life automatically solved. Just like if you become a rich man, if you can possess millions of dollars, then your poverty is automatically solved. Similarly, if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, if you act in that way, then all other problems in the material conditional life—solved.
So this is such a nice movement. Ahaṁ tvaṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ [Bg 18.66]. 
[Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.]
The Bhagavad-gītā says, the Lord says, people’s sufferings are due to his sinful activities. Ignorance. Ignorance is the cause of sinful activity. Just like a man does not know. Suppose a foreigner like me comes in America and he does not know... Because in India... Just like in your country, the car is driven from the right side; in India, I’ve seen in London also, the car is driven from the left side. So suppose if he does not know, he drives the car on the left side and incurs some accident, and he is taken by the police custody. And if he says, “Sir, I did not know that here the car is driven from the right side,” that does not make him excused. The law will punish him. So ignorance is the cause of breaking the law, or sinful activities. And as soon as you commit some sinful activity, you have to suffer the result. So the whole world is in ignorance, and due to ignorance he’s complicated in so many actions and reactions, either good or bad. There is nothing good within this material world, everything is bad. So we have manufactured something good and something bad. Here... Because in the Bhagavad-gītā we understand this place is duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg 8.15]. 
[After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogīs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.]
This place is for misery. So how you can say, in miserable condition, how you can say that “This is good” or “This is bad.” Everything is bad. So those persons who do not know—the material, conditional life—they manufacture something, “This is good, this is bad,” because they do not know everything here is bad, nothing good. One should be very much pessimistic of this material world. Then he can make advance in spiritual life. Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam. This place is full of miseries, and if you study analytically you’ll find simply miserable condition. Therefore, the whole problem is that we should give up our material conditional life, and in Kṛṣṇa consciousness we should try to elevate ourself to the spiritual platform and thereby be promoted to the kingdom of Godhead, yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāmaṁ paramaṁ mama [Bg 15.6], where going, nobody comes back to this miserable world. And that is the supreme abode of the Lord.
[That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.]
So there are description in the Bhagavad-gītā. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is authorized, very important. Now, you American boys and girls who have taken to this movement, please take it more seriously and... That is the mission of Lord Caitanya and my Guru Mahārāja, and we are also trying to execute the will by disciplic succession. You have come forward to help me. I shall request you all that I shall go away, but you shall live. Don’t give up pushing on this movement, and you’ll be blessed by Lord Caitanya and His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Goswami Prabhupāda.
Thank you very much. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

’Rādhā-kṛṣṇa’ bolo bolo bolo re sobāi. This is a song sung by Ṭhākura Bhaktivinode. It is said that Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda, They are walking through the streets of the of Nadīyā town chanting this instruction, addressing everyone. They say, “You all people, please chant Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Hare Kṛṣṇa.” ’Rādhā-kṛṣṇa’ bolo bolo bolo re sobāi. “Every one of you, simply chant Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Hare Kṛṣṇa.” This is the instruction. Ei śikhā diyā. Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda, both together, while walking and dancing through the street, He was instructing that “All of you simply say Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.” Ei śikhā diyā, sab nadīyā, phirche [abhay?] gaura-nitāi. Phirche, phirche means walking. All over the town Nadīyā They were teaching this. Ei śikhā diyā, sab nadīyā, phirche [abhay?] gaura-nitāi. 
Then he says, [keno?] māyār bośe, jāccho bhese’, “Why you are being washed away on the waves of this māyā, material nescience?” Khāccho hābuḍubu, bhāi. “And whole day and night you are merged into full of anxieties, simply. Just like a man, when he is put into the water, sometimes drowning, sometimes coming up, but he is struggling very hard. Similarly, in the ocean of māyā, why you are so much struggling? Sometimes being drowned, sometimes coming up, sometimes feeling happiness, sometimes no happiness. Actually, there is no happiness. In the water, if you are put into the water, and if you are sometimes drowned and sometimes come out, that does not mean happiness. To come out for the temporary time, for the time being, and again being drowned up, that is not happiness.” 
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu is instructing that “Why you are troubling so much,” māyār bośe, “under the spell of māyā?” Then what is to be done? He says that jīv kṛṣṇa-dās, e viśvās, “Simply just believe it that you are servant of God, you are servant of Kṛṣṇa.” Jīv kṛṣṇa-dās, e viśvās, korle to’ ār duḥkha nāi: “As soon as you come to this point that you are servant of God or servant of Kṛṣṇa, immediately all your troubles become ceased. There is no more trouble.” 
So this instruction is given by Lord Caitanya walking over the streets. Jīv kṛṣṇa-dās, e viśvās, korle to’ ār duḥkha nāi. Then Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura gives his own personal experience. He says, jay sakal vipod, “I become released from all kinds of dangers.” Gāi bhaktivinod. Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura, he is ācārya, he is experienced, he says that “Whenever I chant Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Hare Kṛṣṇa, I become freed from all kinds of dangers.” 
Jay sakal vipod. Jakhon ami o-nām gāi, “Whenever I chant this Holy Name, Hare Kṛṣṇa or Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, immediately all my dangers are over.” ’Rādhā-kṛṣṇa’ bolo, saṅge calo. So Lord Caitanya therefore says that “I am walking on the street and begging from you. What is that begging? That you simply chant. This is my request, begging.” ’Rādhā-kṛṣṇa’ bolo, saṅge calo. “And just follow Me.” ’Rādhā-kṛṣṇa’ bolo, saṅge calo, ei-mātra bhikṣā cāi, “I am simply asking you for this contribution, that you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and follow Me so that your struggle for existence in this material ocean will cease.”

[Anyone who takes pleasure sporting within the waves of the ocean of Lord Caitanya's distribution of love of God immediately becomes a confidential devotee of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava.

If he is actually taking part in Lord Caitanya's saṅkīrtana activities and actually understanding what it is, then such a person is always liberated. Narottama dāsa aspires for his association.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Gaurāṅgera duṭi pada, yāra dhana sampada, sei jāne bhakati-rasa-sāra. This is another song composed by Narottama das Ṭhākura, and he says that "One who has accepted the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya, in other words, one who has the only asset of possession, the two feet of Lord Caitanya, such person is supposed to know what is the essence of devotional service." 
Sei jāne bhakati-rasa-sāra. What is the purport of devotional service, or what is the humor of devotional service, can be understood by a person who has accepted Lord Caitanya's lotus feet as everything. The idea is that actually Lord Caitanya, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and He is teaching devotional service to the living entities personally, directly. Therefore the modes of devotional service, as taught by Lord Caitanya, is the most perfect. There cannot be any doubt. 
The expert, or the master, is teaching the servant how to work. If somebody is master of some engineering work and he is personally teaching some assistant, that teaching, instruction, is most perfect. Similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, in the role of a devotee, is teaching devotional service. Therefore the path chalked out by Lord Kṛṣṇa is the most feasible way for perfection to devotional service. Sei jāne bhakati rasa sāra. Sāra means essence.
And then he says, gaurāṅgera madhuri-līlā, yāra karṇe praveśilā. Now he comes to the pastimes of Lord Caitanya. He says that "Lord Caitanya's pastimes are also as much transcendental as Lord Kṛṣṇa's." As in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that anyone who can simply understand the transcendental appearance, disappearance, activities, work of Kṛṣṇa, he immediately becomes eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. Simply by understanding the pastimes and the work, transcendental activities of Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, one who enters into the pastimes of Lord Caitanya, he immediately becomes freed from all contamination of the heart. Gaurāṅgera madhuri-līlā, yāra karṇe praveśilā. Karṇe praveśilā means simply one has to receive the message of Lord Caitanya. Karṇe means in the ear. To give the message a submissive aural reception. Then immediately one's heart becomes freed from all material contamination.
Then he says: yei gaurāṅgera nāma laya, tāra haya premodaya. The devotees are concerned how to develop love of Godhead. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura recommends that anyone who simply chants śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda...'' Gaurāṅga means with all this paraphernalia. As soon as we speak of gaurāṅga, we should mean the five: Lord Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara, and Śrīvāsa. All together. So yei gaurāṅgera nāma laya, anyone who chants, immediately he will develop love of Godhead. Yei gaurāṅgera nāma laya, tara haya premodaya, tāre mui jaya bole hari. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says "I offer him all congratulations.'' Because it is certain that he has developed love of Godhead. Then he says, gaurāṅga-guṇete jhure, nitya-līlā tāre sphure. Anyone, if he cries by simply by hearing the transcendental qualities of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he at once understands what is the loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.
Nitya-līlā means the pastimes, or the loving exchange, affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, that is eternal. That is not temporary. We should not think that Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa pastimes, loving affairs, is just like the business of a young boy or girl, as we see in this material world. Such loving affairs is not at all loving affairs. They are lusty affairs, and they are not eternal. Therefore they break. Today I am in love with somebody and next day it breaks. But Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa līlā is not like that. It is eternal. Therefore that is transcendental and this is temporary. So simply one who is absorbed in the pastimes of Lord Caitanya, he can immediately understand what is the actual position of the loving affairs of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Nitya-līlā tāre sphure. Sei yaya rādhā-mādhava, sei yaya vrajendra-suta pāśa. And simply by doing that, he becomes eligible to enter into the abode of Kṛṣṇa. Vrajendra-suta. Vrajendra-suta means the son of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana. He's sure to go to associate with Kṛṣṇa in his next birth.
Gaurāṅgera saṅge-gaṇe, nitya-siddha boli māne. Anyone who has understood that the associates of Lord Caitanya, they are not ordinary conditioned souls... They are liberated souls. Nitya-siddha bole māni. There are three kinds of devotees. One is called sādhana-siddha. Sadhana-siddha means by following the regulative principles of devotional service, if one becomes perfect, he's called sādhana-siddha. Another devotee is called kṛpā-siddha. Kṛpā-siddha means even if he has not followed strictly all the regulative principle, still, by the mercy of ācārya or a devotee, or by Kṛṣṇa, he is elevated to the perfectional stage. That is special. And another devotee is called nitya-siddha. Nitya-siddha means they were never contaminated. The sādhana-siddha and kṛpā-siddha was contaminated by material touch, and by following regulative principles or by the mercy or grace of some devotee and ācārya they're elevated to the perfectional state. But nitya-siddha means they were never contaminated. They're ever liberated. So all the associates of Lord Caitanya, just like Advaita Prabhu, Śrīvāsa, Gadādhara, Nityānanda, they are Viṣṇu-tattva. They are all liberated. Not only they, the Gosvāmīs... There are many others. So they are ever-liberated. So one who can understand that the associates of Lord Caitanya are ever-liberated... Nitya-siddha bale māni, sei yaya vrajendra suta-pāśa. Immediately he becomes eligible to enter into the abode of Kṛṣṇa.
And then he says, gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, yebā jāni cintāmaṇi. The gauḍa-maṇḍala means the place in West Bengal wherein Lord Caitanya had His pastimes. In Navadvīpa, during Lord Caitanya's birth anniversary, the devotees go and circumambulate different places of Lord Caitanya's pastimes. It takes nine days. So that portion of Bengal is called gauḍa-maṇḍala. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, "One who understands that there is no difference between this part of the country with Vṛndāvana," tāra haya vraja-bhūmi vāsa, "it is as good as one lives in Vṛndāvana." Then he says, gaura-prema rasārṇarve. Lord Caitanya's activities is just like an ocean of loving affairs of Kṛṣṇa. 
Therefore one who takes a dip into this ocean, gaura-prema-rasārṇave, sei taraṅga yebā ḍube. Just like we take a dip and bath, and we play, sport, in the waves of the ocean or sea. Similarly, one who takes pleasure, taking a dip and sporting with the waves of the ocean of Lord Caitanya's distribution of love of God, such a person becomes immediately a confidential devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Sei rādhā-mādhava-antaraṅga. Antaraṅga means not ordinary devotee. They are confidential devotee. And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, gṛhe vā vanete thāke. "Such devotee, who is taking pleasure in the waves of Lord Caitanya's movement," because he has become a very confidential devotee of the Lord...
Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, "Such devotee, it doesn't matter whether he's in the renounced order of life or whether he is a householder." Gṛha. Gṛha means householder. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement does not say that one has to become a renounced order, sannyāsī. Just like Māyāvādī sannyāsīs, impersonalists, Śaṅkarācārya, they first, they put the first condition that "You take up the renounced order of life first, and then talk of spiritual advancement." So in Śaṅkara sampradāya nobody is accepted as bona fide impersonalist unless he has accepted the renounced order of life. But here, in Caitanya's movement, there is no such restriction. 
Advaita Prabhu, He was a householder. Nityānanda, He was householder. Gadādhara, He was also householder. And Śrīvāsa, he was also householder. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu also married twice. So it doesn't matter. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that to become in renounced order of life, or to remain in householder life, that does not matter. If he is actually taking part in the movements of Caitanya's saṅkīrtana activities and actually understanding what it is, he is taking sport in the waves of such devotional ocean, then such person is always liberated. And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is aspiring his association ever increasingly. That is the sum and substance of this song.

			Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

The materialistic demeanor cannot possibly stretch to the transcendental autocrat who is ever inviting the fallen conditioned soul to associate with Him through devotion or eternal serving mood. The phenomenal attractions are often found to tempt sentient being to enjoy the variegated position which is opposed to undifferenced monism. 
People are so much apt to indulge in transitory speculation even when they are to educate themselves on the situation beyond their empiric area or experiencing jurisdiction and almost foolishly they dare to declare that God is dead. The songs of Brahma-saṁhitā as cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu, will surely help such souls in their march toward the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual kingdom which is lying beyond their sensuous gaze of inspection.
The so-called astronomers cannot even definitely give us information of the visible sky which is overflooded with sunlight during daytime and moonlight at night. We can, however, learn about spiritual kingdom from the Bhagavad-gītā that it is situated far, far beyond the visible sky and in that sky there is no need of sunlight or moonlight or even electricity. 
There are innumerable spiritual planets in that self-effulgent sky and the gross estimate of that sky is given in the Bhagavad-gītā that the material world wherein there are innumerable suns and moons is only one-fourth of the whole kingdom of God. This material world is also part of the kingdom of God, but this kingdom of God is described as made of inferior energy on account of its temporary nature and is compared with a mass of clouds in the sky. 
When there is a mass of clouds in the sky there is certainly torrents of rain and there is a type of creation of new vegetation on account of such rainfall. But in spite of all such variegatedness, manifestation of greenery scene, of fruits and flowers, the whole show is only temporary. When the season is over, everything fades away into different situations and the temporary manifestation comes to an end.
Therefore the material world is called three phases of existence, namely creation, sustenance, and dissolution at last. This creation and dissolution is going on perpetually like seasonal changes and the portion of the vast sky where such temporary variegatedness is taking place and again becoming out of sight, is called the material world. 
And beyond this material manifestation of variegatedness, there is the world of spiritual sky where everything is eternal, full of life, blissful and knowledge distinct from the non-eternal, miserable existence of ignorance. In the material world everything is struggling hard for existence but the cruel laws of material nature will not allow anybody to exist although everyone of us aspires to exist eternally in full blissful life of perfect knowledge.
This information is available in the Brahma-saṁhitā that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa, and His transcendental form is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. In the spiritual world, not only Kṛṣṇa has His eternal body full of bliss and knowledge, but also everyone who associates with Kṛṣṇa has the same spiritual nature. In the abode of Kṛṣṇa which is called Cintāmaṇi-dhāma [Bs 5.29], the land, the trees, the animals, the residents, everything is of the same spiritual nature as that of Kṛṣṇa. 
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakṣmīs or gopīs.]
This spiritual nature is expansion of interior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa is called the cause of all causes.
It is said that Brahmā, who wrote Brahma-saṁhitā after his mature knowledge by meditation, it was revealed in him that by the recollection of bhakti-yoga, it appeared to him that he is the eternal maid-servant of Kṛṣṇa. Though other mysteries in regard to the condition of the maid-servant of Kṛṣṇa were not revealed to him, Brahmā by dint of his searching self-consciousness became well acquainted with the ocean of truth. 
All the truths of the Vedas were revealed to him and with the help of those essence of the Vedas, he offered this hymn to the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrīman Mahāprabhu, Lord Caitanya has taught this hymn to His favorite disciples in as much as it fully contains all the transcendental truths regarding Vaiṣṇava philosophy. The audience, the hearers of this record are requested to study and try to enter into the spirit of this hymn with great care and attention as a regular daily function.
The first verse is translated: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, fulfilling all desires, in the abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakṣmīs, or gopīs. By the word cintāmaṇi is meant transcendental gem. Just as māyā builds the mundane universe with the five material elements, so the spiritual cit potency has built the spiritual world of transcendental gems. 
The cintāmaṇi which serves as material in the building of the above Supreme Lord's place, Goloka, is a far rarer and more agreeable entity than the philosopher's stone. The purpose tree only, the fruits of piety, wealth, fulfillment of desires and liberation but the purpose trees in the abode of Kṛṣṇa bestows innumerable fruits yielding the fulfillment of desire or oceans of milk in the shape of the fourteen love-showering transcendental bliss that take away with the hunger and thirst of all pure devotees. The trees in the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa can supply anything desired by the devotees. 
The devotees residing in the abode of Kṛṣṇa have not desired to fulfill. Still, there are variegated transcendental desires of the devotees to satisfy their eternal Lord in loving service. In the material world a tree can supply only the fruits that it can produce but in the spiritual world any tree can supply any amount of fruits or any variety of fruits to the aspirant devotee.
The second verse is translated: "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept on playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals, with head bedecked with peacock feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of gopīs." The matchless beauty of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, or Govinda is being described. Kṛṣṇa, the all-pervading cognisant has the spiritual form of youth. 
The form of Kṛṣṇa is not a fanciful creation of imagination formed after visualizing the beautiful things of the world like the poet or the artist. When Brahmā saw in his ecstasy trance of pure devotion, He is being described. Kṛṣṇa is engaged in playing upon His flute, that attracts the hearts of all living beings. Just as a lotus petal produces a pleasant sight, so the two beautiful eyes of Kṛṣṇa, who causes the manifestation of our spiritual vision, display the unlimited splendor and beauty of His moon-like face. 
The loveliness that adorns His head with peacock feather is gorgeous. The surrounding feature of the spiritual beauty of Kṛṣṇa, just as a mass of blue clouds offer a specifically soothing pleasant view, the complexion of Kṛṣṇa is analogously tinged with a spiritual dark blue color. The beauty and loveliness of Kṛṣṇa is far more enchanting than that of Cupid multiplied a million-fold.
The next verse is translated: "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, around whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with flute and jeweled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of Śyāmasundara is eternally manifested." 
In the śloka beginning with cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu, the transcendental region and the spiritual names of Govinda in the śloka beginning with govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi, the eternal beautiful form of Govinda, and in this śloka the amorous pastimes of Govinda, praṇaya-keli, means the amorous pastimes of Govinda, the embodiment of sixty-four excellences have been described. 
All the spiritual affairs have come within this scope of description and the narration of the ecstatic mellow qualities, rasa, are included in the spiritual amorous order of Govinda. Lord Kṛṣṇa, Govinda is always visible with His eternal consort, Rādhārāṇī. This conjugal living pair is called by Narottama Dāsa Ṭhākura as yugala-pīriti. Yugala-pīriti means conjugal love. The conjugal love is existing originally in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and that is reflected only in the material world in a perverted form.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This verse is particularly important, because it describes the significance of sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs 5.1]. 
[Kṛṣṇa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.]
The Lord's body is sac-cid-ānanda. His body is not like ours. Our body is acit and..., asat, acit and nirānanda, just the opposite. Asat means it will not exist, and acit means it is full of ignorance, and nirānanda... Nirānanda means full of miseries. These three qualification of our body, whereas the Lord's body is sac-cid-ānanda: it is eternal and full of knowledge and full of bliss. 
Our body and with our self... My body and my self are different. But Lord and Lord's body is absolute. What is Lord, Lord's body is also the same. So that description is given here: aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti. The Lord is not impersonal. He has got His form. And what sort of form? We should not consider that whenever there is a question of form, the form must be just like one of us. This is foolishness. Now, His form is completely different, just like we have explained. His form is sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha, and our this present material body is asat, acit and nirānanda. Just completely different. 
So His form, His different parts of the body, described in the Vedas, apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā paśyati... [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 3.19]: 
[The Supreme Lord has no material hands and feet but accepts whatever is offered to Him and moves very quickly. The Supreme Person has no material ears and eyes but sees and hears everything. He is the knower of everything, and He is all that is to be known. It is said that He is the best and the greatest of all persons.]
"He has no hands and legs; still, He accepts all that you offer to Him.'' In the Bhagavad-gītā also we'll find that,
patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam
aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ
 [Bg 9.26]
[If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.]
"My devotees..." God is not... The Lord is not in need of our offering, but still, He is so kind, if we offer Him something... Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam. Not that we have to offer him very luxurious things, very highly valuable things. He says that even a piece of leaf, patraṁ, a piece of flower, patraṁ puṣpam, a piece of fruit and little water... That means these four things can be secured by any poor man in any part of the world. There is no botheration for securing a piece of leaf, a piece of flower a little water or a piece of fruit. Any poor man, any rich man can secure. 
And the Lord says, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [Bg 9.26]: 
"Anyone who offers Me these four things with devotion, with love, I accept them." "I accept them." Why? Now, tad ahaṁ bhaktyā upahṛtam aśnāmi: "Because that is secured with sincere love for Me." So God..., the Lord accepts our love.
Now, the Lord is... We cannot see. He is far, far away, and still, He is within us. Therefore His hand is not like our hands. The Vedas... When the Vedas describes, "The Lord has no hand," that means He has no hand like ours, not that a two-feet hand which we have got, or two- or three-feet hand; largest hand. His hand is so large that He can extend His hand in any part of His creation, millions and billions miles away, and everywhere. That is the specific significance of His body. So this is described here. [sings:]
aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti
paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti
ānanda-cinmaya-sadujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
 [Bs 5.32]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth, substantiality and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane.]
And another special significance of the parts of His body, limbs or hands or legs, eyes, ears... What is that significance? Now, each part of His body has got all the potency of other parts of the body. Just like with our eyes we can simply see; but the Lord, He can not only see by His eyes, transcendental eyes, but He can also hear, He can also eat. All the... All the functions of all other parts of the body, He can function by any part of His body. Not that a particular part of the body can function only for a particular purpose. No. 
Just like simply by glancing... In the Vedic literature it is said, sa aikṣata sa asṛjata: "Simply by seeing—simply by seeing—He impregnated all the energies for creation. Simply by seeing." Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg 9.10]. 
[This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.]
Simply by His glance. Simply by His glance He impregnates the material energy for functioning. It is going on.
So He has got all the potencies in all the parts of His body. Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti paśyanti pānti kalayanti. That is the difference between His body and our body. So when there is description in the Vedas that "He has no leg, no hand, no eyes," that does not mean He has no eyes. He has got eyes, but not these eyes just like we have got conception. So here it is explained that aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti. His parts of the body are invested with all the potencies of other parts of the body. With any part of His body He can function any work.

All the universes exist in Him and He is present in His fullness in every one of the atoms that are scattered throughout the universe, at one and the same time. Such is the primeval Lord whom I adore.]

 [Bs 5.38]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Śyāmasundara, Kṛṣṇa Himself with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti [Bs 5.38]. Now, people say that "Whether God can be seen? If anyone has seen God?" Yes, God can be seen. There is no doubt about it. But it requires some qualification. Not some, but only one qualification. God is so kind that He does not require any material qualification. He does not require that you should be very learned man, very beautiful, or very rich man, or a king or emperor or minister or president, no, nothing of the sort. You can be anything. But only one qualification required. Then you can see God. What is that qualification? 
[sings:] Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti. That qualification is unalloyed love. That's all. 
One who has achieved that unalloyed..., unalloyed love for God... Unalloyed love means without any tinge of philosophical speculation or fruitive activities. That's another subject; it requires great explanation. But unalloyed love means without any tinge of material color. That is called unalloyed. Even philosophical speculation or fruitive activities, even if it is offered to the Supreme Lord, that is not love. Love is above this. So if one can achieve that unalloyed love for God, with that, I mean to say, magic wand, the eyes become eligible for seeing God. Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena. And that, that eye, is called devotional eye. Devotional. 
We have to... Not only eyes, but every part of our body, we have to spiritualize by the contact. By the contact of spiritual service in devotion of the Lord, we can gradually spiritualize our whole set of senses. Just like a iron rod given to the fire: gradually the temperature rises. It becomes warm, warmer, warmest, very hot, then red hot. When it is red hot, then it is no longer iron; it is fire. Similarly, by our contact in devotional service of the Lord we can change the whole position of our material existence. And we have... If we have developed to that stage of unalloyed love for God, then God can be seen twenty-four hours, not that once seen and again not seen. No. 
This is described here, that santaḥ, the great devotees, unalloyed devotees, who are liberated souls, have no connection with material activities or philosophical speculation, such unalloyed devotees, because their eyes are smeared with the ointment of love only, therefore they can see the Lord sadaiva, always, twenty-four hour.

Orchestral arrangements on Govinda: 	John Barham
All titles traditionally arranged:  	Mukunda Goswami

Rādhā Kṛṣṇa Temple, London
Originally Recorded at 
Apple Studios in London, 
England, 1970

In 1966 Śrīla Prabhupada with a handful of followers, registered the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness at his humble storefront temple in New Yorks's lower east side, By 1969 the Hare Kṛṣṇa Mantra had spread throughout the West, and with help of George Harrison and the Beatles, the recording of the mantra on this album reached the top ten in record charts throughout the world. The Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees were featured three times on the BBC show, "Top of the Tops", and the lead song "Govinda" also appeared on the charts at the same time. The Hare Kṛṣṇa chant had become a household word in Britain and in many other countries throughout the world.
George played harmonium and dubbed in lead and bass guitar on "The Hare Kṛṣṇa Mantra" song, and the lead guitar opening on "Govinda". The devotees played all kinds of instruments: Tamala Kṛṣṇa Goswami played the flute, Harivilasa played the oud, Jivananda and Lilavati sang on Śrī Isopanisad and other songs and Yamuna sang on Govinda and Bhaja Hure Mana. The studio engineers and staff were very enthusiastic and everyone joined in spontaneously for the chorus of "The Hare Kṛṣṇa Mantra". This recording is a milestone in the history of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the West.

[Lowest of all is located Devī-dhāma [mundane world], next above it is Maheśa-dāma [abode of Maheśa]; above Maheśa-dhāma is placed Hari-dhāma [abode of Hari] and above them all is located Kṛṣṇa's own realm named Goloka.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Pralaya-payodhi-jale-dhṛtavān asi vedam, vihita-vahitra-caritram akhedam. Today is the incarnation day of Lord Kṛṣṇa's appearing as the Boar. He lifted the world when it was submerged within the water of Garbhodakśa, Garbhodaka Ocean. The universe which we are seeing, it is only half. The other half is filled with water, and in that water is Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu lying. 
So one demon, Hiraṇyākṣa, he pushed this earthly planet within that water, and Lord Kṛṣṇa delivered this earthly planet from water in the shape of a boar. So that auspicious day is today, Varāha-dvadaśī. This is called Varāha-dvadasi. So on this day it is better to sing, to glorify the different incarnations of Lord within this universe. The first incarnation is the fish form.
So these prayers were offered by Jayadeva Gosvāmī. One Vaiṣṇava poet advented about seven hundred years before Lord Caitanya’s appearance. He was a great devotee, and his specific poetry, Gīta-govinda, is very famous all over the world. Gīta-govinda. Gīta-govinda is the subject matter of Kṛṣṇa playing on flute about Rādhārāṇī. That is the subject matter of Gīta-govinda. 
The same poet, Jayadeva Gosvāmī, has offered this prayer, pralaya-payodhi-jale-dhṛtavān asi vedam. He says, “My dear Lord, when there was devastation within this universe, everything was filled with water. At that time You saved the Vedas stacked in a boat, and You held the boat from being drowned in the water, in the shape of a big fish.” This fish first of all was caught in the waterpot just like a small fish. Then it enlarged, and the fish was kept in a bigger water reservoir. In this way, the fish was increasing. Then the fish informed that “Devastation is coming. You just save all the Vedas on a boat, and I shall protect it.” Jayadeva Gosvāmī is offering prayer, “My Lord, You saved the Vedas when there was devastation in the shape of fish.”
The next is Kūrmāvatāra. There was churning of the ocean. One side all the demigods and one side all the demons, and the churning rod was a great hill called Mandara-pārvata. And the resting place was on the back of the Lord appeared as a tortoise. So he’s offering his prayer that “You appeared as a tortoise just to become the resting place. And this happened because You were feeling some itching sensation on Your back. So You accepted this big rod, Mandara Hill, to itch, as the itching instrument.”
Then the next incarnation is this Varāha, boar or hog. He delivered this earthly planet by the tusk, and He kept the whole world on His tusk. We can just imagine how big He appeared. And the world at that time appeared just like the moon disc with some marks on it. So keśava dhṛta-varāha-śarīra. He says, “My dear Lord, You have appeared as the great boar. So let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.”
Fourth incarnation is Nṛsiṁhadeva. Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared to save Prahlāda Mahārāja, who was five-years-old boy and he was being tortured by his atheistic father. So He appeared from the pillar of the palace as a half-man, half-lion. Because this Hiraṇyakaśipu took benediction from Brahmā that he’ll not be killed by any man or any animal. So the Lord appeared neither man nor animal. This is the difference between the Lord’s intelligence and our intelligence. We are thinking that we can cheat the Lord by our intelligence, but the Lord is more intelligent than us. This Hiraṇyakaśipu wanted to cheat Brahmā by indirect definition. First of all he wanted to become immortal. Brahmā said, “That is not possible because even I am not immortal. Nobody in this material world is immortal. That is not possible.” So Hiraṇyakaśipu, the demon... The demons are very intelligent. He thought that “Round about way I shall become immortal.” He prayed to Brahmā that “Please give me the benediction that I shall not be killed by any man or any animal.” Brahmā said, “Yes, that is all right.” “I shall not be killed in the sky, on the water or on land.” Brahmā said, “Oh, all right.” “I shall not be killed by any man-made weapons.” “That’s all right.” 
In this way, he utilized his intelligence in so many ways just to come to the conclusion of being immortal. But the Lord is so cunning that He kept intact all the benediction given by Brahmā, still he was killed. He said that “I’ll not be killed either during daytime or night.” Brahmā said “Yes.” So he was killed just in the evening, just in the junction of day and night. You cannot say it is day or night. He took the benediction that “I shall not be killed in the sky, on the water, on the land.” So he was killed on His lap. He took the benediction that “I shall not be killed by any man-made or any God-made weapons.” That was given, “All right.” So he was killed by the nails. 
In this way, all the benedictions were kept intact, still he was killed. Similarly, we may make plan, we may make very advancement in scientific knowledge, but the killing process of nature will be there. Nobody can escape. By our intelligence we cannot escape. The four principles of material existence means birth, death, old age and disease. We can manufacture many medicines, many weapons, many means, many methods, but you cannot escape these four principles of material existence, however great you may be. That was proved by Hiraṇyakaśipu. Hiraṇyakaśipu was one of the stalwart materialistic and he wanted to live forever, enjoy, but he also could not live. Everything was finished.
Then next incarnation is Vāmana, the dwarf. Lord Vāmana appeared before Bali Mahārāja. That was also another cheating. Bali Mahārāja conquered all the universal planets, and the demigods were too much disturbed. So Vāmana Mahārāja... Vāmanadeva went to Bali Mahārāja that “You give me some alms. I am brāhmaṇa. I have come to beg from you.” So Bali Mahārāja said, “Yes. I’ll give You.” So He wanted three feet land only. So by one feet the whole universe was covered, upside, and another feet the other half was covered. Then the third feet Bali Mahārāja said, “Yes, now there is no place. Please keep Your feet on my head. Still my head is there.” So Vāmanadeva was very much pleased by the sacrifice of Bali Mahārāja. He gave up everything for the Lord. So he is one of the great authorities. Out of the twelve authorities, Bali Mahārāja is one of the authorities because he sacrificed everything to satisfy the Lord.
Next is Paraśurāma. Paraśurāma, twenty-one times He made a massacre propaganda for killing all the kṣatriya kings. The kṣatriya kings were very much dishonest at that time, so he killed them for twenty-one times. They fled from here and there. And from the history of Mahābhārata it is understood, at that time some of the kṣatriyas fled and took shelter in the European side. And the Indo-European stock is from those kṣatriyas. That is history, historical information from Mahābhārata.
Then next incarnation is Lord Rāma. So He fought with Rāvaṇa, who had ten heads. So... And the next incarnation is Balarāma. Balarāma is the elder brother of Kṛṣṇa. He is incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa, next expansion of Kṛṣṇa. So He was very white in complexion, and He was wearing blue garments, and with His plow He was...sometimes He was angry with Yamunā River, and He tried to dry up the Yamunā River. That description is given here. And Yamunā, out of His fear, she agreed to the proposal of Balarāma.
And the next incarnation is Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha, He decried the Vedic principles. Therefore, He is calculated as atheist. Anyone who does not agree with the Vedic principles, he is considered as atheist. Just like one who does not believe in the Bible, they are called heathens; similarly, those who do not accept the Vedic principles, they are called atheists. So Lord Buddha, although incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, He said that “I do not believe in Vedas.” What was the reason? The reason was to save the poor animals. 
At that time, people were sacrificing the poor animals under the plea of Vedic sacrifice. So demonic persons, they want to do something under the protection of authority. Just like a big lawyer takes the protection of the lawbook and he makes the law unlawful. Similarly, the demons are so intelligent that they take advantage of scriptural injunction and do all nonsense. So these things were going on. In the name of Vedic sacrifice, they were killing animals like anything. So Lord became very much compassionate to these poor animals and He appeared as Lord Buddha, and His philosophy was nonviolence. His philosophy was atheist because He said that, 
“There is no God. This combination of matter is a manifestation, and you dismantle the material elements, there will be void and there will be no sense of pleasure and pain. That is the nirvāṇa, ultimate goal of life.” That was His philosophy. But actually His mission was to stop animal killing, to stop the men from so much sinful activities. So Lord Buddha is also prayed herewith. So people will be surprised that Lord Buddha is designated as atheist and still the Vaiṣṇavas, they are offering their respectful prayers to Lord Viṣṇu [Buddha]. Why? Because the Vaiṣṇava knows how the God is acting for His different purposes. Others, they do not know.
The next avatār incarnation is Kalki. That is yet to take place. Kalki avatāra will appear at the end of this age, Kali-yuga. The Age of Kali-yuga, duration of this age is still to be, I mean to say, fulfilled in 400,000’s of years. So at the end of Kali, that means at the last stage, after about 400,000’s of years, the incarnation of Kalki will appear. That is predicted in the Vedic literatures, as Lord Buddha’s appearance was also predicted in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. And Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam was compiled five thousand years ago, and Lord Buddha appeared about 2,500 years ago. 
Therefore, about Lord Buddha’s appearance it is predicted that at the beginning of Kali-yuga Lord Buddha will appear. There was prediction, and that has actually come to be true. Similarly, there is prediction about Kalki avatāra, and that will also come to be true. So at that time, Lord Kalki’s business will be simply to kill. No instruction. Just like in Bhagavad-gītā, Lord Kṛṣṇa gave instruction in the shape of Bhagavad-gītā. But at the end of Kali-yuga, people will be so much degraded that there is no more possibility to give any instruction. They will not be able to understand even. 
At that time the only weapon will be to kill them. And one who is killed by the Lord, he also gets salvation. That is God’s all-merciful quality. Either He protects or He kills, the result is the same. So that will be the last stage of this Kali-yuga, and after that, again Satya-yuga, the age of religiosity, will begin. These are the statements of Vedic literature. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Pralaya-payodhi-jale dhṛtavān asi vedam. This is a song sung by great Vaiṣṇava poet Jayadeva Gosvāmī. The purport is that when there was devastation, the whole universe was flooded with water. The ultimate dissolution of this material world will be, first of all, there will be no water, all water on the earth will be dried up by scorching heat of the sun. The sun will become twelve times stronger as it is at the present moment. In that way, evaporate all the waters, the seas and the oceans will be all evaporate. 
Therefore all living creatures on the Earth will die, and then, due to scorching heat, practically everything will be turned into ashes. Then there will be rain for a hundred years, torrents of rain, like the trunk of the elephant, and thus the whole universe will be filled with water. That is called pralaya-payodhi. At the time of devastation, pralaya, the whole universe will be just like it is now filled with air, at that time it will be filled up with water.
So at that time Vedas will be saved by the Lord on a boat, and the boat will be stuck up in the wings of the great fish. That great fish is the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he is worshiping, keśava dhṛta-mīna-śarīra jaya jagadīśa. So mīna-śarīra. The next is kṣitir iha vipulatare tiṣṭhati tava pṛṣṭhe dharaṇi-dharaṇa-kiṇa-cakra-gariṣṭhe. So there will be churning, next incarnation is tortoise. On the back of the tortoise the meru-parvata will be fixed up, or the world will rest on the back of the tortoise. This is second incarnation. First fish, and then tortoise.
Then varāha-avatāra. One demon, Hiraṇya, Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa. So he'll, by his demonic activities will throw the Earth on the Garbho Sea. There is a sea within this universe. Half of the globe is filled up with Garbhosamudra, on which Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is there, and from Him a lotus stem comes out wherein Brahmā takes birth. So all the planets are hanging as different stems of this original stem coming out from the abdomen of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. So one demon of the name Hiraṇyākṣa, he will put this Earth within this water, and at that time, the Lord will come out in the incarnation of Varāha. The Varāha incarnation came as a small insect from the nose of Brahmā, and when he put it on his hand, He began to increase. In this way He assumed a very gigantic body, and with His tusk, He picked up the Earth from within the water of Garbho ocean. That is called keśava-dhṛta-varāha-rūpa.
The next is tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-sṛṅgaṁ dalita-hiraṇyakaśipu-tanu-bhṛṅgam. Hiraṇyakaśipu, he was another demon who wanted to be immortal. So he took benediction from Brahmā that he'll not die on land, in the sky or in the water. So, in order to keep as it is, the benediction given by Brahmā, Lord Kṛṣṇa tries to honor the words of His devotee. So Brahmā gave him benediction, "Yes, you will not die on land, on water, in sky.'' But Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared as half-lion, half-man, because Hiraṇyakaśipu also took benediction from Brahmā that he'll not be killed by any man or any animal. 
So He assumed the form of something which you cannot say a man or animal, and He put the demon on His lap, which is neither land, water or sky. And he wanted to, not to be killed by any weapons. Therefore the Lord killed Him with His nails. Nail is not considered as weapon. In this way, he wanted to cheat Brahmā, but the Lord is so intelligent that He cheated Hiraṇyakaśipu, and killed him. Keśava dhṛta-narahari-rūpa. Dalita-hiraṇyakaśipu-tanu-bhṛṅgam. Just like with our nails, we can kill any insect. Take an ant, you can bifurcate it. Similarly, Hiraṇyakaśipu was such a giant demon, he was compared just like a little insect, and was killed by the nails of the Lord.
Then, next incarnation is Vāmanadeva. This Vāmanadeva, a dwarf, He went to Bali Mahārāja and asked him three feet land, and his guru, Śukrācārya, induced him not to promise, because He is Viṣṇu. But Bali Mahārāja was very much satisfied to offer something to Viṣṇu, he gave up the connection of his guru, because he forbade him to serve Viṣṇu. Therefore Bali Mahārāja is one of the mahājanas. Nobody can check the worship of Viṣṇu. 
If anyone checks, he may be guru, he may be father, he may be relative, he should be rejected, immediately. Therefore Bali Mahārāja is a mahājana. He showed this example: because his guru put hindrances on the path of his worshiping Lord Viṣṇu, he gave up the connection of his guru. So by this process he begged, but that was not begging, practically that was cheating. But Bali Mahārāja agreed to be cheated by the Lord. That is the symptom of the devotee. The devotee agrees to any action of the Lord, and Bali Mahārāja saw that the Lord wanted to be cheat. 
By asking three feet land, He'll take the whole universe, so he agreed. And by two feet the whole universe was covered up and down. Then Vāmanadeva asked him that where is to keep the third feet? So Bali Mahārāja agreed, "My Lord, you keep it on my head, I have got my body still.'' In this way he purchased Lord Viṣṇu, Vāmanadeva, and Vāmanadeva remained as the doorkeeper of Bali Mahārāja. So by giving everything, sarvātma snapane bali, he gave everything to Lord, and by that giving up, he purchased the Lord. He remained voluntarily as doorkeeper of Bali Mahārāja. 
So, chalayasi vikramaṇe balim adbhuta-vāmana pada-nakha-nīra-janita-jana-pāvana, when Vāmanadeva expanded His leg upwards, by His toe there was a hole in the covering of the universe, and through that hole the Ganges water came from Vaikuṇṭha. Pada-nakha-nīra-janita, and that Ganges water is flowing now in the universe sanctifying everywhere, wherever the Ganges water is there. Pada-nakha-nīra-janita-jana-pāvana.
Then next incarnation is Bhṛgupati, Paraśurāma. Paraśurāma is a śaktyaveṣa avatāra. So He, twenty-one times, killed the kṣatriyas. So out of Paraśurāma's fear, all the kṣatriyas, they migrated towards Europe, it is said in the history, Mahābhārata. So twenty-one times he attacked all the kṣatriyas. They were not in order, so He killed them, and there is a big tank in Kurukṣetra where all the bloods were reserved. Later on it became water. So kṣatriya-rudhira, in order to pacify the aggrieved Earth, He soaked the earth with the blood of the kṣatriyas, snapayasi payasi ṣamita-bhava-tāpam. Vitarasi dikṣu raṇe dik-pati-kamanīyaṁ daśa-mukha-mauli-balim ramaṇīyam. 
Then next avatāra is Rāmacandra. So the Rāvaṇa, who had ten heads, he challenged the Lord, and Lord Rāmacandra took up the challenge and killed him. Then vahasi vapuṣi viśade vasanaṁ jaladābhaṁ hala-hati-bhīti-milita-yamunābham. When Baladeva wanted Yamunā to come near Him, so she was not coming. Therefore with His plow He wanted to bifurcate the earth, and at that time Yamunā submitted, and she came near to the Lord. Hala-hati-bhīti-yamunā, hala-hati-bhīti-milita-yamunābham, Yamunā was punished by Lord Baladeva. Keśava dhṛta-haladhara-rūpa, hala, haladhara means plow, haladhara-rūpa jaya jagadīśa hare.
Next, Buddha, Lord Buddha. Nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātam. Lord Buddha defied the Vedic injunction, because His mission was to stop animal-killing, and in the Vedas, in some of the sacrifices, animal-killing is prescribed. So those who are so-called followers of the Vedic rules, they wanted to stop Buddhadeva in His mission for stopping animal-killing, so therefore when people wanted to give evidence from the Vedas, that in the Vedas there is description, there is sanction of animal-killing in sacrifices, why you are stopping? He, nindasi, He defied. And because He defied the authority of Vedas, therefore Buddha philosophy was not accepted in India. Nāstika, anyone who will deny the authority of the Veda, he'll be called a nāstika, non-believer. Vedas cannot be disrespect. So in this way, Lord Buddha, to save the poor animals, He sometimes defied the injunction of the Veda. Keśava dhṛta buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa.
The next avatāra is Kalki avatāra. We are awaiting, after four hundred thousands of years from this time, the Kalki avatāra will come, and He'll take a sword on the horseback, just like a king, He'll simply go on killing all these non-believers, Godless creatures. There will be no more preaching. As in other incarnation there is preaching, in Kalki avatāra the population of the whole world will be so much reduced to animalism that there will be no more power to understand what is God, or what is spiritualism. And it is already there, the Kali-yuga. It will increase. People will have no power to understand this philosophy, God consciousness. So at that time there is no other alternative than to kill them all, and usher in another Satya-yuga. That is the way of [indistinct]. [end]

[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, His incarnation Śrī Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Śrī Gadādhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Śrīvāsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are complete when we say, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. As preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting this Pañca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañca-tattva mantra, namely, 
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda 
śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. 
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahā-mantra [Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare], we must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Pañca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. That will be very effective.
(7)
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare 
Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare
[My dear Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord, kindly engage me in Your service. I am now embarrassed with this material service. Please engage me in Your service.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This is a prayer to Lord Caitanya. The devotee is saying, "O Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, kindly show me Your causeless mercy." Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu doyā koro more. 
"Because You have come to deliver fallen souls, so You will not find the most fallen soul like me." This is the humble prayer. We should be conscious of our fallen condition and pray to the Lord in that way, that "My dear Lord, somehow or other I am fallen. Now kindly pick me up." 
The substance of this song is like this. Of course, the language, Sanskrit, you may understand..., you may not understand, but the vibration will act. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-
trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam
prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya
vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam
This song is offering obeisances particularly to the spiritual master, and the symptoms of the spiritual master are described in this prayer. The spiritual master has two kinds of symptoms in his activities. One kind is called constant, and other kind is called temporary. 
So the first verse says that the constant symptom of the spiritual master is that he can deliver his disciple from the blazing fire of this material existence. That is the eternal qualification of spiritual master. 
[break] Trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam. Trāṇāya means for deliverance; kāruṇya means compassionate, very merciful. The spiritual master comes to the deliverance of the fallen souls out of his causeless mercy. 
Nobody has any business for the sufferings of others. The best example is Lord Jesus Christ, that he suffered for others. And it is the principle, in the Bible, that he accepted all the sins of others. This is the sign of spiritual master, that he voluntarily accepts the sinful activities of others and delivers them. That is the qualification of spiritual master. 
How it is? Just like ghanāghanatvam. Ghanāghanatvam means dense cloud in the sky. The first example has been said that this material existence is just like forest blazing fire. Now, to extinguish the forest blazing fire, there is no use of sending fire brigade. The fire brigade cannot approach the forest fire; neither any man can go there to extinguish the fire. 
One has to depend completely on the mercy of nature. That means one has to completely depend on the clouds in the sky. Otherwise, there is no question of pouring water on that blazing fire. So the example is very appropriate. As man-made engine or fire brigade is unable to extinguish the forest blazing fire; similarly, the material existentional blazing fire cannot be extinguished by any man-made method.
They are planning to be very comfortable in this material existence, but they are still more being confused and failure. That peace movement, that United Nation movement, everything is failure. Why? These miseries of this material existence cannot be stopped by any material means. One has to take the shelter of spiritual means. Just like the blazing fire in the forest has to wait for the cloud in the sky, similarly, one has to wait for the merciful cloud as the spiritual master. That is described. Trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam, prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya.
[The spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean of mercy. Just as a cloud pours water on a forest fire to extinguish it, so the spiritual master delivers the materially afflicted world by extinguishing the blazing fire of material existence. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.]
So the spiritual master is not self-made. It is not that if anyone comes before you and bluffs you that "I have attained spiritual perfection, and I have realized something by some method.'' No. The spiritual master, bona fide spiritual, means he has to receive the power from authority. Otherwise it is useless. No. It is not that one can become spiritual master overnight. He has to take the power from his spiritual master. Therefore it is called prāptasya. Prāptasya means one who has obtained, one who has got the merciful blessings of his spiritual master.
We should always remember that the spiritual master is in the disciplic succession. The original spiritual master is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He blesses His next disciple, just like Brahmā. Brahmā blesses his next disciple, just like Nārada. Nārada blesses his next disciple, just like Vyāsa. Vyāsa blesses his next disciple, Mādhvācārya. Similarly, the blessing is coming. Just like royal succession—the throne is inherited by disciplic or hereditary succession—similarly, this power from the Supreme Personality of Godhead has to receive. 
Nobody can preach, nobody can become a spiritual master, without obtaining power from the right source. Therefore the very word, it is stated here, prāptasya. Prāptasya means "one who has obtained." Prāptasya kalyāṇa. What he has obtained? Kalyāṇa. Kalyāṇa means auspicity. He has received something which is auspicious for all the humankind. Prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya. 
Here is another example: guṇārnava. Arṇava means ocean, and guṇa means spiritual qualities. Just like the same example is going on. It is very nice poetry. There is nice rhetorics and metaphor. The example is set, blazing fire, and it is to be extinguished with the cloud. And wherefrom the cloud comes? 
Similarly, wherefrom the spiritual master receives the mercy? The cloud receives his potency from the ocean. Therefore the spiritual master also receives his power from the ocean of spiritual qualities, that is, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
So prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya. Such kind of spiritual master one has to accept, and vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam, and one has to offer his respectful obeisances to such authorized spiritual master. [end]

Śrī Gurv-aṣṭaka & Purport 11
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, who appeared in the middle of the seventeenth century, is a great spiritual master in the Kṛṣṇa conscious chain of gurus and disciples. He says, "One who, with great care and attention, loudly recites this beautiful prayer to the spiritual master during the brāhma-muhūrta obtains direct service to Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of Vṛndāvana, at the time of his death."

[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, His incarnation Śrī Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Śrī Gadādhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Śrīvāsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are complete when we say, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. As preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting this Pañca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañca-tattva mantra, namely, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahā-mantra (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare), we must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Pañca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. That will be very effective.
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ 
Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu doyā koro more, tomā binā ke doyālu jagata-māyāre. This is a song composed by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He is praying Lord Caitanya that “My dear Lord, please be merciful upon me because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?’’ Actually, this is the fact. Not only Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, but also Rūpa Gosvāmī, he also prayed for Lord Caitanya when both of them met at Prayāga, Allahabad, in the first meeting of Lord Caitanya and Rūpa Gosvāmī at Prayāga. 
At that time, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also said, “My dear Lord, You are the most munificent of all incarnations because You are distributing love of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.’’ In other words, when Kṛṣṇa was personally present, He simply asked us to surrender but He did not distribute Himself so easily. He made condition that “First of all you surrender.’’ But here, in this incarnation, Lord Caitanya, although He’s Kṛṣṇa Himself, He makes no condition. He simply distributes, “Take love of Kṛṣṇa.’’ 
Therefore, Lord Caitanya is approved as the most munificent incarnation, and Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that “Please be merciful upon me. You are so magnanimous because You have seen the fallen souls of this age, and You are very much compassionate upon them. But you should know also that I am the most fallen. Nobody is greater fallen than me.’’ Patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra. “Your incarnation is just to reclaim the conditioned souls, fallen souls. But I assure You that You will not find a greater fallen than me. Therefore, my claim is first.”
Then he prays to Lord Nityānanda. He says, hā hā prabhu nityānanda, premānanda sukhī. “My dear Lord Nityānanda, You are always joyful, in spiritual bliss, and You appear always very happy. So I have come to You because I am most unhappy. So if You kindly put Your glance over me, then I may also become happy.”
Then he prays to Advaita Prabhu: prabhu sītā-pati advaita gosāi. Advaita Prabhu’s wife’s name was Sītā. Therefore He is sometimes addressed as sītā-pati. So “My dear Advaita Prabhu, the husband of Sītā, please You also be kind upon me because if You become kind upon me, then naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda also will be kind upon me.” The reason is that actually, Advaita Prabhu invited Lord Caitanya to come down. 
When Advaita Prabhu saw the fallen souls, they are all engaged simply in sense gratificatory processes without understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness, He felt very much compassionate upon the fallen souls, and He also felt Himself as incapable of claiming all these fallen souls. He therefore prayed to Lord Kṛṣṇa that “You come Yourself. Without Your personal presence, it is not possible to deliver these fallen souls.” So by His invitation Lord Caitanya appeared. “Naturally...” Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura prays Advaita Prabhu that “If You be kind upon me, naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda also will be kind upon me.”
Then he prays to the Gosvāmīs. Hā hā svarūpa, sanātana, rūpa, raghunātha. “My dear Gosvāmī Prabhus,’’ svarūpa. Svarūpa Dāmodara was personal secretary of Lord Caitanya. He was always keeping with Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and whatever He wanted, he immediately arranged for that. Two personal attendants, Svarūpa Dāmodara and Govinda, they were always constantly with Lord Caitanya. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura also praying Svarūpa Dāmodara. And then the Gosvāmīs. 
The next disciples of Lord Caitanya were the Six Gosvāmīs: Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātana, Śrī Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha, Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī, and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. These Six Gosvāmīs were directly instructed by Lord Caitanya for spreading this movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is praying also their mercy. And after the Six Gosvāmīs, the next ācārya was Śrīnivāsa Ācārya. So he’s also praying Śrīnivāsa Ācārya.
Actually, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura was in the disciplic succession after Śrīnivāsa Ācārya. Or almost he was contemporary. And his personal friend was Rāmacandra, Rāmacandra Cakravartī. So he is praying that “I always desire the company of Rāmacandra.” Devotee’s company. The whole process is that we should always be praying mercy of the superior ācāryas, and we should keep company with pure devotee. Then it will be easier for us to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to receive the mercy of Lord Caitanya and Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is the sum and substance of this song sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura.

bhaktivinodopadeśa, ekbār nām-rase māto re
[Your life may end at any moment, and you have not served the Lord of the senses, Hṛṣīkeśa. Take this advice of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: "Just once, relish the nectar of the holy name!"]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Gāy gauracand madhu sware. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. He says that Lord Caitanya, Gaura, Gaura means Lord Caitanya, Gaurasundara, the fair complexion. Gāy gauracand madhur sware. In sweet voice, He is singing mahā-mantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
In very sweet song He's singing, and it is our duty to follow His footsteps to sing the mahā-mantra. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura advises, gṛhe thāko, vane thāko, sadā 'hari' bole' ḍāko. Gṛhe thāko means either you stay at your home as a householder, or you stay in the forest as the renounced order of life, it does not make difference, but you have to chant the mahā-mantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa. 
Gṛhe vane thāko, sadā 'hari' bole' ḍāko. Always chant this mahā-mantra. Sukhe duḥkhe bhulo nā'ko, "Do not forget chanting either in distress or in happiness." Vadane hari-nāma koro re. So far chanting, there cannot be any check, because in whatever condition I may be, I can go on chanting this mahā-mantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura advises, "Never mind, you are in distress or happiness, but go on chanting this mahā-mantra." Māyā-jāle baddha ho'ye, ācho miche kāja lo'ye. You are entrapped by the network of illusory energy, māyā-jāle baddha ho'ye, just like the fisherman catches from the sea all kinds of creatures within the network. Similarly we are also within the net of illusory energy, and because we have no freedom, therefore all our activities are useless. Action in freedom has got some meaning, but when we are not free within the clutches of māya, within the network of māyā, then our so-called freedom has no value. 
Therefore, whatever we are doing is simply defeat. Without knowing our constitutional position, if you are forced to do something by the pressure of the illusory energy, it is simply useless waste of time. Therefore, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, "Now you have got full consciousness in the human form of life. So just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā-Mādhava, all these names. There is no loss but great profit." Jīvana hoilo śeṣa, nā bhajile hṛṣīkeśa. Now gradually everyone is on the verge of death, nobody can say that, "I shall remain, I shall stay for more hundred years." No, any moment we can die. 
Therefore, he advises jīvana hoilo śeṣa: "Our life is at end at any moment, and we could not serve Hṛṣīkeśa, Kṛṣṇa. Bhaktivinodopadeśa." Therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura advises, ekbār nām-rase māto re: "Please be enchanted, nām-rase, in the mellow of chanting the transcendental name. Dive yourself within this ocean. That is my request."

gopī-parāṇa-dhana, madana-manohara,
kāliya-damana-vidhāna
[Lord Kṛṣṇa is the beloved son of Mother Yaśodā; the transcendental lover in the land of Vraja; the delight of Gokula; Kāna [a nickname of Kṛṣṇa]; the wealth of the lives of the gopīs. He steals the mind of even Cupid and punishes the Kāliya serpent.]

amala harinām amiya-vilāsā
vipina-purandara, navīna nāgara-bora,
baṁśī-badana suvāsā
[These pure holy names of Lord Hari are full of sweet, nectarean pastimes. Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of the twelve forests of Vraja, He is ever-youthful and is the best of lovers. He is always playing on a flute, and He is an excellent dresser.]

nanda-godhana-rākhowālā
govinda mādhava, navanīta-taskara,
sundara nanda-gopālā
[Kṛṣṇa is the protector of the inhabitants of Vraja; the destroyer of various demoniac dynasties; the keeper and tender of Nanda Mahārāja's cows; the giver of pleasure to the cows, land, and spiritual senses; the husband of the goddess of fortune; the butter thief; and the beautiful cowherd boy of Nanda Mahārāja.]

He delights in the mellows of the rāsa dance; He is very merciful; the lover and beloved of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; the great dancer of Vṛndāvana; and the shelter and only refuge of Ṭhākura Bhaktivinoda.]

There they appeared just like madmen in the full ecstasy of love for Kṛṣṇa, exhibiting different transcendental symptoms in their bodies, and they were merged in the ecstasy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.]

They are just like the ocean of love of God, and they are popular both with the gentle and with the ruffians, because they are not envious of anyone.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed His disciples to write books on the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, a task which those who follow Him have continued to carry out down to the present day. The elaborations and exposition on the philosophy taught by Lord Caitanya are in fact the most voluminous, exacting, and consistent, due to the unbreakable system of disciplic succession of any religious culture in the world. Yet Lord Caitanya in His youth, widely renowned as a scholar Himself, left us only eight verses called Śikṣāṣṭaka.
Glory to the śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years together. Thus the fire of conditioned life, of repeated birth and death, is extinguished.
Second verse. Oh my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction upon the living beings, and therefore You have hundreds and millions of names like Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, etc. In these transcendental names You have invested all Your transcendental energies, and there is no hard and fast rule for chanting these holy names. Oh my Lord, You have so kindly made approach to You easy by Your holy names, but unfortunate as I am, I have no attraction for them.
Three. One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street, more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind, one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly. [end]

This saṅkīrtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.]
Lord Caitanya gave us eight stanzas of His mission, what He wanted to do. They are explained in eight stanzas, and they are known as Śikṣāṣṭaka. Śikṣā means instruction, and āṣṭaka means eight. So in eight stanzas He has finished His instruction, and His next disciples, the Six Gosvāmīs, have explained them in volumes of books. So Lord Caitanya says the subject is paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṇkīrtanam: all glories to the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra or Kṛṣṇa saṇkīrtan movement. All glories. All victory. How it is victory, all victory? 
That He explains, that ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam. If you chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, then the dirty things which have accumulated in your heart due to material contamination will be cleared off. He gives the example that the heart is just like a mirror. If on the mirror there are heaps of dust accumulated, then one cannot see the real face by the reflection of the mirror. Therefore, it should be cleansed. So in our present conditional life, our heart is overloaded with so much dust accumulated due to our material association from time immemorial. So if we chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, then the dust will be removed. Even not immediately, it will begin to be removed. And as soon as the mirror of the heart is cleansed of all dust, immediately one can see the face what he is. That face means real identification. By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, one will understand that he is not this body. This is our misconception. The dust means this misconception, accepting this body or the mind as self. Actually, we are not this body or the mind. We are spirit soul. So as soon as we can understand that we are not these bodies, immediately bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. The blazing fire of material conditions, or the blazing fire of material miseries, immediately becomes dissipated. No more misery. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi. 
As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā. Immediately one understands his real identification as spirit soul, he becomes joyful. We are not joyful. Due to our material contact, we are always full of anxieties. By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, we shall immediately come to the stage of joyful life. Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. And this is called liberation. When one becomes joyful, free from all anxieties, that stage is actual liberation because every living creature, the spirit soul is by nature joyful. The whole struggle for existence is that he is searching after that joyful stage of life, but he missing the point. Therefore, in every effort for joyful life we are being defeated. This constant defeat can be overcome immediately by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. That is the effect of this transcendental vibration. And after liberation, after being joyful, the material joys decreases. Whatever joy you want to enjoy, that decreases. Take, for example, for eating. If we want to eat some nice foodstuff, after eating a few morsels of food we do not like to take any more. That means here in the material world, whatever joy we accept, it will decrease. But spiritual joy, Lord Caitanya says ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam, the spiritual joy is just like ocean. But here in the material world, we have got experience that ocean does not increase. Ocean remains within its limit. But the ocean of spiritual joyfulness increases. Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇam. How it increases? He is giving the example like the moon, rising moon. As the waxing moon. As the moon from the day of new moon, new moon night, the first day it is just like a small curved line. But second day, third day it increases, gradually it increases. Similarly, the spiritual life, the spiritual joyful life increases like the moon rays day after day, day after day, till it reaches the full moon night, yes. So, 
ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam
śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇam vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam. 
And the life then becomes full of knowledge because spiritual life means eternal life, full of bliss and full of knowledge. So we increase our volumes of joy because proportionately we increase the volume of our knowledge. Śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam, ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ. It is just like a ocean, but still it increases. Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ, sarvātma-snapanaṁ. It is so nice that once situated in this state of life, one thinks that "I am fully satisfied." Sarvātma-snapanaṁ. Just like if one takes bath dipping into the water, he feels refreshed immediately. Similarly, this spiritual life increasing joys day after day makes one feeling that he is fully satisfied.

This saṅkīrtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.]

[O my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living beings, and thus You have hundreds and millions of names, like Kṛṣṇa and Govinda.

O my Lord, out of kindness You enable us to easily approach You by Your holy names, but I am so unfortunate that I have no attraction for them.]

parama karuṇa, pahuṅ dui jana,
nitāi-gauracandra
This is a song sung by Locana dāsa Ṭhākura. Almost a contemporary of Lord Caitanya. So in his appreciation of Lord Nityānanda and Lord Caitanya. He says that, “These two personalities are very merciful incarnation of God.” Parama karuṇa—highest mercy. Pahuṅ dui jana, dui jana means—two personalities and Their names are Nitāi and Gaura. Nitāi-gauracandra. So They are the best of all incarnations. That is also admitted by Rūpa Gosvāmī because Kṛṣṇa when He came. He preached only that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead but He did not give Himself. He was not so much... But in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu He gave Kṛṣṇa. That is therefore.., Caitanya Mahāprabhu addressed by Rūpa Gosvāmī: namo mahā-vadānyāya [Madhya 19.53]. The most munificent of all incarnations, is giving Himself.
parama karuṇa, pahuṅ dui jana,
nitāi-gauracandra
saba avatāra—, sāra śiromaṇi,
kevala-ānanda-kanda
[Śrī Śrī Gaura Nityānandera Dayā, 1]
And in this incarnation there is no miserable condition. He is delivering everyone simply in transcendental bliss, chanting and dancing. And giving prasādam. In other incarnation He had to take sword and this to kill to deliver the demon. In this avatāra He is delivering all the demons simply by ānanda—transcendental bliss. Kevala-ānanda-kanda. Therefore Locana dāsa Ṭhākura advises: bhaja bhaja bhāi, caitanya-nitāi—you simply worship Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda. Sudṛḍha viśvāsa kori—with firm faith and your life will be successful.
bhaja bhaja bhāi, caitanya-nitāi,
sudṛḍha viśvāsa kori
[Śrī Śrī Gaura Nityānandera Dayā, 2]
With firm faith, “Oh I have taken shelter of Nityānanda and Caitanya Mahāprabhu my life is now successful.” And... But one thing you have to do: viṣaya chāḍiyā se rase majiyā, you have to take shelter of Nityānanda prabhu and Caitanya prabhu without any material desire. Then it will not be very good. Viṣaya chāḍiyā se rase mukhe bolo—and the means and the process is simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is.. To take shelter of Gaura-Nityānanda and chant Hare Krishna mantra your life is... That is so nice. Viṣaya chāḍiyā—don’t desire any material enjoyment. Viṣaya chāḍiyā se—simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take shelter. Mukhe bolo.
Dekha dekha bhāi, tri-bhuvane nāi, now just compare Lord Nityānanda and Caitanya, these incarnations. You cannot have throughout the three worlds such merciful preacher or deliverer of the fallen souls.
dekha dekha bhāi, tri-bhuvane nāi,
emona dayāla dātā
[Śrī Śrī Gaura Nityānandera Dayā, 3]
Not only merciful but the greatest dispenser of charity. Dekha dekha bhāi, tri-bhuvane nāi, emona dayāla dātā. And He is so merciful, what to speak of human being. Even birds and bees who hear about His saṅkīrtana movement, they also become melted. Paśu-pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare—the hardest; hardest demon and the example is Jagāi and Mādhāi and many demons. They became melted simply by Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy. Paśu-pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare śuni yāra guṇa-gāthā—simply by hearing the activities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Nityānanda prabhu. So unfortunately I am so much absorbed in material sense gratification that I cannot remember Nityānanda prabhu and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. 
Viṣaya bhuliyā... Viṣaya majiyā, rohili bhuliyā—being engaged only in sense gratification I have forgotten Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda. So why? If He is so munificent, He is so merciful, a still I cannot take the advantage of it. So Locana dāsa Ṭhākura laments on our behalf. Āpana karama, bhuñjāye śamana—I am so miss-doer, miscreant that I am forced to suffer the resultant action of my mischievous activities in the past. Āpana karama, bhuñjāye śamana—the Yamarāja sword is forcing me. Kohoye locana-dāsa—this is the statement of Locana.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Parama koruṇa, paṅhū dui jana, nitāi gauracandra. This is a song by Locana dāsa Ṭhākura, a great devotee and ācārya of the Gauḍīya-sampradāya. He is declaring that paṅhū dui jana. Paṅhū means lords. Dui jana means two. Who are the two Lords? Nitāi Gauracandra. One is Lord Nitāi, Nityānanda; another is Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. 
So he says that "These two Lords are very merciful.'' Parama karuṇa, paṅhū dui jana.. Parama karuṇa means very merciful. Nitai Gauracandra. Saba avatāra-sāra- śiromaṇi. Avatāra means incarnation, and saba means all. "They are the essence of all incarnations.'' Saba avatāra-sāra-śiromaṇi, kevala ānanda-kanda: "And the specific significance of these incarnations is that to prosecute Their ways of self-realization is simply joyful,'' ānanda-kanda. 
They introduced chanting and dancing. No other incarnation... There are many incarnation, just like Lord Rāma. Even Kṛṣṇa, He taught Bhagavad-gītā. That requires knowledge, understanding. But here Lord Caitanya, Nityānanda, introduced some process which is simply joyful: simply chant and dance. Kevala ānanda-kanda. Saba avatāra-sāra- śiromaṇi, kevala ānanda-kanda.
Therefore he requests everyone, bhaja bhaja bhāi, caitanya nitāi: "My dear brothers, I request you. Just you worship Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda,'' sudṛḍha viśvāsa kari’, "with firm conviction and faith.'' Don't think that this chanting and dancing will not lead you to the desired goal. It will, because there is assurance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that you will get all perfection by this process. 
Therefore Locana dāsa Ṭhākura says that "You must have firm faith and conviction.'' It will act. Bhaja bhaja bhāi, caitanya-nitāi, sudṛḍha. Sudṛḍha means firm; viśvāsa kori’, with faith and conviction. But what is the process? The process is viṣaya chāḍiyā, se rase majiyā. If you want to be Kṛṣṇa conscious under that process, then you have to give up your engagement of sense gratification. That is the only restriction. You cannot do that. Then it will be very nice. 
If you give up sense gratification and come to this stage, then it is sure that you will reach to the desired goal. Viṣaya chāḍiyā, se rase majiyā, mukhe bala hari hari: "And you have to simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, 'Hari Hari,' that's all, without any motive of sense gratification.''
Dekha ore bhāi, tribhuvane nāi. He says, "My dear brothers, you just try and examine that within these three worlds there is nobody like Lord Caitanya or Nityānanda Prabhu.'' Because, paśu-pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare: "Their mercy and qualities are so great that even birds and beasts, they are crying, what to speak of human being?'' 
Actually, when Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed through the forest of Jhārikhaṇḍa, the tigers, the elephants, the snake, the deer, all joined Him in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is so nice. Anyone can join. Animals can join, what to speak of human being? Of course, it is not possible for ordinary man to enthuse animals to chant, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu did it actually. 
So even if we cannot enthuse animals, we can enthuse at least human being to this path of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra chanting. Paśu-pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare. And it is so nice that even the most stonehearted men will be melted. Pāṣāṇa vidare. Pāṣāṇa means stone, and vidare. Pāṣāṇa, even stone, will melt, it is so nice. 
But he regrets that, viṣaya majiyā: "Being entrapped by sense gratification...'' Viṣaya majiyā, rohili bhuliyā. He's addressing himself, "My dear mind, you are entrapped in the sense gratification process and you have no attraction for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.'' Viṣaya bhuliyā, rahili majiyā, se pade nahila āśa: "You have no attraction for the lotus feet of Caitanya-Nityānanda. So what can I say? It is only...'' 
Āpana karama, bhuñjāya śamana: "I can simply think of my misfortune only that Yamarāja, the superintendent of death, he is punishing me in this way, that he is not allowing me to be attracted to this movement.'' This is the statement of... Kahaye locana-dāsa: "This is the statement of Locana dāsa Ṭhākura.'' [end]

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

Parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana, nitāi gauracandra. This is a song sung by Locana dāsa Ṭhākura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, almost contemporary. He wrote one book, Caitanya-maṅgala, depicting the activities of Lord Caitanya. That is a very famous book, Caitanya-maṅgala. And he has composed many songs. 
Practically all Vaiṣṇavas, they are transcendentally poetic. That is one of the 26 qualifications of the Vaiṣṇava. So he says that “These two Lords,” nitāi gauracandra, “Lord Nityānanda and Lord Gaurāṅga, or Lord Caitanya, They are very merciful incarnations.’’ Saba avatāra-sāra śiromaṇi. “They are essence of all incarnations.’’ The incarnation is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā that whenever there is discrepancies in the prosecution of religiosities and there is prominence of impious activities, at that time the Lord incarnates, or He descends on this material world, for protecting the pious and annihilating the impious. That is the mission of incarnation. 
Every incarnation we’ll find two things. Lord Kṛṣṇa, He’s so beautiful, so kind, but He is very dangerous to the demons. The demons were seeing Him as thunderbolt, and the gopīs were seeing Him as the most beautiful cupid. So in the Bhagavad-gītā also it is stated, ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg 4.11]. 
[All of them—as they surrender unto Me—I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā.]
The God is realized in proportion to one’s freedom from the demoniac propensities. So in this age... Of course, the last incarnation, Kalki, He will simply kill. Long, long after, He will come. But here Lord Caitanya, His mission is no killing, simply favoring. That is the specific characteristic of Lord Caitanya. Because in this age, of course, there is very much prominence of irreligiosity. But if Lord Caitanya wanted to kill them, then there was no question of their salvation. They would be... 
Of course, anyone who is killed by incarnation he also gets salvation. But not to the spiritual planets, but they merge into the Brahman effulgence as the impersonalists desire. In other words, the impersonalist’s goal of salvation is as good as the goal of salvation of the enemies of God. That is not a very difficult job. So Lord Caitanya is merciful because He is embracing everyone by bestowing love of Kṛṣṇa. 
Rūpa Gosvāmī has described Lord Caitanya as the most munificent of all the incarnations because He is giving Kṛṣṇa to everyone, without any qualification. So Locana dāsa Ṭhākura says that parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana, nitāi gauracandra, that They are essence of all incarnation. Kevala ānanda-kanda. And Their preaching process is very pleasing. Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends “You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance nicely, and when you feel tired, just take rest and eat Kṛṣṇa prasādam.” 
So His formula is very pleasing. Kevala ānanda-kanda. While He was present in Jagannātha Purī, every day in the evening, dancing was...chanting and dancing continued. And after dancing is finished, He used to distribute sumptuously prasādam of Jagannātha. So many thousands of people used to assemble every night. So simply transcendentally pleasing, this movement. Kevala ānanda-kanda.
Then he recommends, bhajo bhajo bhāi, caitanya nitāi. “My dear brother, just try to worship these two Lords, Caitanya and Nityānanda,” sudṛḍha viśvāsa kori’, “with faith and conviction.” One should have faith in the words of Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya says that “Go on chanting. Simply by chanting, one will get all perfection of life.” So this is a fact. Unless we take to chanting, we cannot realize it; but those who are chanting, they are realizing that they’re getting all desired perfection of life very quickly. So we should chant this mantra with faith and conviction. But the only qualification required in this connection, he says, viṣaya chāḍiyā, se rase majiyā, mukhe bolo hari hari. We have to chant with faith and conviction; at the same time we should take care, we should be guarding against sense enjoyment. Viṣaya chāḍiyā, viṣaya means sense enjoyment. And chāḍiyā means give up. One should give up sense enjoyment. Of course, in this materialistic life we have got our senses and we are practiced to use them. We cannot stop it. But there is no question of stopping, but regulating it. Just like we want to eat. Viṣaya means eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. So these things are not forbidden altogether, but they are adjusted just to make it favorable for executing my Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we should not take... Just like eating. We should not eat just to satisfy the taste. We should eat only just to keep ourself fit for executing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So eating is not stopped, but it is regulated favorably. Similarly, mating. Mating is also not stopped. But the regulative principle is that you should marry and you should have sex life only for begetting children Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise don’t do it. So everything is regulated. There is no question of stopping defense also. Arjuna was fighting, defending, under the order of Kṛṣṇa. So everything is there. Nothing stop. Simply it is adjusted for executing our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Viṣaya chāḍiyā. We should not accept these viṣaya, these four principles of bodily demands, namely eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, for sense gratification. No. The politicians, they fight for sense gratification. They do not see to the good of the people. For their political aggrandizement they fight. That fight is forbidden. But when fight is necessity for defending people, that fighting should be taken. So we have to give up this principle of sense gratification, or sense gratificatory process.
Dekho dekho bhāi tri-bhuvane nāi. Then he says, “Just see, there is nobody else so merciful.’’ Paśu pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare. By His mercy even the birds and beasts, they are also maintained. Actually, when Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed through the forest known as Jhārikhaṇḍa in central India, He was only accompanied by his personal attendant, and He was alone, and when He was passing through the forest He touched one tiger. He was sleeping, and the tiger answered roaring. The company, Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s attendant, he thought, “Now we are gone.’’ But actually, Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked the tiger, “Why you are sleeping? Just stand up. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.’’ And the tiger began to dance. So actually, this happened. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, the tigers, the deers, the... everyone joined. So, of course, we are not so powerful. But it is possible that at least we have seen the dogs are dancing in saṅkīrtana. So it is possible also to take. But we may not attempt such great risk. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu could induce tigers to dance, we can at least induce every human being to dance. This is such a nice movement.
So paśu pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare. Pāṣāṇa means stone. So even the stone-hearted man also melts by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That we have experienced, seen. Pāṣāṇa vidare, śuni’ jāra guṇa-gāthā. Simply by hearing the transcendental pastimes and characteristics of Lord Caitanya, even hard-hearted men, they also melted. There were many instances, Jagāi Mādhāi. Many fallen souls, they became elevated to the highest spiritual platform. Then Locana dāsa Ṭhākura says that viṣaya majiyā, rohili bhuliyā. “Unfortunately, I am so much entrapped in these demands of the body or the senses that I have forgotten the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.’’ Viṣaya majiyā, rohili bhuliyā, se pade nahilo āśa. “I could not desire to be attached to the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya.’’ So why it is so? So he’s lamenting that āpana karama, bhuñjāye śamana, that “I am suffering the sequence of my past misdeeds, that I could not be attracted by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is a punishment on me by the Yamaraja, the superintendent of death.’’ Actually, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, saṅkīrtana movement, is so nice and attractive, every simple, I mean to say, unsophisticated person shall be attracted. But if one is not attracted, it is to be understood that he is being punished by the laws of the superintendent of death. Anyway, if we stick to this principle of chanting, then even Yamarāja, the superintendent of death, he’ll also fail to punish. That is the verdict of Brahma-saṁhitā. Brahma-saṁhitā says one who takes to this devotional life, his reaction of past deeds are adjusted immediately. So every one of us should take part in this movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. [end]

Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nityānander Dayā & Purport 8
Prabhupāda: ...pahū dui jana. Pahū means prabhu. The shortcut is pahū. Prabhu, lord, or master. So these prabhu, two, two prabhus, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is addressed as Mahāprabhu, Mahā-puruṣa. And others, they are addressed as prabhu. So these two prabhus, Nityānanda Prabhu and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, are very merciful, parama koruṇa. Parama koruṇa means extremely merciful. Extremely merciful because Kṛṣṇa is also merciful, but because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original feature... Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also Kṛṣṇa, but He is acting as devotee. He is not acting as Kṛṣṇa. He is acting as devotee of Kṛṣṇa.
namo mahā-vadānyāya
kṛṣṇa-preme-pradāya te
kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
nāmne...
He is Kṛṣṇa, but at present He has assumed the name of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.
Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya also appreciated Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He made one hundred verses about Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu, just to teach us, He destroyed the ślokas: "Oh, it is too much praising Me." So anyway, some of the ślokas were saved. Two of them are mentioned in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta. So one of the śloka, verse, is,
vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga-
śikṣārtham ekaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-śarīra-dhārī
kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye
 [Cc Madhya 6.254]
Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya is offering his obeisances to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, speaking like this, that "You are the same original person, Kṛṣṇa, but You have now assumed the form of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya just to teach vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam. You have come to teach the mass of people the art of becoming detached to this material world.'' Vairāgya-vidyā. Vairāgya. Rāgya means attachment, and virāga means detachment. 
So we fallen souls, conditioned souls, we are very much attached to this material body, and consequently, material world. This is the disease. This is called bhava-roga, or material disease, to become attached to this body. "I am Indian,'' "I am American,'' "I am white,'' "I am black''—I identify with this body because we are very much attached to this body. But if we study very deeply, "Why I am attached to this body?'' Suppose if there is some danger, immediately warning, just this roof is going to fall down, we shall immediately take care of our own body, not of our Godbrothers, because we are very much attached to this body. This is the first business, how to save this body. 
Now, the next question is "Why you are so much anxious to save this body?'' What will be the answer? Can anyone say? Why one is so much attached with this body? The answer is that because I, the real I, I am within this body, therefore I am anxious to save it. Then why you are anxious to save the soul, individual soul? The answer will be that because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So ultimately we want to love Kṛṣṇa, but because we are in a forgetful platform, then someone is trying to save his body, someone is trying to save his bodily relationship. Therefore in so many ways we are implicated with this material atmosphere.
So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to teach us how to become detached to this material. That is vairāgya-vidyā. Vidyā means vairāgya-vidyā. Vidyā does not mean to become more and more attached to this material world. That is not... That is avidyā, illusion, because I will not be able to save this body. This body will change. I will be annihilated. But still, I am very much anxious for this body. This is called illusion or ignorance or avidyā. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to teach us vairāgya-vidyā, how to become detached. He personally showed by His life example that... He was very learned scholar in Navadvīpa. His name was Nimāi Paṇḍita. And He was very influential also. He was so influential that simply by His calling, 100,000 people joined Him to show a civil disobedience movement, disobeying the order of the magistrate that "You cannot perform kīrtana." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu organized immediately about one lakh of people and went to perform at the house of the magistrate. The civil disobedience movement, perhaps you know that it was inaugurated by Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi, in India against the British government. But long, long before, five hundred years before, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He started this civil disobedience movement against the order of Kazi. 
So He was so popular. My point is that not only He was a very learned scholar... He was young man, twenty, twenty-two years, but He was so popular that He could call 100,000 people at once to start this civil disobedience, His social position. He was beautiful, Gaurasundara. His another name is Gaurasundara, very beautiful body. And a very learned scholar, Nimāi Paṇḍita. Nobody could defeat Him. And very influential and born of a very high grade brāhmaṇa family. His father, His grandfather was very, very learned scholars. So in every way He was very well situated, although the brāhmaṇas are not very rich. They do not care for money. They are interested in knowledge, brahma-jñāna. And if one knows Brahman, then he is brāhmaṇa. Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ: "Brāhmaṇa means one who knows the Absolute Truth." That is brahma-jñāna. The human life is meant for that purpose, athāto brahma jijñāsā. Everyone should be interested to enquire about Brahman, the Absolute Truth. At least, a class of man must be there in the society. That is the brain, brain of the society, brāhmaṇa. Just like you have got the brain in your body. If the brain is absent, if the brain is gone mad, then your whole body is useless. 
That is the position at the present moment. There is no brain in the society. All śūdras; no brāhmaṇas. Because nobody is interested with the Absolute Truth. Everyone is interested how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex and how to defend. That is going on, nationwide, worldwide. Therefore our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is interested to make a section of the people brāhmaṇa, brain. They can guide. It is not that everyone requires; neither it is possible. Unless one is very intelligent, he cannot become brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa means the most intellectual class of the society. That is brāhmaṇa. Satya śamaḥ damaḥ titikṣa ārjavaḥ, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg 18.42]. 
[Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brāhmaṇas work.]
These are the brāhmaṇa's qualification. He must be truthful—so much so truthful that even to his enemy he will not keep any secret. That is called truthfulness. And śamaḥ. Śamaḥ means controlling the senses. Damaḥ... Śamaḥ means controlling the mind. Mind is our enemy; mind is our friend. So if we can control the mind, the mind can act as very good friend. And if we do not control the mind, then he acts as enemy. Therefore the yoga system means controlling the mind, controlling the senses so they can act as my friend. Otherwise they will act as my enemies, kāma krodha lobha moha.
So there is necessity of a class of men who will act as the brain of the society. That is called brāhmaṇa. That is real human society, where there are four classes of men: one acting as brain; one acting as arms or armies or protection; one acting as belly, or the food digesting machine... Unless you eat and digest food, how your body will be maintained? So everything is very scientifically designed in the Vedic civilization. So in the Kali-yuga there is scarcity of brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa is vairāgya. A brāhmaṇa is not interested with pounds, shilling, pence, "Get money and enjoy." That is not brāhmaṇa's business. What is enjoyment? That is illusion. You cannot enjoy, because you are conditioned by the stringent laws of nature, and where is enjoyment? There is no enjoyment. But they are thinking, "I am enjoying." This is called illusion, māyā. There cannot be any enjoyment. When you are not free, when you are conditioned under the stringent laws of... You do not like to die; you are forced to die. You must die. You cannot say, "No, I will not die." No, that is not possible. So where is your freedom? But we are declaring, "Now we are independent." This is all illusion.
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared to save us from all these illusions. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya means living, not dead. If we have no spiritual consciousness, if we have not Kṛṣṇa's consciousness, then we are dead. This..., what is this body? This body is dead. Alive or dead, so-called dead, it is already dead because it is matter. But because there is spirit soul, it is moving. The same example: the motorcar, what is this? A lump of matter, some iron, some other metals or some rubbers, some combination. And so long the driver is there—it is moving—it is important so long it is moving. And as soon as the movement stops, you throw it away. That is very good experience in your country. So many useless motorcars are heaped together. So similarly, the brāhmaṇa means one must know that who is the driver of this body, brahma-jñāna. So at the present moment nobody knows who is driving this body. So therefore all śūdras, fourth-class men. There is no first-class man. But in the human society there must be four classes of men: first class, second class, third class... Fourth class also required for assisting the higher, third class. Everything is very nicely described in the Bhagavad-gītā, and Bhagavad-gītā was taught by Kṛṣṇa Himself. But people could not follow Him, misunderstood Him. Therefore Kṛṣṇa again came as Kṛṣṇa Caitanya to teach personally the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa.
Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not teach anything else than what was taught by Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam śikṣārtham, purāṇah puruṣaḥ. That Supreme Personality of Godhead... Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogaṁ śikṣārtham ekaḥ purāṇaḥ puruṣaḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-śarīra-dhārī [Cc Madhya 6.254]: "Now You have assumed the form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, but You are Kṛṣṇa.'' That is also Rūpa Gosvāmī said. We have to follow the mahājanas, great personality, authorities. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ [Cc Madhya 17.186]. 
[Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated self-realized person. Consequently, as the śāstras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahājanas advocate.]
We cannot manufacture a way of life. We have to follow the footprints of mahājana, great personalities. That is the way. Here, at the present moment, everyone is speculating. What is the use of speculation? You are imperfect. Your senses are imperfect. Whatever you establish, because you have established by imperfect senses, they are all imperfect. Therefore they are suffering. There is no solution. So speculative method will not help us. 
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching is... It is not as He had manufactured something. He is also following. He quoted one verse from the prayers of Lord Brahmā:
jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva
san-mukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām
sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir
ye prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām
[SB 10.14.3]
[Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.]
This is a quotation from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in Brahma's prayer to Kṛṣṇa. The purport is that you should give up this bad habit of speculation, jñāne prayāsam. Prayāsam means endeavor: "I shall get this knowledge by speculating." This is called jñāna-prayāsam, endeavoring uselessly for knowledge. So udapāsya: you give it up. Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta. Just become submissive. Don't think yourself that you are very learned. Because if the senses are imperfect, how you can be learned? Whatever you see, that is imperfect. Just like we see every day the sun, these eyes. And what we see? It is just like a disc. Is it a disc? It is fourteen hundred times bigger than this earth. So what is the value of your seeing? You cannot see what is behind the wall. Still, you are proud of seeing—"Can you show me? Can you show me God?" And what power you have got to see? That he does not consider. He thinks, "I have got seeing power." Similarly, you study every sense—they are all imperfect, blunt. So any knowledge you acquire by gymnastic of the senses—useless. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. Not Caitanya Mahāprabhu's; it is the Bhāgavata's teaching, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu's the same. So we have to give up this nonsense idea, that "I can attain to the perfect knowledge by speculation, manodharma, by speculation, manodharma, mental gymnastic." This will not help us.
So jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva. Just become submissive. And where to submit? You must submit to a perfect person. Otherwise why should you submit? Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet, samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham [Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.2.12]. 
[To understand these things properly, one must humbly approach, with firewood in hand, a spiritual master who is learned in the Vedas and firmly devoted to the Absolute Truth.]
So Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa also says,
tad viddhi praṇipātena
paripraśnena sevayā
upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
jñāninaḥ tattva-darśinaḥ
 [Bg 4.34]
[Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.]
Tattva-darśī, one who has seen the things as it is, go there and from him take the knowledge, not that one who is speculating. This is the process, Vedic process. Therefore it is called śruti. Śravaṇam. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB 7.5.23]. 
[Prahlāda Mahārāja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
Śravaṇam means hearing; kīrtanam means glorifying. Of whom? About Viṣṇu, not for anything else. [indistinct] So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved this process. When He was talking with Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, Rāmānanda Rāya suggested various methods of self-realization. So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not reject them. He said, "Yes, it is also nice, but you go farther above. Go forward still." So in this way, when Rāmānanda Rāya quoted this verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, jñāne prayāsam udapāsya, He said... No, in the beginning He had, eho bāhya, āge kaha [Cc Madhya 8.59]: "This process is not very important; it is external. If you know better than this, say." So in this way, after many rejection, when Rāmānanda Rāya came to this version, jñāne prayāsam udapāsya, Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not say that it is useless. Eho haya: "Yes, it is nice." Eho haya: "It can be accepted." That is the beginning, that don't try to speculate. Just become humble and meek and hear from the realized soul. Namanta. Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva. Just become submissive. Do not think that you know by everything. That is your illusion, māyā. Because you cannot know everything. You can..., you may know something. That is not possible that you know everything.
So to know everything perfectly you cannot do it simply by speculating or handling your senses, imperfect senses. San-mukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām [SB 10.14.3]. 
[Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.]
You hear from the realized soul. So Kṛṣṇa, hear from Kṛṣṇa. That is... He is perfect. And sthāne sthitāḥ: to hear about Kṛṣṇa, you do not require to change your position. Sthāne sthitāḥ. You are a medical man? That's all right. Remain medical man. You are scientist? That's all right. You are lawyer? That's all right. You are fool? That's all right. [laughter] Because everyone is fool, but they are divided by mental concoction that "Here is a fool; here is a learned.'' Because the learned is also a fool, but by mental concoction he is recognized as intelligent. Same mental concoction. Dvaite' bhadrābhadra sakali samana. Caitanya-caritāmṛta kaj said that "In the material world, 'This is good' and 'This is bad'—this is all mental speculation.'' Dvaite' bhadrābhadra sakali samana, ei bhāla, ei manda', saba manodharma: "That division, 'This is good; this is bad,' it is mental speculation.'' It has no value. It has no value. So this mental speculation will not help us. And therefore sthāne sthitāḥ: you remain in your position. It doesn't matter, good or bad. The mental speculator's verdict that "This is good; this is bad. This is intelligent; this is fool,'' they are all mental speculation. That will not help.
So you remain in your position. Either in good or bad, it doesn't matter. But you do one thing. Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ. You use your ear. That ear is bestowed upon everyone, either fool or learned. So use that ear, sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ, and hear attentively, and mold your life as you hear from the realized soul. Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-mano... One who remains like this, although he is imperfect fool, whatever he may be, he can conquer the ajita. Ajita means God. Nobody can conquer Him, but a devotee who sincerely hears about Him from the realized soul, he can conquer even Ajita, Kṛṣṇa. Just like gopīs. The gopīs were women, and not very high class woman—cowherd's men, in the village, not in town. Very educated, high society, brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya—no. They all belonged to vaiśya class. And they were woman, not Vedāntist, not scholar. But they conquered Kṛṣṇa. Why? And that is the... They heard about Kṛṣṇa, and they became lover of Kṛṣṇa. That is required. So that is the real qualification. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He was so strict about womanly association. Still, He recommended, ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargabhir yā kalpitā: "There is no better type of worshiping Kṛṣṇa than the system which vraja-vadhū, the gopīs, adopted to love Kṛṣṇa. That is the first class.''
That is the recommendation of Vedic śāstra. Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB 1.2.6]. 
[The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.]
First-class religion... Religion means to understand God. That is the sum and substance. The process may be different according to country, men. Just like we worship the Deity in the temple. This is also bhakti. And the Christians go to the church and offers prayer to God. That is also bhakti. That is also bhakti. Nine items of bhakti: śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam [SB 7.5.23]. 
[Prahlāda Mahārāja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanam vandanam. Vandanam is offering prayer. So they go to the church or go to the mosque, they offer prayers to the Supreme. That is also bhakti. So there is no question of what type of religion you are following. That doesn't matter. You follow anything, whatever suits you. But the result should be judged. What should be the result? The result is how to love God. That should be the result. 
If you have come to that platform, how to love God, mad after God, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu is...
yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa
cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam
śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ
govinda-viraheṇa me
Govinda-viraheṇa: "Being separated from Govinda, God, My life is vacant." This is required. It doesn't matter whether you follow Christianity or Hinduism or Muslimism. Whether you are feeling vacancy, everything vacant without Kṛṣṇa, without God—that is the test. Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa. Every moment... Because one who is feeling separation from the Lord, he is feeling also, "When I shall see Him?" So this anxiety, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa: "A moment is seeming to Me a millenium, hundreds and millions of years' separation." That is love. If you love somebody and if you... Of course, in the material world, this love is not possible. There is no love in the material world. It is all lust. So love means loving God. That is love. So the Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching this. Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam: "I am feeling one moment as a millenium, being separated from Kṛṣṇa. And the torrents of tears are coming just like torrents of rain.'' And śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvam: "And the whole world is seeming to Me vacant,'' govinda-viraheṇa me, "being separated from Govinda.'' This is love. So it doesn't matter what religious system you are following, but the result should be this, that you should be mad after God. That is the test. Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro... That is first-class religion, yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB 1.2.6], to love. Bhakti means love, service, rendering service. Adhokṣaje. Adhokṣaje means beyond the speculation of mind, mental exercise, bodily exercise. Adhokṣaja. Adhakṛta akṣaja jñānam.
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught this. And He took sannyāsa. For the benefit of the whole world, He took sannyāsa. He gave up His very opulent position in Navadvīpa, as I have told you, very learned scholar, very beautiful body, very beautiful wife, very affectionate mother, good popularity. There was no scarcity. And He was God Himself. Why there will be any scarcity? There is no question. But in spite of, He took sannyāsa for the benefit of the whole world. That Caitanya Mahāprabhu has come here in Atlanta. So you worship this Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana. They are very, very merciful, and little service will enhance your devotional service to a larger scale.
Thank you very much.

Śuddha-bhakata-caraṇa-reṇu, bhajana-anukūla. This is a song, sung by Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura in pursuance of Prahlāda Mahārāja’s instructions in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Prahlāda Mahārāja has recommended, eh. Naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghrim [SB 7.5.32] “one cannot have pure devotional attachment to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.” Naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghrim, spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ, “by touching the lotus feet of a pure devotee means immediately all misconceptions of life becomes eradicated.” 
Naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghrim, spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ, mahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo-'bhiṣekaṁ. Mahīyasām, “those who are great souls, great devotees who accept the dust of their lotus feet.” Niṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat, “unless one comes to that point it is very different to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” 
Actually it is not possible, one cannot make any advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless he accepts the dust of the lotus feet of the pure devotees. So Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura says that “the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotees is very favourable for advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” 
Śuddha-bhakata-caraṇa-reṇu, bhajana-anukūla, “it is very favourable.” Bhakata-sevā parama-siddhi prema-latikāra mūla, “the love of Godhead is always compared with a creeper as the creeper in the garden takes the shelter of another big tree.” Similarly when we approach a pure devotee and engage ourselves in the service of that pure devotee that is our shelter exactly like the creeper takes shelter of a big tree. 
Prema-latikāra, prema-latikāra, “the creeper of love stands in that position.” Mādhava-tithi “and after that following the instructions of the pure devotee,” means “mādhava-tithi.” Just like Ekādaśī. Ekādaśī is called mādhava-tithi or Janmāṣṭamī any festival in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called mādhava-tithi. 
Mādhava-tithi bhakti-jananī, “if we observe the performance of mādhava-tithi then that becomes the mother of our devotional service.” Bhakti-jananī jetane pālana kori, “one has to observe this mādhava-tithi very carefully.” 
Kṛṣṇa-basati basati boli' parama ādare bori, “and kṛṣṇa-basati, or Kṛṣṇa’s place just like Vṛndāvana, Mathurā, Dvārakā they are famous as being Kṛṣṇa’s favourites, so to live in such holy place one should be very much hankering after, kṛṣṇa-basati.” 
Gaur āmāra je-saba sthāne koralo bhramaṇa raṅge, “similarly Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has travelled many places in India, ye-saba sthāne. So one should be very much eager to see those places.” Gaur āmāra, je-saba sthāne koralo bhramaṇa raṅge, “wherever he has travelled.” 
Se-saba sthāna, heribo āmi praṇayi-bhakata-saṅge, “I want to see those places which in company with a pure devotee.” If ordinarily anyone goes to such places he will see only the street and the trees and the cars and the, but the same place when it is visited along with a devotee it has got a different effect. 
Mṛdaṅga-bādya śunite mana abasara sadā jāce, “I wish to hear the sound vibration of mṛdaṅga, kohl, it is very pleasing to me.” 
Gaura-bihita kīrtana śuni'ānande hṛdoya nāce, “and when I hear some song which is approved by the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahāprabhu then my heart dances with that song.” 
Jugala-mūrti dekhiyā mora parama-ānanda hoya, the deities there, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, when I see. I feel transcendental pleasure. 
Prasāda-sebā korite hoya sakala prapañca jaya, “and when I take, respect the prasādam offered to Kṛṣṇa then I think that I am becoming liberated,” actually it is so. The more we eat ordinary foodstuff we become entangled. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that, yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ [Bg 3.13]. 
[The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.]
“One who eats prasādam he becomes free from all contamination of life.” 
Whereas one who cooks for himself, generally people do so, generally the mass of people they purchase things, so many uneatable things, meats, fish eggs along with vegetables also. But they eat only sins, sinful life there but if you eat prasādam you become free from sin and if you do not eat prasādam you cook ordinary things for your eating then you become entangled instead. 
Je-dina gṛhe bhajana dekhi gṛhete goloka bhāya, “whenever I see at home there is worship of the Lord I think the, my household life is as good as Vaikuṇṭha.” 
Caraṇa-sīdhu dekhiyā gaṅgāsukha nā sīmā pāya, “and whenever I see the Ganges,” because the Ganges is emanating from the toe’s of Lord Viṣṇu “therefore I become highly pleased, ecstatic by seeing the Ganges River.” 
Tulasī dekhi' jurāya prāṇa, “and similarly whenever I see the Tulasī plant.”Mādhava-toṣaṇī jāni', “because I know that by offering Tulasī—Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased therefore as soon as I see a Tulasī plant I become very much ecstatic.” 
Gaura-priya śāka-sevane jīvana sārthaka māni, “similarly when I eat śāka,” green vegetable which is very dear to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “I feel that my life is now successful.”
Bhakativinoda kṛṣṇa-bhajane anakūla pāya jāhā, Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura, Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura says that “whatever I feel favourable in the matter of executing my devotional service unto the Supreme Lord every day.” 
Prati-dibase parama-sukhe swīkāra koroye tāhā, “I accept all of them every day with great pleasure.”
Kṛṣṇa-kānti: Nine, nine minutes.
Prabhupāda: Hmm. 14 and 9.
Kṛṣṇa-kānti: Almost 15. Yes.
Prabhupāda: Almost 24. [end]

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda

This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. He's asking everyone to rise early in the morning. Vibhāvarī śeṣa, the night is over, āloka-praveśa, the glimpses of sunlight are there, now you get up. Nidrā chāri uṭha jīva, don't sleep any more. That is the way of Vedic life. One should not sleep after sunrise. He must rise before sunrise. That is healthy life also. So just instantly after rising from the bed, one should chant the holy names of the Lord. Here it is suggested, bolo hari hari, now you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, mukunda murāri, Kṛṣṇa's different names. 
Mukunda means one who gives liberation. Murari, murari means Kṛṣṇa the enemy of the demon of the name Mura. Rāma is another name, celebrated, Rāma, Kṛṣṇa. Hayagrīva, Hayagrīva is another incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. Similarly Nṛsiṁha, Nara-hari, half-lion, half-man, Nṛsiṁhadeva. Vāmana incarnation, nṛsiṁha vāmana, śri-madhusūdana. Madhusūdana, there was a demon Madhu, and Kaiṭabha, they came to swallow up Brahmā after his creation, so they were killed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another name is Madhusūdana. Madhusūdana name is found in Bhagavad-gītā in various places. Madhusūdana means the enemy of Madhu. Kṛṣṇa is both friend and enemy. He is actually friend of everyone, but He becomes enemy-like for one who treats Kṛṣṇa as enemy. He is nobody's enemy, but if anyone wants to see Him as enemy, He appears like enemy. That is absolute. The demons, they want to see Kṛṣṇa as enemy, so accepting the desire of the demons, He appears before him as enemy, kills him, and gives him liberation. That is absolute pastime of Kṛṣṇa, madhusūdana brajendra-nandana śyāma. Actually God has no name, but His names are selected according to His pastime. Just like this Madhusūdana name is given to Him because He killed the Madhu demon. 
Similarly, He is known as brajendra-nandana, the son of vraja, vṛndāvana, because He appeared as the son of Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja, brajendra-nandana. Śyāma, His bodily hue is blackish, therefore He is called Śyāmasundara. Pūtanā-ghātana, kaiṭabha-śātana, jaya dāśarathi-rāma. So because He killed the demon Pūtanā, His name is pūtanā-ghātana. Ghātana means killer. Kaitabha-śātana, and He is chastiser of all kinds of dangers. Jaya-dāśarathi-rāma. In connection of His killing the Rāvaṇa, He is glorified, jaya dāśarathi. Dāśarathi means: His father name was Dāśaratha, so He is dāśarathi, dāśarathi-rāma. Yaśodā-dulāla govinda-gopāla. Yaśodā-dulāla means pet son of Mother Yaśodā. Govinda-gopāla, and He is cowherds boy, Govinda, giving pleasure to the cows. Vṛndāvana-purandara, the chief of the Vṛndāvana land. He is the center of attraction for everyone in Vṛndāvana. Rāvāṇāntakara gopī-priya-jana, He is very favorable to the gopīs, gopī-priya. Rādhikā-ramaṇa, and He always enjoys the company of Rādhārāṇī, therefore His name is Rādhikā-ramaṇa. Bhuvana-sundara-bara. So He attracted so many gopīs, that means He is attractive to the whole universe. Nobody is more attractive than Kṛṣṇa within this universe, or within anywhere, therefore He is called bhuvana-sundara-bara. Bara means the chief. Rāvāṇāntakara, mākhana-taskara, gopī-jana-vastra-hari. 
As Rāma, when He appeared as Lord Rāmacandra, He killed Rāvaṇa, rāvāṇāntakara. Mākhana-taskara, and in Vṛndāvana He is known as the butter thief. In His childhood pastime, He used to steal butter from the pots of the gopīs. That was His pleasure pastime, therefore He is called mākhana-taskara, mākhanacora. Gopī-jana-vastra-hari, and He also stolen the garments of the gopīs, while they were taking bath. This is very confidential. Actually the gopīs wanted Kṛṣṇa. They prayed to Kātyāyani-devī, goddess Kātyāyani, because He was attractive to all the girls of His age, so they wanted Kṛṣṇa as husband. So, superficially, Kṛṣṇa was of the same age, and how He could be husband for all the gopīs? But He accepted. Because the gopīs wanted to become wives of Kṛṣṇa, therefore Kṛṣṇa accepted their proposal. In order to show them the mercy, He stole the garments, because a husband can take away the covering of wife's bodily garment. Nobody can touch it. So that is the purpose, but people do not know. Therefore Kṛṣṇa-lila has to be heard from a realized soul, or this portion should be avoided. Otherwise we shall misunderstand that Kṛṣṇa took away the garments, and He was very much fallen, woman-hunter, like that. Not that. He is Supreme Lord. He fulfills the desire of every devotee. So Kṛṣṇa had no business to see the gopīs naked, but because they wanted to become wife, so He fulfilled their desire. A token, "Yes, I am your husband, I have taken your garment. Now you take your garment and go home.'' Therefore He is known as gopī-jana-vastra-hari. Brajera rākhāla, gopa-vṛnda-pāla, citta-hārī vaṁśī-dhārī. Brajera-rākhāla, the cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana, and gopa-vṛnda-pāla, His object was how to satisfy the cowherds men, including His father, uncle, they were all keeping cows, to please them. So He's gopa-vṛnda-pāla. Citta-hārī vaṁśī-dhārī, and when He was playing the flute, it was taking the heart of everyone, citta-hārī. He was taking away the heart of everyone. Yogīndra-vandana, in spite of Kṛṣṇa's playing as a small cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana, just like the village boy making jokes with His friends, but still, He is yogīndra-vandana. Yogīndra means greatest yogi, mystic. Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB 12.13.1]. 
[Sūta Gosvāmī said: Unto that personality whom Brahmā, Varuṇa, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise by chanting transcendental hymns and reciting the Vedas with all their corollaries, pada-kramas and Upaniṣads, to whom the chanters of the Sāma Veda always sing, whom the perfected yogīs see within their minds after fixing themselves in trance and becoming fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, and whose limit can never be found by any demigod or demon—unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead I offer my humble obeisances.]
The yoginaḥ, the meditation, whom they are trying to find out? This Kṛṣṇa. They are trying to find out Kṛṣṇa. So unless they come to the point of concentrating their mind on Kṛṣṇa, their yogic principle, or mystic power, is baffled. Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gata-antara [Bg 6.47]. 
[And of all yogīs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.]
Yogi, first-class yogi, must keep always Kṛṣṇa within his heart. That is perfection of yoga. Therefore it is called yogīndra-vandana, śrī-nanda-nandana, braja-jana-bhaya-hārī. Although He is worshiped by the great mystics, still He lives in Vṛndāvana as son of Nanda Maharaja, and the residents of Vṛndāvana, they feel safe and sound under protection of Kṛṣṇa. Navīna nīrada, rūpa manohara, mohana-vaṁśī-vihārī. Navīna nīrada, nīrada means cloud, His complexion is just like new cloud. New cloud, blackish, rūpa. Still He is so beautiful. 
Generally black is not considered very beautiful within this material world, but because His body is transcendental, even He is blackish, He is the universally attractive. Rūpa manohara. Mohana-vaṁśī-vihārī, simply when He stands with His flute, He, even though He is blackish, He becomes so attractive to everyone. Yaśodā-nandana, kaṁsa-nisūdana, He is very much celebrated as the son of Mother Yaśodā, He is the killer of Kaṁsa, and nikuñja-rāsa-vilāsī, and He used to dance, rasa dance, in the nikuñja, vaṁśī-vaṭa, nikuñja. Kadamba-kānana rāsa-parāyaṇa, there are many kadamba trees. Kadamba is a kind of flower that is especially grown in Vṛndāvana, very fragrant and beautiful, solid flower, round. So Kadamba-kānana, He used to enjoy His rasa dance underneath the tree of this kadamba. Ānanda-vardhana prema-niketana, phula-śara-yojaka kāma. So He was exciting the lusty desires of the gopīs, and increasing their transcendental bliss. Ānanda-vardhana prema-niketana, because He is the reservoir of all pleasure. 
The gopīs used to come to enjoy because He is the reservoir of all pleasure. Just like we go to take water from a lake where there is water. Similarly, if we want actually blissful life, then we shall draw it from the reservoir of all pleasure, Kṛṣṇa. Ānanda-vardhana, that pleasure will increase. The material pleasure will decrease, you cannot enjoy for a long time, it will decrease, but spiritual pleasure, if you want to draw it from the reservoir of all pleasure, Kṛṣṇa, then it will increase. Your pleasure potency will increase, and you will get more and more pleasure. As you increase your pleasure potency, or desire, the supply is also incessant. 
There is no limit. Phula-śara-yojaka kāma, He is the transcendental cupid. Cupid, with his bows and arrow, he increases the lusty desires of the material world. Similarly in the spiritual world, He is the supreme cupid. He was increasing the lusty desires of the gopīs. They used to come there, and both of them, there was no decrease. They were increasing their desire, and Kṛṣṇa was supplying them, without any material concept of life. They were simply dancing, that's all. Gopāṅganā-gaṇa, citta-vinodana, samasta-guṇa-gaṇa-dhāma. He's especially attractive for the gopāṅganā. Gopāṅganā means the dancers of vraja-dhama. Gopāṅgaṇa-gaṇa, citta-vinodana, they were simply absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's thought. They were so much became attracted by, attached to Kṛṣṇa, they could not give up His existence of His form within the heart for a moment, citta-vinodana, He captured the heart of the gopī, citta-vinodana. Samasta-guṇa-gaṇa-dhāma, He is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. 
Yamunā-jīvana, keli-parāyaṇa, mānasa-candra-cakora. Mānasa-candra-cakora, there is a bird which is known as cakora. He looks toward the moonshine. Similarly, He was the moon amongst the gopīs, and they were simply looking after Him. And He is the life of the river Yamunā, because He used to enjoy jumping over the river of Yamunā. Nāma-sudhā-rasa, gāo kṛṣṇa-yaśa, rākho vacana. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is requesting everyone, "Now you chant all these different names of the Lord, and save me.'' Rākho vacana mano: "My dear mind, please keep my word. Don't refuse, go on chanting all these holy names of Kṛṣṇa."
