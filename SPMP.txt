"Songs composed by the äcäryas are not ordinary songs. When chanted by pure Vaiñëavas who follow the rules and regulations of Vaiñëava character, they are actually effective in awakening the Kåñëa consciousness dormant in every living entity."
      — A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

I am an impious sinner and have caused others great anxiety
(1)

[I am an impious sinner and have caused others great anxiety and trouble.]

[I have never hesitated to perform sinful acts for my own enjoyment. Devoid of all compassion, concerned only with my own selfish interests, I am remorseful seeing others happy. I am a perpetual liar, and the misery of others is a source of great pleasure for me.]
(3)

[The material desires within the core of my heart are unlimited. I am wrathful, devoted to false pride and arrogance, intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by worldly affairs. Envy and egotism are the ornaments I wear.]
(4)

[Ruined by laziness and sleep, I resist all pious deeds; yet I am very active and enthusiastic to perform wicked acts. For worldly fame and reputation I engage in the practice of deceitfulness. Thus I am destroyed by my own greed and am always lustful.]
(5)

[A vile, wicked man such as this, rejected by godly people, is a constant offender. I am such a person, devoid of all good works, forever inclined toward evil, worn out and wasted by various miseries.]
(6)

[Now in old age, deprived of all means of success, humbled and poor, Bhaktivinoda submits his tale of grief at the feet of the Supreme Lord.]

Ämära jévana sadä päpe rata nähiko puëyera leça. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura in Vaiñëava humbleness. A Vaiñëava is always meek and humble. So he is describing the life of the people in general, taking himself to be one of them. The people in general are like the description given here. 
He says that "My life is always engaged in sinful activities, and if you try to find out, you will not find even a trace of pious activities. Only full of sinful activities. And I am always inclined to give trouble to other living entities. That is my business. I want to see that others are suffering, and I enjoy.'' 
Nija sukha lägi' päpe nähi òori. "For my personal sense gratification, I do not care for any sinful activities. That means I accept any kind of sinful activity if it is satisfactory to my senses.'' 
Dayä-héna swärtha-paro. "I am not at all merciful, and only I see to my personal interest.'' 
Para-sukhe duùkhé. "As such, when others are suffering I become very happy, and always talking lies,'' sadä mithyä-bhäñé. "Even for ordinary things I am accustomed to speak lies.'' 
Para-duùkha sukha-karo. "And if one is suffering, that is very pleasant to me.'' 
Açeña kämanä hådi mäjhe mora. "I have got lots of desire within my heart, and I am always angry and falsely prestigious, always puffed up with false pride.'' 
Mada-matta sadä viñaye mohita. "I am captivated in subject matters of sense gratification, and almost I am crazy.'' 
Hiàsä-garva vibhüñaëa. "My ornaments are enviousness and false pride.'' 
Nidraläsya hata sukärje birata. "I am subdued, or I am conquered by sleep and laziness,'' sukärje birata, "and I am always averse to pious activities,'' akärje udyogé ämi, "and I am very enthusiastic to perform impious activities.'' 
Pratiñöha lägiyä çäöhya-äcaraëa, "I always cheat others for my prestige.'' 
Lobha-hata sadä kämé, "I am conquered by greediness and always lusty.'' 
E heno durjana saj-jana-barjita, "So I am so fallen, and I have no association of devotees.'' 
Aparadhi, "Offender,'' nirantara, "always.'' 
Çubha-kärja-çünya, "In my life, there is not a beat of auspicious activities,'' sadänartha manäù, "and my mind is always attracted by something mischievous.'' 
Nänä duùkhe jara jara. "Therefore at the fag end of my life, I am almost invalid by all such sufferings.'' 
Bärdhakye ekhona upäya-vihéna, "In my old age I have no other alternative now,'' tä 'te déna akiïcana, "therefore by force, I have now become very humble and meek.'' 
Bhaktivinoda prabhura caraëe, "Thus Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura is offering his statement of life's activities at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord."

My mind never finds any satisfaction or happiness

[I have fallen into the ocean of material existence as a result of my selfish activities, which are without beginning, and I see no means of deliverance from this great ocean of nescience. Day and night my heart burns from the poison of these worldly activities, and on account of this my mind never finds any satisfaction or happiness.]

[Hundreds and thousands of desires, like nooses around my neck, constantly give me misery and trouble. In that great ocean of nescience play the waves of materialistic tendency. In this world there are many thieves and rogues, of whom six are prominent; lust, anger, greed, illusion, and madness. They are causing me great fear, and in this way my life is coming to an end.]

[The two highway robbers, mental speculation and fruitive activity, have cheated me and misled me, and finally they are throwing me into the ocean of misery. At such a time as this, my dear Kåñëa, You are the only friend, and You are the ocean of mercy and compassion. I have no strength to get out of this ocean of nescience, so I pray to Your lotus feet that You will be kind and by Your strength uplift me from this ocean of suffering.]

Anädi karama-phale. Anädi karama-phale pori' bhavärëava-jale taribäre nä dekhi upäya. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura depicting the picture of the conditioned soul. It is said here, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura is speaking, taking himself as one of the ordinary human being, that due to my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen in this ocean of nescience, and I do not find any means of coming out of this great ocean. It is just like the ocean of poison, e viñaya-halähale, divä-niçi hiyä jvale. 
As, if anyone takes some pungent food, it burns the heart, similarly, as we are trying to be happy by sense enjoyment, actually it is just becoming the opposite, a cause of burning our heart. E viñaya-halähale, divä-niçi hiyä jvale, that burning sensation is going on twenty-four hours, day and night. 
Mana kabhu sukha nähi päya, and on account of this my mind is not at all in satisfaction. Äçä-päça-çata-çata kleça dey abirata, I am always making plan, hundreds and thousands, how I shall become happy, but actually all of them giving me trouble, pains, twenty-four hours. 
Pravåtti-ürmira tähe khelä, it is exactly like the waves of the ocean, always dashing one another, that is my position. Käma-krodha-ädi caya, bäöapäre dey bhaya, besides that, there are so many thieves and rogues. Especially they are six in number, namely lust, anger, envy, illusion, and so many ways, they are always present, and I am afraid of them. Abasäna hoilo äsi' belä, in this way, my life is becoming advanced, or I am coming to the point of end. 
Jïäna-karma öhaga dui, more pratäriyä loi, although this is my position, still, two kinds of activities, namely mental speculation and fruitive activities, they are cheating me. Jïäna-karma öhaga, öhaga means cheater. There are jïäna-karma öhaga dui, more pratäriyä loi, they are misleading me, and abaçeñe fele sindhu-jale, after misleading me, they bring me on the seashore, and pushes me down within the sea. 
E heno samaye bandhu, tumi kåñëa kåpä-sindhu, under the circumstance, my dear Kåñëa, you are the only friend, tumi kåñëa kåpä-sindhu.

"Wake Up Sleeping Souls!"

Prabhupäda: 
jév jägo, jév jägo, gauracända bole
kota nidrä jäo mäyä-piçäcéra kole
[Lord Gauräìga is calling, "Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! You have slept so long on the lap of the witch Mäyä!]
bhajibo boliyä ese saàsära-bhitare
bhuliyä rohile tumi avidyära bhare
[You came into this world of birth and death saying 'My Lord, I will certainly worship You,' but you have forgotten this promise and remained in great ignorance.]
tomäre loite ämi hoinu avatära
ämi binä bandhu ära ke äche tomära
 [I have descended just to save you. Except for Me, who is your friend?] 
enechi auñadhi mäyä näçibäro lägi'
hari-näma mahä-mantra lao tumi mägi'
[I have brought the medicine to eradicate the disease of illusion. Now pray for this Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra and take it.]
bhakativinoda prabhu-caraëe pariyä
sei hari-näma-mantra loilo mägiyä
[Bhaktivinoda fell at the lotus feet of Lord Gauräìga, and after begging for the holy name, he received that mahä-mantra.]

Jév jägo, jév jägo, gauracända bole. Jév means the living entities. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu is asking all living entities to "Wake up. Please wake up. Please get up." Jägo. Jägo means "Wake up."
jév jägo, jév jägo, gauracända bole
kota nidrä jäo mäyä-piçäcéra kole
[Lord Gauräìga is calling, "Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! You have slept so long on the lap of the witch Mäyä!]
"How long you shall go on sleeping on the lap of the witches, mäyä?" Bhajibo boliyä ese saàsära-bhitare: "In the womb of your mother you promised that this life you shall engage in the matter of developing your Kåñëa consciousness." Bhuliyä rohile tumi avidyära bhare: "But you are forgotten everything under the spell of illusory energy." 
Actually, when the child remains within the womb of his mother, packed up in airtight bag, at the age of seven months within the womb, when he develops his consciousness, he feels very uncomfortable, and the fortunate baby prays to God, "Please relieve me from this awkward position, and this life I shall fully engage myself in developing my God consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness." But as soon as the child comes out of the womb of his mother, under the spell of these three modes of material nature he forgets, and he cries, and the parents take care, and the whole thing is forgotten.
There is one instance of Parékñit Mahäräja. When he was in the womb of his mother, their paternal, I mean to say, enemy, Droëa..., son of Droëäcärya, Açvatthämä, he released a weapon called brahmästra. The brahmästra could kill even within the womb. So at that time Lord Kåñëa entered and saved the child. The child saw the form of Kåñëa and was remembering. And when the child came out, he was trying to find out where is that form. He was searching after Kåñëa. So the astrologers who were present there, they could understand that "This child is seeking something." Therefore his name was given, Parékñit. Parékñit means one who is trying to test. Parikña. Parikña means test, examination. 
So there are many examples. Of course, very rare the child remembers. Generally forgets. So Lord Caitanya is trying to wake up all children of mäyä, nature's son, to wake up. The similar instruction is in the Vedic Upaniñad: uttiñöhata jägrata. The advice is that "Everyone should now wake up. They should not sleep under the spell of illusion, material nature. This human form of body must be utilized." The same thing Lord Caitanya is speaking in ordinary song, jév jägo, jév jägo, gauracända bole: "All living entities wake up. Don't miss this opportunity." Kota nidrä jäo mäyä-piçäcéra: "How long you shall remain asleep in this way, under the spell of mäyä? This is the opportunity. Don't sleep."
Then He says, "You have forgotten. But I have brought one medicine so that..." Just like when a man remains unconscious under some intoxication or snake bite, there are some herbs. If it is put before the nostril and if the patient smells, immediately he gets consciousness. Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu said that "I have brought also one medicine." Enechi auçädhi mäyä nasibaro lagi': "This medicine can dissipate your this forgetfulness under the spell of mäyä." Enechi auñadhi mäyä näçibäro. What is that? Hari-näma mahä-mantra lao tumi: "This is this chanting Hare Kåñëa mantra. You please take it."
The idea is that if one simply chants Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, his unconscious stage, or sleeping stage under the spell of illusory mäyä, will gradually vanish. Ceto-darpaëa-märjanam [Cc Antya 20.12].
[Let there be all victory for the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kåñëa, which can cleanse the mirror of the heart and stop the miseries of the blazing fire of material existence. That chanting is the waxing moon that spreads the white lotus of good fortune for all living entities. It is the life and soul of all education. The chanting of the holy name of Kåñëa expands the blissful ocean of transcendental life. It gives a cooling effect to everyone and enables one to taste full nectar at every step.]
So this is a song composed by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. So he says that bhakativinoda prabhu-caraëe pariyä: "Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura took the advantage of the instruction of Lord Caitanya and immediately fell down on the lotus feet of the Lord," hari-näma mahä-mantra loilo mägiyä, "and very humbly he begged Lord Caitanya, 'Kindly give me this medicine, and I shall utilize it.' '' 
The whole instruction is that all sleeping members of the human society, they should take advantage of this Kåñëa consciousness movement, and willingly they should accept. Then there will be immediate effect, and everyone will be out of the clutches of mäyä, and his original consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness, will be awakened, and his life will be sublime. [end]

[It is the desire and great longing of Govinda Däsa to engage himself in the nine processes of bhakti, namely hearing the glories of Lord Hari and chanting those glories, constantly remembering Him and offering prayers to Him, serving the Lord's lotus feet, serving the Supreme Lord as a servant, worshiping Him with flowers and incense and so forth, serving Him as a friend, and completely offering the Lord one's very self.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Bhajahü re mana, çré-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraëäravinda re. This is a song composed by Govinda däsa, a great poet and Vaiñëava. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that if you have your mind controlled, then your mind is the best friend. But if your mind is uncontrolled, then he is your greatest enemy. So we are seeking after friend or enemy. So both of them are sitting with me. If we can utilize the friendship of the mind, then we are elevated to the highest perfectional stage. But if we create mind as my enemy, then my path to hell is clear. 
Therefore Govinda däsa Öhäkura, he is addressing his mind. The yogis try to control the mind by different gymnastic process. That is also approved. But it takes a long time, and sometimes there are failures. In most cases they are failures. Even a big yogi like Viçvämitra, he also failed, what to speak of these teeny and nonsensical yogis.
So Govinda däsa advises that "You just engage your mind in Kåñëa consciousness. Then mind becomes automatically controlled.'' If the mind has no chance of being engaged in any other business except Kåñëa consciousness, then he cannot become my enemy. It is automatically my friend. That is the instruction in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam: sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù [SB 9.4.18]. 
[Mahäräja Ambaréña always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Kåñëa, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kåñëa or about Kåñëa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kåñëa, Kåñëa's temples and Kåñëa's places like Mathurä and Våndävana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasé offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasäda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahäräja Ambaréña never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.]
Lord, King Ambaréña, he first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa. So similarly, here also, Govinda däsa Öhäkura, he is asking his mind: "My dear mind, you just engage yourself to the lotus feet of abhaya-caraëäravinda.'' That is the name of the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Abhaya means fearless. 
If you take shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa then you immediately become fearless. So he advises "My dear mind, you just engage yourself on the service of the lotus feet of Govinda.'' Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana. He does not say "Govinda.'' He addresses Kåñëa as "the son of Nanda Mahäräja.'' "Because that lotus feet is fearless, you will have no more any fear from the attack of mäyä."
"Oh, I have got to enjoy so many things. How can I fix up my mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa?'' Then Govinda däsa advises, "No, no.'' Durlabha mänava-janma. "You don't waste your life in that way. This human form of life is very rare. Out of many, many thousands and millions of births, you have got this opportunity.'' Durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge. "Therefore don't go anywhere. You just associate with pure devotees.'' Taraha ei bhava-sindhu re. "Then you shall be able to cross of the ocean of nescience.'' "Oh, if I engage my mind always in Kåñëa, then how I shall enjoy my family, my other paraphernalia?'' 
So Govinda däsa says, ei dhana yauvana. "You want to enjoy your wealth and your youthful ages,'' ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, "and you want to enjoy the society of friendship, love and family, but I say,'' ithe ki äche paratéti re, "do you think that there is transcendental pleasure in this nonsense thing? No, there is none. It is simply illusion.'' Ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, ithe ki äche paratéti re. Durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge, taraha ei bhava sindhu re, çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa ei dina jäminé jägi 're, viphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana capala sukha-laba lägi' re. 
Govinda däsa is reminding his mind: "You have experience of your material happiness. So material happiness means, the ultimate goal of material happiness is sex life. But don't you remember how long you can enjoy this sex life?" Capala. "Flickering. Say, for a few  Minutes or moment. That's all. But for that purpose you are working so hard?" Çéta ätapa. "Don't care for snowfall. Don't care for scorching heat. Don't care for torrents of rain. Don't care for keeping night duty. Whole day and night you are working. 
And what is the result? Simply for that flickering momentous enjoyment. Are you not ashamed of this?" So çéta ätapa, bäta bariñaëa, ei dina jäminé jägi re. Dina means day, and jäminé means night. "Day and night, you are working so hard. Why?" Capala sukha-laba lägi' re. "Simply for that flickering happiness." Then he says, ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, ithe ki äche paratéti re. "There is no happiness actually, eternal happiness, transcendental happiness, in enjoying this life, or this youthful age, or family, society. There is no happiness, no transcendental happiness."
Therefore kamala-dala-jala, jévana öalamala. "And you do not know how long you shall enjoy this life. Because it is tottering. You are on the tottering platform. Just like there is water on the lily leaf. It is tilting. At any moment it will fall down. So our life is tilting. At any moment it may collapse. We may meet, by chance, any danger, and finished. So don't waste life in that way.'' Bhajahü hari-pada néti re. "Be always engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the success of your life.'' 
And how to discharge this Kåñëa consciousness? He advises, çravaëa kértana, smaraëa vandana, päda-sevana däsya re. You can adopt out of the nine ways of devotional service any one. If you can adopt all of them, that's very nice. If not, you can adopt eight of them. You can adopt seven of them, six of them, five of them, four of them. But even if you adopt only one of them, your life will be successful. What are those nine methods? Çravaëaà kértanam. Hearing from authoritative sources. And chanting. Çravaëaà kértanam. Smaraëam. Memorizing. Vandanam, prayers. 
Çravaëa kértanaà, smaraëaà vandana. Päda-sevanam. Offering service to His lotus feet as eternal servant. Püjana sakhé-jana. Or just try to love Kåñëa as your friend. Ätma-nivedana. Or give up everything for Kåñëa. That is the way of devotional service, and Govinda däsa is aspiring after that Kåñëa consciousness business.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

So this song was sung by Govinda däsa. Govinda-däsa-abhiläsa re. What is his desire? Abhiläsa means desire. Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana: “My dear mind...’’ Because mind is our friend and enemy. If you train the mind, then mind is your best friend. And if you cannot train your mind, then it will be your bitterest enemy. Sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù [SB 9.4.18]. 
[Mahäräja Ambaréña always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Kåñëa, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kåñëa or about Kåñëa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kåñëa, Kåñëa's temples and Kåñëa's places like Mathurä and Våndävana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasé offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasäda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahäräja Ambaréña never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.]
Therefore, mind has always to be engaged on the lotus feet of Kåñëa, then mind automatically will be controlled and will become friend. So Govinda däsa is expressing his desire: “My dear mind, you just be engaged in devotional service of Nanda-nandana.’’ His..., he does not say Kåñëa. He says Nanda-nandana. Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana. If we address Kåñëa directly, that is not very pleasing, but if we say Kåñëa: Nanda-nandana, Yaçodä-nandana, Devaké-nandana, Pärtha-särathi—in relationship with His devotee—then He becomes more pleased. 
So bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana. Why Çré-Nanda-nandana? Now, abhaya-caraëäravinda re. If you take shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, Nanda-nandana, then you’ll have no more anxiety, fear.
samäñritä ye pada-pallava-plavaà
mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù
bhavämbudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà
padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm
[SB 10.14.58]
[For those who have accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Muräri, the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoof-print. Their goal is paraà padam, Vaikuëöha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.]
This is Bhagavat-darçana. Padaà padaà yad vipadäm. This material world, padaà padam means step by step there is danger. So one who takes shelter of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù samäñritä, for him there is no more danger. Abhaya-caraëäravinda re. How it is possible to take complete shelter of Kåñëa, which is fearlessness, no anxiety, vaikuëöha? Durlabha manava-janama sat-saìge. This is possible if you associate with devotees. If you think that “Now I have become very much advanced. Now I shall live alone and chant Hare Kåñëa, imitating Haridäsa Öhäkura,’’ this is nonsense. You cannot imitate Haridäsa Öhäkura. You have to associate with devotees. Durlabha manava-janama sat sange. Sat-sange. Satäà prasaìgän mama vérya-saàvido [SB 3.25.25]. 
[In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very pleasing and satisfying to the ear and the heart. By cultivating such knowledge one gradually becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is freed, and his attraction becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional service begin.]
If you remain with the devotees, then by their association, by talking with them, you’ll get real understanding of God consciousness. It is very practical to understand. Just like in material world there are many associations, societies. Businessmen, they have got their Stock Exchange association. Those who are dealing in exchange, they have got an association. They go there, and their business facility is very good. Similarly, so many clubs. If you want to drink and enjoy sense, you go to so many clubs and associate with them and you’ll learn how to drink, how to mate very nicely. So association is very important thing. Therefore, our Kåñëa consciousness society, we are giving chance people to associate with us so that they will be able to understand what is Kåñëa, what is Kåñëa consciousness. 
Therefore Govinda däsa recommends, durlabha mänava-janama-sat-saìge. Mänava. This human life is durlabha, very rarely obtained. Not dogs’ association, crows’ association, but swans’ association. There are association even by nature. “Birds of the same feather flock together.’’ Crows, they’ll mix with crows, and the swans will mix with swan. White swan in very nice water, nice garden, they will like that. The crows will not like that. The crows will like where filthy things are thrown away. They’ll take pleasure there. 
So similarly, according to the quality of nature, there are different association in human society. So it is recommended that durlabha mänava sat-saìge: not with the crows but with the swans. You give the swan milk and water, it will take the milk portion and give it up the water portion. Similarly a swan, a haàsa, paramahaàsa means in this human form of life, one who takes the spiritual portion of life and rejects the material portion of life, he is called haàsa, paramahaàsa. We are mixed. Our body is material, but I am spirit soul. So we have to know the techniques how to get out of this material bondage. 
It will come out from this material body, but when it comes out, then it will vanquish the material body. Very good example. The fire, there is..., in the wood there is fire, everyone knows. So you ignite fire, and if you make it dry, then the fire takes place very quickly. And when it is blazing fire, then the wood becomes vanquished. There is no more existence of the wood. Similarly, if you can invoke your spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness, when it will be very nicely going on, then your material existence will be finished. This is the process. Durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge taraha e bhava-sindhu re. In this way, just get on the other side of this ocean of nescience.
Then, one may say that “If I associate with the Kåñëa consciousness movement, then how my family affairs will go on? Who will look after my wife and children, society, friendship, love? I have got so many business.’’ Therefore he says, çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa ei dina jäminé jägi re: “My dear mind, you are working so hard.’’ Çéta ätapa. “In severe cold you are going to work. In scorching heat you are going to work. Torrents of rain... You cannot stop your work.’’ Çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa. “Night duty, whole night working.’’ People are doing that. Çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa ei dina jäminé jägi re. Whole day work, again I’ll get some more money, I’ll let you work at night also, extra. In this way we are working. Why you are working? Why you are working?
çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa
ei dina jäminé jägi re
biphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana
capala sukha labha lägi’ re
“In this way I have wasted my time,’’ biphale sevinu, “to serve kåpana durajana, some so-called society, friendship and love. Kåpaëa, they will not...never be engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, but I am engaged in their service.’’ So this is general, not that every, every family. Mostly 99.9. So biphale sevinu, “In this way I am wasting my time. And what is the pleasure?’’ Capala sukha-labha lägi’ re. “Few  Minutes sex, that’s all.’’ Behind this sex, so many labor. Therefore, Govinda däsa says that “You are trying to enjoy wealth,’’ ei-dhana, yauvana, putra, parijana. Material happiness means to acquire money, dhana; and then jana, many adherents or dependents—wife, children, friends, society, so many things, country. So putra, parijana, ithe ki äche paratéti re. “You cannot have any transcendental bliss in this.’’ 
Kamala-jala-dala, jévana öalamala. The life is tottering. You cannot say when the life will be finished. The example is given, kamala-jala-dala. Just like lotus leaf. If you put water on the leaf, it will not stay, it will be tiltering. At any moment it slips. Similarly, our life is like that, tiltering. At any moment—finished. Kamala-jala-dala, jivana..., bhajahu hari-pada néti re. Therefore, engage yourself in Kåñëa consciousness as much as you can finish before the death comes. That is your mission. And what is Kåñëa consciousness? Çravana, kértana, smarana, vandana, päda-sevana, püjana, sakhé-jana, ätma-nivedana, the nine kinds of devotional service, govinda-däsa-abhiläña re.
So everyone should desire like Govinda däsa. Çravana kértana, these are the devotional process: hearing; chanting; remembering; arcana, worshiping the Deity; vandana, offering prayer. There are nine kinds. So human life is meant for this purpose. And by this process, gradually we ignite the fire of Kåñëa consciousness, or spiritual consciousness. Then, by that fire, as by blazing fire the wood itself becomes burnt into ashes, so our, all of our covering... The spirit soul is covered by matter, by ignorance. So this covering and ignorance will be burnt into ashes, and you’ll become free and go back to home, back to Godhead. This is the purport of this song.

[Govinda Däsa longs to hear the glories of Lord Hari, chant His glories, constantly remember Him, offer Him prayers, serve His lotus feet, become His servant, worship Him, serve Him as a friend, and completely offer Him his very self.]

This is a song which a devotee is praying and asking his mind, bhajahü re mana. Mana means mind. Because, at the present moment, our mind is the driver, and this body is just like a car. In the Bhagavad-gétä also it is stated, bhrämayan sarva-bhütäni yanträrüòhäni mäyayä [Bg 18.61], this body is a car made of this material nature. 
[The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.]
The living entity, what is said "I," I am now seated on this car prepared by the nature, material nature. And the driver is the mind. And the driver is not in my control. The driver is taking me anywhere he likes. You see? I am... Personally, I am not able to drive. I have engaged one driver, which is called the mind, and this body is the car, and the mind is carrying me...
Woman: Like driver. 
Prabhupäda: ...like driver, anywhere it likes. So therefore the proprietor, I, I am, I am requesting the driver... When I am helpless, so I am requesting, "My dear mind," bhajahü re mana, "my dear mind..." Mana means mind. "You kindly worship Lord Kåñëa." Çré-nanda-nandana. Çré-nanda-nandana means Lord Kåñëa. 
Lord Kåñëa appeared as the son of Vasudeva, and He was accepted by Nanda Mahäräja as his..., what is called? Son who is accepted from others? So he, he was His foster father. So he's reques... "I am requesting that you worship Lord Kåñëa, who is abhaya-caraëa." Abhaya-caraëa means He's the fearless shelter. If we take shelter of Kåñëa, then we become free from all anxieties. Just like a helpless child, when he's taken care of by his parents, he becomes careless..., carefree, not careless. Carefree. "Similarly, I am requesting, my dear mind, 'You do not drive in this way, dangerously. Please worship Lord Kåñëa, who is fearless shelter.' " Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraëäravinda re: "His lotus feet is fearless shelter."
One who takes shelter... As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja [Bg 18.66]. 
[Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.]
Now, either you say Kåñëa or you say superconsciousness... Superconsciousness is impersonal conception of Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is personal conception of superconsciousness. Because Kåñëa means He's not only superconscious, but He's supreme bliss and supreme knowledge—supreme knowledge means superconsciousness—and eternal, supreme consciousness, supreme bliss. That is the definition of Kåñëa.
Now, then the devotee says that durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge taroho e bhava-sindhu re. Now, this body, this human body, is durlabha. Durlabha means very valuable. It is obtained with..., after a great struggle of existence. We have to come through so many species of life: aquatics, birds, then trees, then reptiles, then beasts... There are so many. So many. There are eighty-four lakhs, means 8,400,000 species of life, and we had to pass through by gradual evolution. This theory is accepted by Darwin also, evolutionary theory. So this human body is very valuable. 
So he requests, "My dear mind..." Mind, of course, the..., in the lower animal life the mind is there also. Also mind is not developed, but they have got mind. It is a... In the very lower animal living condition, the mind is not at all developed, but at least, in animal life, there is mind. Now, the devotee requesting that "This life, this human form of life, is very valuable. Don't waste it. Don't waste it, but you just to make your life successful in the association of saints and sages."
Woman: What?
Prabhupäda: Saints. Saints. S-a-i-n-t-s. Saints and sages.
Woman: No, no.
Prabhupäda: You have no saint?
Girl: Saints and sages, s-a-i...
Woman: Saints?
Prabhupäda: Saints.
Woman: Oh, saints and sages.
Prabhupäda: Yes. Saints and sages. You see? "So you should not make association with anybody else, but you make your association only with saints and sages and make your this valuable human form of life successful. Don't waste your time. You worship Lord Kåñëa with the help of the saints and sages and make your life successful." That he is requesting. "Don't drive in this irresponsible way to put me into the ocean." 
And it is also requested that "We are just like in the ocean of birth and death." This material cosmic situation is sometimes explained as the ocean, and these planets, they are explained as islands. And actually, they are islands in the air. Just like we have got islands in the sea and ocean, similarly, these planets are islands in the air, air islands, so many planets.
So he says that durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge tara e bhava-sindhu re. Bhava-sindhu. Bhava-sindhu means this cosmic situation where birth and death is going on continually, one after another. "So you stop this business of repeated birth and death. You make your this human form of life successful and get release from this disease of birth and death." Birth and death is a sort of disease for the living entity. It is not the normal condition. Due to our this abnormal encagement in the material body, we are put into the birth and death. Otherwise, I am not subjected to birth and death. I am eternal. I am eternal. 
So he is requested that "Don't waste your time, my dear mind." Because mind is taking me here and there. So he's requesting mind. It is very philosophical. This is concentration, requesting the mind, "Don't put me into the ocean of birth and death. Please save me, and just make your life successful in the association of saints and sages. That is my request." 
Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana. So worship, worship of Lord Kåñëa or the Supreme Lord and, at the same time, association of saints and sages, that makes our life successful. Association of good persons and, at the same time, simultaneously, devotional service to the Lord. These two things combinedly can make our life successful.
Woman: How do you call devotion to the Lord?
Prabhupäda: Eh? Yes. Lord... We worship Kåñëa, the symbol of supreme consciousness. Because in the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that kleça adhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm [Bg 12.5]. 
[For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.]
If you take up impersonal, simply consciousness, then you have to pass through difficult process. But if you accept the symbol, Kåñëa, the symbol of supreme consciousness, that will be easier for you. Yes. It is said. So Kåñëa... I can concentrate my mind. I can focus my mental activities in the service of the Lord, Kåñëa. Because He is supreme consciousness, therefore automatically I concentrate on the supreme consciousness. 
So,
bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana-

[O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the son of Nanda, which make one fearless. Having obtained this rare human birth, cross over this ocean of worldly existence by associating with saintly persons.]
Then he says that "What I am doing? What is my present occupation?" The present occupation is,
çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa
e dina jäminé jägi re
biphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana
capala sukha-laba lägi' re
[Day and night I remain sleepless, suffering heat and cold, wind and rain. For a bit of flickering happiness I have vainly served wicked and miserly men.]
He says that "I am working hard, day and night. And there is no question of winter or summer or rainy season. I have to work hard, day and night. If there is night duty in the winter season, I have to join my office at twelve o'clock at night. So I must go. There is snowfall. If I don't go, then I'll be absent. So I am working so hard, very hard.'' Çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa, jäminé jägi re. 
"And what for I am working?'' Now, biphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana: "Just to serve persons who cannot protect me." "Who cannot protect me.'' We think that my wife or my husband or my children or my relatives or my friends and, oh, so many we have got, relationship with this material world... And everyone is working to satisfy his relatives. A family man is working so hard because he has to satisfy his wife, children, friends and so many other person. But one should be conscious that "These friends and relatives, they cannot protect me ultimately. They are... Neither I can protect them, nor they can protect me.'' You see? 
Everyone responsible. Everyone is responsible for his own activity. Besides that... Now, suppose if I am constructing a high building, skyscrapers—just like you have got very good experience in this country—if somebody asks me that "Why you are building so high building? What is the reason?'' and if I answer, "Just to set fire it it,'' then the..., the man will laugh: "You, simply for setting fire, you are spending so much money and building this high building for setting fire?'' "Yes.'' 
So this sort of answer is just like in our present activities. Now, of course, you take the dead bodies to the crematorium and, I mean to say, put into the grave. But India... In India, of course, there is graveyard for the Muhammadans and the Christians, but the Hindus, they burn the dead body. They burn the dead body. You see? In the Bhägavata also, these three system are recorded, that the ultimate transformation of this body will be either ashes, stool or earth.
Woman: Earth...
Prabhupäda: Earth...
Woman: ...stool...
Prabhupäda: ...stool or ashes. How it is? Now, because after death, persons who burn the dead body, that is turned into ashes. This body, this beautiful body, will be turned into ashes. And those who bury in the graveyard, that will turn into... 
[aside:] Oh, that is air. Don't disturb yourself. That is the air. 
If we bury in the ground, gradually the body will turn into earth. And according to Iranian system, the body is thrown to the vultures. They eat it. So that will be turned into animal stool. You see? So that is the last stage of this body. 
So everyone knows that everyone will die. Still, we are working so hard. We are making our bank balance, we are just making will and papers just to give protection to our family or to our children, and there is no time. Everyone is very busy in this. But he does not see that "All these, what I am doing, all these body ultimately become either ash or animal stool or turn into earth. So why I am taking so much trouble?" 
Therefore the revealed scripture advises that "You have to maintain your body. That's all right. But for simply material comforts you should not devote time more than it is absolutely required." That means don't increase your bodily necessities. Don't increase your bodily necessities. 
That was the standard of Indian civilization. They did not, the sages and saints, they did not advise to increase the necessities of the body. They, I mean to say, planned the social system in such a way that people should be satisfied only for..., by the bare necessities of life. We require some eating, we require some sleeping, or shelter place, and we require some sense gratification and we require some protection from enemies. 
[aside:] Yes? Come. Ah-hah! Ah, ah-hah, ah-hah! [indistinct name] Come in. Come in. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraëäravinda re. Bhaja, bhaja means worship; hu, hello; mana, mind. The poet Govinda däsa, a great philosopher and a devotee of the Lord, he is praying. He is requesting his mind, because mind is the friend and mind is the enemy of everyone. If one can train his mind in Kåñëa consciousness, then he is successful. If he cannot train his mind, then his life is failure. Therefore, Govinda däsa, a great devotee of Lord Kåñëa... His very name suggests, Govinda däsa. Govinda, Kåñëa, and däsa means servant. 
This is the attitude of all devotees. They always put, affix this däsa, means servant. So Govinda däsa is praying, “My dear mind, please you try to worship the son of Nanda, who is abhaya-caraëa, whose lotus feet is secure. There is no fear.” Abhaya. Abhaya means there is no fear, and caraëa, caraëa means lotus feet. So he is advising his mind, “My dear mind, please you engage yourself in worshiping the fearless lotus feet of the son of Nanda.” Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana. Nanda-nandana means a son of Nanda Mahäräja, Kåñëa. And His lotus feet is abhaya, fearless. So Govinda däsa is requesting his mind, “Please be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of Kåñëa.” 
So far other things are concerned... And he says also that durlabha mänava-janama. Durlabha means very rare to obtain. Mänava-janma means this human form of life. It comes after a very long rotation. Once chance is given to become Kåñëa conscious so that one may get out of the cycle of birth and death. Therefore he advises that this life, this human form of life, is very important, durlabha. Durlabha means... Duù means with great difficulty, and labha means obtainable. 
So foolish people, they do not know what, how much important this human form of life. They are simply wasting in sense gratification like animals. So this is very instructing, that he is training his mind that “You engage your mind in the worship of Lord Kåñëa.” Durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge. And this training of the mind is possible only in good association, sat-saìga. Sat-saìga means persons who are simply cent per cent engaged in the service of the Lord. They are called sat. Satäà prasaìgät. 
Without association of devotees, it is impossible to train the mind. It is not possible by the so-called yoga system or meditation. One has to associate with devotees; otherwise it is not possible. Therefore, we have formed this Kåñëa consciousness society so that one may take advantage of this association. So Govinda däsa, poet and devotee, is advising, durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge: “You have got this very nice, rare human body. Now associate with devotees and engage your mind on the fearless lotus feet of Kåñëa.” He is requesting his mind.
Then he is pointing out the frustration of life. What is that? Çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa e dina jäminé jägi re. Çéta means winter. Ätapa means summer, when there is scorching sunshine, ätapa. Çéta ätapa. Bäta, cold, bariñaëa, torrents of rain. So these disturbances are always there. Sometimes it is severe cold, sometimes it is scorching heat, sometimes there is torrents of rain, sometimes this or that is going on. 
So he says, çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa e dina jäminé jägi re. Whole day and night, people are working very hard without caring, severe cold, severe heat, and torrents of rain, and keeping night [duty], going to the desert, going underneath the sea—everywhere they are so busy. Çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa e dina jäminé jägi re. There is night duty and so many other engagements. So he says,
çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa
e dina jäminé jägi re
biphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana
capala sukha-laba lägi’ re
“Now, with all this hard labor, what I have done? I have served some persons who are not at all favorable to my Kåñëa consciousness. And why I have served them?” Capala sukha-laba lägi’ re. Capala, very flickering happiness. “I think if my small child smiles, I will be happy. I think if my wife is pleased, I think I am happy. But all this temporary smiling or feeling of happiness, they are all flickering.” That one has to realize. 
There are many other poets also similarly have sung that this is..., this mind is just like a desert, and it is hankering after oceans of water. In a desert, if a ocean is transferred, then it can be inundated. And what benefit can be achieved there if drop of water is there? Similarly, our mind, our consciousness, is hankering after ocean of happiness. And this temporary happiness in family life, in society life, they are just like drop of water. So those who are philosophers, those who have actually studied the world situation, they can understand that “This flickering happiness cannot make me happy.”
Then he says, kamala-dala-jala, jévana talamala. Kamala-dala-jala means the lily, lily flower. You have all seen lily flower on the lakes. They are tottering, always in the water. Tottering. Any way, any time, it can be overflooded. Similarly, this life is full of danger always, always in danger. Any moment it can be finished. There are so many instances. People look it, but they forget. That is the wonderful thing. They are seeing every day, every moment, that he is himself in danger, others are in danger. Still, he is thinking that “I am secure.’’ This is the position. 
So life is very tottering and in dangerous position. Therefore, one should take advantage of this human form of life and immediately engage in Kåñëa consciousness. That should be the request of everyone to his mind, “My dear mind, don’t drag me in the dangerous position. Please keep me in Kåñëa consciousness.’’ Thus Kåñëa consciousness, how it can be achieved, that is also being described by Govinda däsa. He says,
çravaëa, kértana, smaraëa, vandana,
päda-sevana, däsya re,
püjana, sakhé-jana, ätma-nivedana
govinda-däsa-abhiläña re
Abhiläña means aspiration, hope, or ambition. He is ambitious of becoming a devotee in nine different ways. The first thing is çravaëa. Çravaëa means hearing. One has to hear from authorities. That is the beginning of spiritual life or Kåñëa consciousness. Just like Arjuna. He achieved his spiritual consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness, by hearing from Kåñëa. Similarly, one has to hear from Kåñëa or from the representative of Kåñëa. One who presents Kåñëa’s words as it is—from him one has to hear because at the present moment we have no opportunity to hear directly. 
To hear directly from Kåñëa is there. The arrangement is there. Kåñëa is situated in everyone’s heart, and one can hear from Him very easily, anywhere and everywhere, but he must have the training how to hear. For that purpose one requires the help of the representative of Kåñëa. Therefore Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that one can achieve devotional service of Kåñëa by the combined mercy of Kåñëa and the spiritual master. Guru-kåñëa-kåpäya päya bhakti-latä-béja [Cc Madhya 19.151]. 
[”According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kåñëa. By the mercy of both Kåñëa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.]
By the grace of spiritual master, guru, and by the grace of Kåñëa, one achieves the opportunity of serving Kåñëa in devotional service. So in the Caitanya-caritämåta it is also said that spiritual master is the direct manifestation of Kåñëa. 
Kåñëa comes before the devotee as spiritual master just like sun enters your room by the sunshine. Although the sun does not enter your room or your city or your country—he is so many millions and millions of miles away—still, he can enter everywhere by his potency, the sunshine. Similarly, Kåñëa enters everywhere by His different potencies. And to receive this light from Kåñëa, one has to hear. Hearing is so important. Therefore Govinda däsa says, çravaëa. Çravaëa means hearing. And one who has heard nicely, his next stage will be kértanam. Just like our boys who have heard a little nicely, now they are very eager to chant, going from street to street. 
This is natural sequence. It is not that you hear, but you remain stopped. No. The next stage will be kértanam. Either by chanting vibration or by writing or by speaking or by preaching, the kértana will be there. So çravaëaà kértanam, first hearing and then chanting. And hearing and chanting about whom? About Viñëu, not for any nonsense. Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]. 
[Prahläda Mahäräja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viñëu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kåñëa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
These things are stated in the çästra. The ordinary people, they are also engaged in hearing and chanting. They are hearing in the newspaper of some politician, and the whole day they are discussing and chanting, “Oh, this man is going to be elected. This man is going to ...’’ 
So hearing and chanting is there everywhere. But if you want spiritual salvation, then you have to hear and chant about Viñëu, nobody else. Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù. So the poet sings, çravaëa, kértana, smaraëa, vandana, päda-sevana, däsya re. So there are different processes: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping in the temple, engaging oneself in the service. So he is desiring all nine kinds of devotional service. Ultimately, püjana sakhé-jana. Sakhé-jana means those who are confidential devotees of the Lord, to please them. And ätma-nivedana. Ätmä means self, and nivedana means surrender. Govinda-däsa-abhiläña. 
The poet’s name is Govinda däsa, and he expresses that his desires are only this. He wants to utilize the opportunity of his human form of life in this way. This is the sum and substance of this song.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana-abhaya caraëäravinda re. This is a song sung by Govinda däsa, poet Govinda däsa. He's addressing his mind, because, after all, we have to work with the cooperation of our mind. If our mind is disturbed, if the mind is dragging us to choose something else, then it is very difficult to concentrate in one sort of business. That is practical. Therefore the yoga system means to control the mind. It is a mechanical process of controlling the mind. 
Because without controlling the mind, without the mind being disturbed, without the mind being not disturbed, nobody can make any spiritual progress. But our Vaiñëava system is to engage the mind directly in devotional service so that it may not go outside the scope of devotional service. That is our system. And that is practical. If we concentrate our mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa, arcanam-çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù, smaraëaà päda-sevanam-päda-sevanam [SB 7.5.23], then automatically mind becomes controlled. 
[Prahläda Mahäräja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viñëu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kåñëa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
The yogis are trying artificially to control the mind, but they are failing. There are many instances big, big yogis fail. So anything done artificially is not possible to be perfectly done. Therefore the system of controlling the mind means you give the mind better engagement, then mind will not be attracted by inferior energy. This is the science or secret of success.
So Govinda däsa is trying to fix up the mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa which is known as abhaya-caraëa. Abhaya means "where there is no fear.'' Just like we deposit our money in a reliable bank because we think there is no fear of loss. That is called abhaya, "without any fear,'' and caraëa means "lotus feet.'' 
So Govinda däsa is advising his mind, hü re mana "My dear mind,'' hü re addressing the mind. Bhaja hü re mana. Bhaja. Bhaja means "be engaged in devotional service.'' Bhaja hü re mana çré-nanda-nandana, "in the service of Kåñëa, the son of Nanda.'' There are many, many Kåñëas, but we are concerned with the particular Kåñëa who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja and the son of Väsudeva. Therefore he says particularly just like we identify one person his name, his father's name, then it is perfectly identified. 
So, he says çré nanda-nandana; bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana abhaya-caraëäravinda re, "His Lotus Feet is secure to take shelter of.'' There are many çlokas in the Bhägavatam about this: samäçritä ye pada-pallava-plavam mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù [SB 10.14.58]. 
[For those who have accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Muräri, the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoof-print. Their goal is paraà padam, Vaikuëöha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.]
Mahat-padam, "Under the Lotus Feet of Kåñëa, the whole material creation is resting.'' So if such a gigantic creation can rest, so if I am insignificant tiny living being, if I take shelter at the Lotus Feet, which is fearless, of Kåñëa, then my security is guaranteed. Bhajahü re mana çré-nanda-nandana, abhaya caraëä-ravinda re, durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge, taroho e bhava-sindhu re. Durlabha, "very rarely got this human form of life.'' Durlabha mänava-janama. 
So in order to fix up our mind on the Lotus Feet of Kåñëa, it is necessary that we should live in the association of devotees. Durlabha mänava-janama sat-saìge. Sat-saìge means "in the association of devotees.'' If we don't live in the association of devotees, if we try to fix up our mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa independently, it will be not possible. It will be failure. Therefore he says sat-saìge, "in the association of devotees." Taroho e bhava-sindhu re, "the real purpose of life is to cross over the ocean of nescience.'' 
So if we fix up our mind on the Lotus Feet of Kåñëa in the association of devotees, then we can very easily cross over the ocean of nescience, the material existence. Then, what is my present business? Now my present business is: çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa, e dina jäminé jägi re. My material engagement is that "I don't care for severe cold, I don't care for scorching heat, I don't care for sleeping at night; I am working hard day and night.'' 
Çéta ätapa bäta bariñaëa, e dina jäminé jägi re. And what for? Kåpaëa, bhipale sevinu kåpaëa durajana, "for the service of kåpaëa dura-jana.'' Kåpaëa durajana means outsiders. The so-called material society, friendship, love, etc., they are actually outsiders. They can not give me actual spiritual advancement of life. But we are engaged in the service of society, friendship, or love, nationalism, socialism, so many. 
Our engagements are various, but that is biphale. Biphale means "without any result.'' Result will be that I create a certain type of mentality in order to protect the so-called country, society, family, and at the time of death I will have to accept a body according to my mentality. So people are accepting so many abominable means to carry on this business of society, friendship, and love, so-called. The result is that he is developing a certain type of mentality which is not human, and the result will be next life he'll be forced to accept a body according to that mentality. 
Therefore kåpaëa durajana. Kåpaëa means "miser.'' They'll not give me any intelligence, any enlightenment of my real need of life, but still we are engaged in the service of such durajana, "outsider.'' Biphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana, capala sukha-laba lägi' re, and there is little happiness. Otherwise, how a man can work so hard day and night. The happiness is sex enjoyment, capala, "flickering.'' 
Vidyapati sings, tatala saikate vari bindu-sama, "That happiness is just like a drop of water in the desert.'' Desert requires water but if you take little water and sprinkle over it, "Now take water,'' so what is the value of that water? Similarly, we are hankering after eternal happiness, what these society, friendship and love will give us? 
Therefore we are simply wasting our time in the matter of deriving happiness from this so-called materialistic way of life maintaining society, friendship and so forth, simply wasting. Biphale. Biphale means "without any good result.'' Biphale sevinu kåpaëa durajana, capala sukha-laba lägi' re. "Never mind, I shall enjoy personally. I've got my youthful life, I can earn money, and I don't care for my family.'' 
Actually this is now happening at the present moment. Nobody cares for family, but he is busy only for maintaining himself, to utilize his youthful life, and so many things. Govinda Däsa poet is advising, "My dear mind, I accept that now you have got youthful life, you can enjoy.'' Therefore, you say e dhana yaubana putra parijana, ithe ki äche paratéti re, "this accumulation of wealth: earning money; and this youthful life: enjoying.'' 
E dhana yaubana putra parijana, and by society, friendship and love, do you think is there any actual happiness or transcendental happiness? Ithe ki äche paratéti re, "It is something like the water on the lotus leaf.'' Kamala-dala-jala, jévana öalamala, "It is this existence of water is tiltering, at any moment will fall down.'' Actually, all of this youthful enjoyment or money-making business, at any moment it can be finished. So actually you can not believe or bring your faith in that sort of happiness. That is not good because it can be finished at any moment. These people are engaged in making skyscraper buildings, and bank balance, and having good motorcars, and so many things they are trying to enjoy, but forgetting that any moment it can be finished. Any moment. 
So it is just like kamala-dala-jala, "keeping water on the lotus leaf.'' It does not stand, it is tilted, can fall down, any moment. The example is very nice. Therefore he's advising, çravaëa kértana, he is instructing the mind that, "don't do this, don't do this,'' so many negative things. Then the next question will be then actually, mind may ask Govinda Däsa, "Actually what do you want to do? You are negativating all these material engagements that's all right, then what is your positive proposal?'' He says, "Yes, my positive proposal is this: çravaëa kértana smaraëa vandana, päda-sevana däsya re, püjana sakhé-jana ätma-nivedana, govinda däsa-abhiläña re." "My dear mind, my desire is that you kindly help me hearing about this abhaya-caraëäravinda, Kåñëa, çravaëa. 
And let me chant about His glories, çravaëa kértana. Let me remember, let me serve His Lotus Feet, let me make friendship with Him. Offer, let me offer everything what have I got to Him. These are my desires. If you kindly cooperate with me, and then I can do this.'' So this is a very instructive song, the summary of the mission of human life, and anyone who will follow this principle will be actually happy transcendentally.

taträsyäù kleça-ghnatvam-
Relief from material distress-
(1.1.18)
kleças tu päpaà tad-béjam

Sinful reactions are explained thus-
(1.1.19)
aprärabdhaà bhavet päpaà
prärabdhaà ceti tad dvidhä

In connection with the destruction of potential sinful reactions, there is the following statement in the Eleventh Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:

yathägniù susamåddhärciù
karoty edhäàsi bhasmasät
tathä mad-viñayä bhaktir

[As all fuel is burned to ashes by a full-fledged fire, all sinful activities are totally erased when one engages in devotional service to Me.] 
prärabdha-haratvaà yathä tåtéye (SB 3.33.6)-
The destruction of manifest sinful reactions is described in the Third Canto as follows:

[To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.]
(1.1.22)

'yogyatve käraëaà matam

aprärabdha-phalaà päpaà
küöaà béjaà phalonmukham
krameëaiva praléyeta
viñëu-bhakti-ratätmanäm
[There are different stages of dormant reactions to sinful activities to be observed in a sinful life. Sinful reactions may be just waiting to take effect [phalonmukha], reactions may be still further dormant [küöa], or the reactions may be in a seedlike state [béja]. In any case, all types of sinful reactions are vanquished one after another if a person engages in the devotional service of Lord Viñëu.]
béja-haratvaà yathä ñañöhe (SB 6.2.17)-
In the Sixth Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam the removal of seedlike sinful desires is described:
(1.1.24)
tais täny aghäni püyante
tapo-däna-vratädibhiù
nädharmajaà tad-dhådayaà
tad apéçäìghri-sevayä
[Although one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows and other such methods, these pious activities cannot uproot the material desires in one's heart. However, if one serves the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, he is immediately freed from all such contaminations.]
avidyä-haratvaà yathä caturthe [SB 4.22.39]-
The destruction of ignorance is described in the Fourth Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as follows:

karmäçayaà grathitam udgrathayanti santaù
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo 'pi ruddha-
sroto-gaëäs tam araëaà bhaja väsudevam
[The devotees, who are always engaged in the service of the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, can very easily overcome hard-knotted desires for fruitive activities. Because this is very difficult, the nondevotees-the jïänés and yogés-although trying to stop the waves of sense gratification, cannot do so. Therefore you are advised to engage in the devotional service of Kåñëa, the son of Vasudeva.]
pädme ca-
In the Padma Puräëa it is also said:
(1.1.26)
kåtänuyäträ vidyäbhir
hari-bhaktir anuttamä
avidyäà nirdahaty äçu
däva-jväleva pannagém
[Pure devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness is the highest enlightenment, and when such enlightenment is there, it is just like a blazing forest fire, killing all the inauspicious snakes of desire.]

tatra jagat-préëanädi-dvaya-pradatvaà, yathä pädme-
In connection with making the whole world happy and being affectionate toward all living entities, the following statement is found in the Padma Puräëa:
(1.1.28)
yenärcito haris tena
tarpitäni jaganty api
rajyanti jantavas tatra
jaìgamäù sthävarä api
[A person who is engaged in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness is to be understood to be doing the best service to the whole world and to be pleasing everyone in the world. In addition to human society, he is pleasing even the trees and animals, because they also become attracted by such activities.]
sad-guëädi-pradatvaà yathä païcame (SB 5.18.12)-
How godly qualities are developed by devotional service is described in the Fifth Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:
(1.1.29)
yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä
sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù
haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëä
manorathenäsati dhävato bahiù
[All the demigods and their exalted qualities, such as religion, knowledge and renunciation, become manifest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?]
sukha-pradatvaà-
Devotional service as giver of happiness -
(1.1.30)
sukhaà vaiñayikaà brähmam
aiçvaraà ceti tat tridhä
[Happiness from material enjoyment, happiness from identification with Brahman and happiness derived from Kåñëa consciousness, are the three categories of happiness.]

As stated by Lord Çiva in the tantra-çästra-
(1.1.31)

bhaved govinda-bhaktitaù
[My dear wife, a person who has surrendered himself at the lotus feet of Govinda and who has thus developed pure Kåñëa consciousness can be very easily awarded all the perfections desired by the impersonalists; and beyond this, he can enjoy the happiness achieved by the pure devotees.]
hari-bhakti-sudhodaye ca-
In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya Prahläda Mahäräja prays to Lord Nåsiàhadeva-
(1.1.32)
bhüyo 'pi yäce deveça 
tvayi bhaktir dåòhästu me
yä mokñänta catur-varga-
phaladä sukhadä latä
[My dear Lord, I repeatedly pray unto Your lotus feet that I may simply be stronger in devotional service. I simply pray that my Kåñëa consciousness may be more strong and steady, because happiness derived out of Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service is so powerful that with it one can have all the other perfections of religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and even the attainment of liberation from material existence.]
mokña-laghutä-kåt-
Devotional service minimizes the importance of liberation-
(1.1.33)
manäg eva prarüòhäyäà
hådaye bhagavad-ratau
puruñärthäs tu catväras
tåëäyante samantataù
[When even a little attachment to Kåñëa arises in a person's heart, then religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation become as insignificant as straw.]
yathä närada-païcaratre-
In the Närada Païcarätra it is stated:
(1.1.34)
hari-bhakti-mahä-devyäù
sarvä mukhyädi siddhayaù
bhuktayaç cädbhutäs tasyäç
ceöikävad anuvratäù
[The wonderful pleasures derived from the main mystic perfections are afraid of Hari-bhakti-mahä-devé, pure devotional service to Lord Hari, and they become her faithful attendants.]
sudurlabhä-
Devotional service is rarely achieved-
(1.1.35)
sädhanaughair anäsaìgair
alabhyä suciräd api
hariëä cäçv adeyeti
dvidhä sä syät sudurlabhä
[Devotional perfection is very difficult to attain for two reasons. First, unless one is attached to Kåñëa, he cannot attain devotional perfection even if he renders devotional service for a long time. Second, Kåñëa does not easily deliver perfection in devotional service.]
taträdyä, yathä tantre-
The exalted position of devotional service is described in the tantra-çästra-
(1.1.36)
jïänataù su-labhä muktir
bhuktir yajïädi-puëyataù
seyaà sädhana-sähasrair
häri-bhaktiù su-durlabhä
[By cultivating philosophical knowledge one can understand his spiritual position and thus be liberated, and by performing sacrifices and pious activities one can achieve sense gratification in a higher planetary system, but the devotional service of the Lord is so rare that even by executing hundreds and thousands of such sacrifices one cannot obtain it.]
dvitéyä yathä païcama skandhe (SB 5.6.18)-
This is further supported by the following statement in the Fifth Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam—
(1.1.37)
räjan patir gurur alaà bhavatäà yadünäà
daivaà priyaù kula-patiù kva ca kiìkaro vaù
astv evam aìga bhagavän bhajatäà mukundo
muktià dadäti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam
[Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: My dear King, the Supreme Person, Mukunda, is actually the maintainer of all the members of the Päëòava and Yadu dynasties. He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the Lord's favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to render direct service unto Him.]
sändränanda-viçeñätmä yathä-
The happiness of becoming one with the Supreme-
(1.1.38)
brahmänando bhaved eña
cet parärdha-guëé-kåtaù
naiti bhakti-sukhämbhodheù
paramäëu-tuläm api
[If brahmänanda, the transcendental bliss derived from understanding impersonal Brahman, were multiplied a million times, such a quantity of brahmänanda could not compare with even an atomic portion of the pleasure relished in pure devotional service.]
yathä hari-bhakti-sudhodaye-
In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya, Prahläda Mahäräja prays to Lord Nåsiàhadeva as follows:
(1.1.39)
tvat-säkñät-karaëähläda-
viçuddhäbdhi-sthitasya me
sukhäni goñpadäyante
brähmäëy api jagad-guro
[My dear Lord, O master of the universe, since I have directly seen You, my transcendental bliss has taken the shape of a great ocean. Being situated in that ocean, I now realize all other so-called happiness to be like the water contained in the hoofprint of a calf.]
Çrédhara Svämé, in his Bhävärtha-dépikä commentary to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, (SB 10.87.21), writes:
(1.1.40)
tvat-kathämåta-päthodhau
viharanto mahä-mudaù
kurvanti kåtinaù kecic
catur-vargaà tåëopamam
[For those who take pleasure in the transcendental topics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the four progressive realizations of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, all combined together, cannot compare, any more than a straw, to the happiness derived from hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord.]
çré-kåñëa-karñiëé-
Attracting Kåñëa-
(1.1.41)
kåtvä harià prema-bhäjaà
priya-varga-samanvitam
bhaktir vaçékarotéti
çré-kåñëa-karñiëé matä
[Bhakti, devotional service, is known as çré-kåñëa-karñiëé, which means that she fully controls Kåñëa in so many ways, through the influence of love.]
yathäikädeçe (SB 11.14.20)-
As stated in the Eleventh Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam—
(1.1.42)
na sädhayati mäà yogo
na säìkhyaà dharma uddhava
na svädhyäyas tapas tyägo
yathä bhaktir mamorjitä
[[The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, said:] 'My dear Uddhava, neither through añöäìga-yoga [the mystic yoga system to control the senses], nor through impersonal monism or an analytical study of the Absolute Truth, nor through study of the Vedas, nor through practice of austerities, nor through charity, nor through acceptance of sannyäsa can one satisfy Me as much as one can by developing unalloyed devotional service unto Me.]
saptame ca näradoktau (SB 7.10.48)-
And in the Seventh Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Närada Muni says-
(1.1.43)
yüyaà nå-loke bata bhüri-bhägä
lokaà punänä munayo 'bhiyanti
yeñäà gåhän ävasatéti säkñäd
güòhaà paraà brahma manuñya-liìgam
[Närada Muni continued: My dear Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, all of you [the Päëòavas] are extremely fortunate, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, lives in your palace just like a human being. Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house.]
(1.1.44)
agrato vakñyamänäyäs

[At the beginning of this book, the greatness of devotional service, bhakti, has been glorified by describing these six uncommon characteristics listed above. Bhakti can be divided into three categories, with each successive category having two more qualities than the previous one.]

Furthermore-
(1.1.45)
svalpäpi rucir eva syäd 
bhakti-tattvävabodhikä
yuktis tu kevalä naiva
yad asyä apratiñöhatä
[If a person has even a little taste for understanding devotional service, the revealed scriptures will bring him nearer to the truth of bhakti. But for one who is only interested in speculating and book knowledge and who does not engage in practical service, understanding will never be conclusive.]
tathä präcénair apy uktam-
In the words of the ancient sages—
(1.1.46)
yatnenäpädito 'py arthaù
kuçalair anumätåbhiù
abhiyuktatarair anyair
anyathaivopapädyate
[Whatever meaning has been ascertained with great endeavor by expert logicians, it is found to be inconsistent by those who have even greater erudition.]

präkaöyaà hådi sädhyatä
[When transcendental devotional service by which love for Kåñëa is attained is executed by the senses, it is called sädhana-bhakti, or the regulative discharge of devotional service.

(1.2.6)
yatra rägän aväptatvät
pravåttir upajäyate

sä vaidhé bhaktir ucyate

vismartavyo na jätucit
sarve vidhi-niñedhäù syur

puruñasyäçramaiù saha
catväro jajïire varëä
guëair viprädayaù påthak
[From the mouth of Brahmä, the brahminical order has come into existence. Similarly, from his arms the kñatriyas have come, from his waist the vaiçyas have come, and from his legs the çüdras have come.

saiva bhaktir iti proktä

[Any activities sanctioned in the revealed scriptures and aiming at the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are accepted by saintly teachers as the regulative principles of devotional service.

piçäcé hådi vartate
tävad bhakti-sukhasyätra
katham abhyudayo bhavet
[The material desire to enjoy the material world and the desire to become liberated from material bondage are considered to be two witches, and they haunt one like ghosts. As long as these witches remain within the heart, how can one feel transcendental bliss? As long as these two witches remain in the heart, there is no possibility of enjoying the transcendental bliss of devotional service.]

Forgetting You

bhuliyä tomäre, saàsäre äsiyä,
peye nänä-vidha byathä
tomära caraëe, äsiyächi ämi,
bolibo duùkhera kathä
[O Lord, having forgotten You and come to this material world, I have experienced a host of sins and sorrows. Now I approach Your lotus feet and submit my tale of woe.]
janané jaöhare, chiläma jakhona,
biñama bandhana-päçe
eka-bära prabhu! dekhä diyä more,
vaïcile e déna däse
[While I was bound up tightly in the unbearable confines of my mother’s womb, O Lord, You once revealed Yourself before me. After appearing briefly, You abandoned this poor servant of Yours.]
takhona bhävinu, janama päiyä,
koribo bhajana tava
janama hoilo, paòi' mäyä-jäle,
nä hoilo jïäna-lava
[At that moment I thought, “After my birth this time, I will surely worship You with undivided attention.” But alas, after taking birth I fell into the entangling network of worldly illusions; thus I possessed not even a drop of true knowledge.]
ädarera chele, sva-janera kole,
häsiyä käöänu käla
janaka janané-snehete bhuliyä,
saàsära lägilo bhälo
[As a dear son fondled in the laps of attentive relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. The affection of my father and mother helped me forget You still more, and I began to think that the material world was a very nice place.]
krame dina dina, bälaka hoiyä,
bhelinu bälaka-saha
ära kichu dine, jnäna upajilo,
päöha poòi ahar-ahaù
[Day by day I gradually grew into a young boy and began playing with other boys. Soon my powers of understanding emerged, so I diligently studied my school lessons every day.]
vidyära gaurave, bhrami' deçe deçe,
dhana uparjana kori
sva-jana pälana, kori eka-mane,
bhulinu tomäre, hari!
[Proud of my accomplished education, I later traveled from place to place and earned much wealth. Thereby maintaining my family with undivided attention, I forgot You, O Lord Hari!]
bärdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda,
käëdiyä kätara ati
nä bhajiyä tore, dina båthä gelo,
ekhona ki have gati?
[Now in old age, this Bhaktivinoda very sadly weeps as death approaches. I failed to worship You, O Lord, and instead passed my days in vain. What will be my fate now?]

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This is a song sung by Bhaktivinode Öhäkura as the surrendering process. We have heard so much about surrender. So here are some of the songs how one can make surrender. So Bhaktivinode Öhäkura says that bhuliyä tomäre, saàsäre äsiyä, “My dear Lord, I have come to this material world by forgetting Lords. And since I have come here, I have suffered so many troubles since long, long time through different species of life. So, therefore, I have come to surrender unto You and submit unto You the story of my sufferings. First thing is that I had to live within the womb of my mother.” 
Janané jaöhare, chiläma jakhona. “When I was there, compact, packed up in an airtight bag, hands and legs, I was staying within the womb of my mother. At that time, I had a glimpse of You. After that time, I could not see You. At that time I could see You, a glimpse. At that time I thought,” takhona bhävinu, janama päiyä, “I thought that this time when I get out of this womb, I shall surely engage cent per cent in the service of the Lord, worshiping the Lord. No more this repetition of birth and death, is so troublesome. 
Now I shall engage, this birth I shall engage myself simply on devotional service to get out of this mäyä. But unfortunately, exactly after my birth,” janama hoilo, paòi’ mäyä-jäle, nä hoilo jïäna-lava, “as soon as I got out of the womb, immediately mäyä, the illusory energy, captured me and I forgot that I was in such precarious condition, and I was crying and praying to the Lord that this time I shall get out and engage myself in devotional service. But all these senses were lost as soon as I took my birth.” Then the next stage is ädarera chele, sva-janera kole. “Then I become a very pet child and everyone is taking me on the lap, and I thought, ’Life is very nice, everyone loves me.’ Then I thought, ’This material life is very good.’” 
Ädarera chele, sva-janera kole, häsiyä käöänu käla. “Because there is no trouble. As soon as I am in little difficulty, everyone comes forward to give me relief. So I thought my life will go on like this. So I simply wasted my time simply by smiling, and that smiling became attractive to my relatives and they patted me. I thought, ’This is the life.’” Janaki...janaka janané-snehete bhuliyä, saàsära lägilo. “At that time, a great deal of affection of parents. So I thought material life is very nice.” 
Krame dina dina, bälaka hoiyä, khelinu bälaka-saha. “Then gradually I grew up and I began to play with my childhood friends, and it was very nice life. And after some days, when I was little intelligent, then I was put into school. So I began to study very seriously. Then after that,” vidyära gaurave, bhrami’ deçe deçe, dhana uparjana kori. “Then being puffed up...” Bhaktivinode Öhäkura was magistrate. So he was transferred from one place to another. He is stating his life, that vidyära gaurave, “Because I was little educated, so I was posted and I was earning decently. So I was thinking, ’It is very nice.’” 
Vidyära gaurave, bhrami’ deçe deçe, dhana uparjana kori. Swa-jana pälana, kori eka-mane, “And only duty was how to maintain, how to raise family members, how to keep them happy. That became my only aims and object of life.” Bärdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda. Now Bhaktivinode Öhäkura, in his old age, käëdiyä kätara ati, “Now I am seeing that I will have to give up all this arrangement, I will have to go away and take another body. Therefore, I do not know what kind of body I am going to get. Therefore, I am crying, I am very much aggrieved.” 
Bärdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda, käëdiyä kätara ati, “I am very much aggrieved.” Nä bhajiyä tore, dina båthä gelo, ekhona ki. “So without worshiping You, without serving You, I have simply wasted my time in this way. I do not know what to do. Therefore, I surrender.”

"Who is a Real Vaiñëava?"

(1)
duñöa mana! tumi kiser vaiñëava?
pratiñöhär tare, nirjaner ghare,
tava 'hari-näma' kevala 'kaitava'
[O wicked mind! What kind of Vaiñëava do you think you are? Your pretentious show of chanting Lord Hari's holy name in a solitary place is only for the sake of attaining the false prestige of a worldly reputation—it is nothing but pure hypocrisy.]
(2)
jaòer pratiñöhä, çukarer viñöhä,
jäno nä ki tähä 'mäyär vaibhava'
kanaka käminé, divasa-yäminé,
bhäviyä ki käja, anitya se saba
[Such materialistic prestige is as disgusting as the stool of a hog. Do you not know that it is only a mere illusion cast by the potency of Mäyä? What is the value of contemplating day and night your plans for enjoying wealth and women? All these things are only temporary.]
(3)
tomär kanaka, bhoger janaka,
kanaker dväre sevaho 'mädhava'
käminér käma, nahe tava dhäma,
tähär-mälika kevala 'yädava'
[When you claim wealth as your own, it creates in you ever-increasing desires for material enjoyment. Your riches should be used for serving Mädhava, the Lord of all wealth. Neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust for women, whose only true proprietor is Lord Yädava.]
(4)
pratiñöhäçä-taru, jaòa-mäyä-maru,
nä pela 'rävaëa' yujhiyä 'räghava'
vaiñëavé pratiñöhä, täte koro niñöhä,
tähä nä bhajile labhibe raurava
[The demon Rävaëa (lust-incarnate) fought with Lord Rämachandra (love-incarnate) in order to gain the tree of worldly reputation-but that oasis turned out to be but a mirage cast in the desert wasteland of the Lord's illusory material potency. Please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and solid platform whereupon a Vaiñëava ever stands. If you neglect worshiping the Lord from this position, then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence.]
(5)
harijana-dveña, pratisthäçä-kleça,
koro keno tabe tähär gaurava
vaiñëaver päche, pratisthäçä äche,
tä'te kabhu nähe 'anitya-vaibhava'
[Why do you needlessly suffer the torment of blaspheming the devotees of Lord Hari, attempting to achieve their eminence, thereby only proving your own fruitless foolishness? The desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one becomes a devotee of the Lord, for eternal fame automatically follows the heels of a Vaiñëava. And that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly opulence.]

The Treasure Trove of Pure Love of God 

(1)
gaurä pahu nä bhajiyä goinu

(2)
adhane ylsvatana kari dhana teyäginu
äpana karama-doñe äpani òubinu
[Although being quite in need of wealth, I have still worked very hard to reject the great opportunity of receiving Your riches. Then I submerged myself in the ocean of sinful reactions.]
(3)
sat-saìga chäòi' kainu asate viläsa
te-käraëe lägilo ye karma-bandha-phäìsa
[Avoiding the association of saintly persons, I sported merrily in the company of materialistic rascals. For that reason I have become strung up in the noose of my own fruitive activities.]
(4)
viñaya-viñama-viña satata khäinu

[I perpetually drank the horrible poison of mundane sense gratification, having never absorbed myself in the divine mellows of the kértan glorifying Lord Gaura.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Gaura pahü nä bhajiyä goinu, prema-rathana-dhana heläya häräiìu. This is another song by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. He's saying that "I have invited my spiritual death by not worshiping Lord Caitanya." Gaura pahü nä bhajiyä goinu. Gaura pahü means "Lord Caitanya," and nä bhajiyä, "without worshiping." Goinu, "I have invited spiritual death." And adhame yatane kari dhanu tainu. "Why I have invited the spiritual death? Because I am engaged in something which is useless and I have rejected the real purpose of my life."
Adhama means valueless things. And dhana means valuables. So actually, everyone of us, neglecting our spiritual emancipation, we are engaged in material sense gratification, and therefore we are losing the opportunity of this human form of body to elevate myself on the spiritual platform. This human body is especially given to the conditioned soul to take a chance for spiritual emancipation. So anyone who does not care for spiritual emancipation, he is inviting spiritual death. Spiritual death means to forget oneself, that he's spirit. That is spiritual death. 
So in the animal life it is fully forgetfulness. They cannot be reminded at any circumstances that they are not this body, they are different from this body. It is only in this human form of body, human form of life, one can understand that he is not this body, he's spirit soul. So by chanting Hare Kåñëa, one can easily understand this fact, and by worshiping Lord Caitanya, following His principles and ways, one can chant Hare Kåñëa and very easily come to the platform of spiritual understanding. But Narottama däsa Öhäkura says on our behalf that we are neglecting this. Therefore we are inviting spiritual death.
Then he says that prema-rathana-dhana heläya häräiìu. Spiritual life means to develop real love. Everyone says love. There are so many signboards, so many papers, "love, love." But there is no love. This is illusion. It is all lust. Love for intoxication, love for sex, love for this... This is going on. So actual love means... Love, this word, can be applicable only with Kåñëa, with God. Because we are created for that purpose. To love means to love Kåñëa. So that is wanted. That is spiritual love. 
So prema-rathana. I could achieve that transcendental position of love, but I am neglecting. Therefore I am calling my spiritual death. And these things are happening due to my past misdeeds. Due to my past deeds, misdeeds, I have got a type of body. Everyone who has got this material body, it is due to past misdeeds. Sometimes we call pious deeds. Actually, so long one gets this material body there is no pious deeds. Pious deeds means no more material body. That is pious deeds. Otherwise it is to be taken as a fact that even Brahmä, who is the chief living entity within this universe and has got a mass of years as duration of life, all power, still, that is also considered as misdeeds. Because he has got the material body.
So we are going deep down and down, one after another, body, by our misdeeds. In the Bhägavata also it is stated that they do not know that by this sense gratificatory process they will have another body. And the body is the cause of material pangs. Because I have got this body, therefore I feel headache, I feel stomachache. I feel this and that. But, as soon as we are out of this material body, there is no more material pangs. It is simply joyful life. Brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä [Bg 18.54]. 
[One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.]
Prasannätmä means joyful. As soon as one gets spiritual life. So due to my past deeds, I am missing this opportunity. Apana kara mada seva...
And why it is happening? Sat-saìga chäòi khainu asatyera viläsa. "I have given up the association of devotees, but I am associating with common nonsense men." Asatyera. Asat and sat. Sat means spirit. And asat means matter. So association of material attachment means implication in this material conditional life. So one has to make association with devotees. Satäà prasaìgän mama vérya-saàvido. One can understand about God only in association of devotees. 
Therefore we are advocating this Kåñëa consciousness movement, society. Actually, you'll find, one who comes to this society, by associating a few days, a few weeks, he becomes conscious and he comes forward for initiation and further advancement. So this association is very important. And those who are conducting different centers and temples, they should be very responsible men. Because everything will depend on their sincere activities and character. If they are insincere, then that will not be effective. One may come and associate with us, but if we are insincere, then it will be not be effective. But if the devotees are sincere, anyone who will come in contact with a devotee, he'll change. That is the secret.
Sat-saìga chäòi asatyera viläsa. And as soon as we give up the association of these devotees, immediately mäyä will catch me. Immediately. Mäyä is just side by side. As soon as we give up this company, mäyä says "Yes, come in my company." Without any company, nobody can remain neutral. That is not possible. He must associate with mäyä or Kåñëa. So everyone should be very much serious to keep association with devotees, with Kåñëa.
When we speak of Kåñëa, "Kåñëa" means Kåñëa with His devotees. Kåñëa is never alone. Kåñëa is with Rädhäräëé. Rädhäräëé is with the gopés. And Kåñëa is with the cowherd boys. We are not impersonalists. We do not see Kåñëa alone. Similarly, Kåñëa means with Kåñëa's devotees. So Kåñëa consciousness means to keep association with the devotees of Kåñëa. 
Viñaya viñama viña satata khäinu. And he says that "I have drunk always the most dangerous poison of sense gratification." Viñaya viñama viña. Viñaya means sense gratification. Eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. These are called... These four principles are called viñaya. And viñama means dangerously. And viña means poison. If one is simply engaged with these four principles of life, just like animals then it is to be supposed that he's simply drinking poison. That's all. 
Viñaya viñama satata khäinu. "I know this be poison, but I am so much intoxicated that I am drinking this poison every moment." Gaura-kértana-rase magana nä painu. "And I could not merge myself into the saìkértana movement started by Lord Caitanya." Oh, that is actually the fact. Those who are too much attached to materialistic way of life, or always drinking the poison of sense gratification, they are not attracted by the saìkértana movement.
So at the last, Narottama däsa Öhäkura is lamenting. He's representing ourself. If one comes to that point of lamentation, that is also very nice. He immediately becomes purified. Lamentation means purification. So he says, keno vä ächaya präëa kichu bali... "Why I am living? I do not make association with the devotees. I do not take part in the saìkértana movement. I do not understand what is Kåñëa. I do not understand what is Lord Caitanya. Then what for I am living?" 
This is lamentation. "What is my happiness? What is the standard of my happiness? Why I am living?" Narottama däsa kena nä gela. "Why I did not die long, long ago? I should have died. What is the meaning of my living?" So it is not Narottama däsa Öhäkura's lamentation. Everyone of us should think like that, that "If we cannot make association with devotees, if we do not understand what is Kåñëa consciousness movement, if we do not come in touch with Lord Caitanya and associates, it was better for me to die. And there is no other remedy."

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This song was sung by Narottama däsa Öhäkura, a great devotee-äcärya in the disciplic succession of Gauòéya Vaiñëava Sampradäya. Gauòéya Vaiñëava Sampradäya means the disciplic succession who are coming down from Lord Caitanya. So this Narottama däsa Öhäkura has written many songs, and it is recognized as authority by all the Vaiñëavas. He has sung the songs in simple Bengali language, but the purport and the deep meaning of the song is very significant. 
He says: gauräìga bolite habe pulaka-çaréra. This is the perfection of chanting, that as soon as we chant or take the name of Lord Gauräìga, who initiated the Saìkértana Movement, at once there will be a shivering in the body. So it is not to be imitated. But Narottama däsa Öhäkura is recommending when that opportune moment will come to us, that as soon as we shall chant Lord Gauräìga’s name, there will shivering in the body. And, after the shivering, hari hari bolite nayane ba’be nér, by chanting Hare Kåñëa there will be tears in the eyes. Then again he says, ära kabe nitäicand koruëä karibe. We are all asking about the mercy of Lord Nityänanda. 
Nityänanda is supposed to be the original spiritual master. So we have to approach Gauräìga, or Lord Caitanya, through the mercy of Lord Nityänanda. So what is the symptom of a person who has achieved the causeless mercy of Lord Nityänanda? Narottama däsa Öhäkura says that one who has actually received the causeless mercy of Nityänanda, he has no more any material desire. That is the symptom. Ära kabe nitäicand koruëä karibe saàsära-väsanä mora kabe tuccha. Saàsära-väsanä means desire for material enjoyment, when it will become very insignificant. Of course, so long we have got this body we have to accept so many things, material. But not in the spirit of enjoyment, but to keep up the body and soul together. 
So... and he says further: rüpa-raguëatha-pade haibe äkuti. When I shall be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvämés. Äkuti means eagerness. Because Rüpa Gosvämé is the father of this devotional service. He has written that book, Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu. In that book there is nice direction. Of course, in Caitanya-caritämåta and other books, we have given the summary of those direction in our book, Teachings of Lord Caitanya. 
So one has to learn the conjugal loving affairs of Rädhä-Kåñëa through the teachings of these Six Gosvämés. Narottama däsa Öhäkura giving us the direction that you do not try to understand the conjugal love of Rädhä-Kåñëa by your own endeavor. You should try to understand by the direction of the Gosvämés. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura sings; 
rüpa-raghunätha-pade haibe äkuti
kabe häma bujhaba çré yugala-périti
[Prärthanä 1.3–4]
[When shall I be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvämés, headed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé and Çréla Raghunätha Däsa Gosvämé? By their instructions I shall be able to properly understand the loving affairs of Rädhä and Kåñëa.]
Yugala-périti means conjugal love. And another he sings that viñaya chäåiyä kabe çuddha ha’be mana. This mind, so long the mind is too much absorbed in materialistic thought, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Våndävana. Narottama däsa Öhäkura says: viñaya chäåiyä kabe çuddha ha’be mana. 
When my mind will be completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires. Then I shall be able to understand what is Våndävana, what is conjugal love of Rädhä and Kåñëa, and then my spiritual life will be successful.

When will that day come?

This is a song sung by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. He says, “When that day will come, that I shall sing simply Lord Caitanya’s name and there will be shivering on my body?” Gauräìga bolite habe pulaka-çaréra. Pulaka-çaréra means shivering on the body. When one is factually situated in the transcendental platform, sometimes there are eight kinds of symptoms: crying, talking like a madman, and shivering of the body, dancing without any care for any other men... 
These symptoms develop automatically. They are not practiced artificially. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura is aspiring for that day, not that one has to artificially imitate. That he does not recommend. He says, “When that day will come, so that simply by uttering the name of Lord Caitanya there will be a shivering on my body?” Gauräìga bolite habe pulaka-çaréra and hari hari bolite: “And as soon as I shall chant ’Hari Hari,’ or ’Hare Kåñëa,’ there will be pouring down of tears from my eyes.” 
Hari hari bolite nayane ba’be néra. Néra means water. Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu also said that “When that day will come?” We should simply aspire. But if, by Kåñëa’s grace, that stage we can reach, these symptoms will come automatically. But Narottama däsa Öhäkura says that it is not possible to reach that stage without being freed from material affection.
Therefore he says, ära kabe nitäi-cander, koruëä koribe: “When that day will come when Lord Nityänanda’s mercy will be bestowed upon me so that...’’ Viñaya chäriyä. Ära kabe nitäi-cander koruëä koribe, saàsära-bäsanä mora kabe tuccha ha’be. Saàsära-bäsanä means the desire for material enjoyment. Saàsära-bäsanä mora kabe tuccha ha’be: “When my desire for material enjoyment will be insignificant, nonimportant.’’ Tuccha. 
Tuccha means a thing which we calculate no value: “Throw it away.’’ Similarly, spiritual advancement is possible when one is convinced that “This material world and material happiness is no value. It cannot give me any real bliss of life.’’ This conviction is very much necessary. Saàsära-bäsanä mora kabe tuccha ha’be. And he also says that “When I shall be free from the desires of material enjoyment, then it will be possible to see the real nature of Våndävana.’’ 
Viñaya chäriyä kabe çuddha ha’be mana: “When my mind will be completely purified, uncontaminated from the material contamination, at that time it will be possible for me to see what is Våndävana.’’ In other words, one cannot go to Våndävana by force and live there, and he will achieve that transcendental bliss. No. One has to make his mind freed from all material desires. Then one can live at Våndävana and relish its residential benefit. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura says that viñaya chäriyä kabe, çuddha ha’be mana: “When my mind will be freed from the contamination of this material enjoyment and I shall be purified, then it will be possible for me to see Våndävana as it is.’’ Otherwise it is not possible.
And he says again that to go to Våndävana means to understand the transcendental pastimes of Rädhä and Kåñëa. How this will be possible? So he says, rüpa-raghunätha-pade hoibe äkuti. Rüpa, Rüpa Gosvämé, beginning from Rüpa Gosvämé down to Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé, there were Six Gosvämés: Rüpa, Sanätana, Gopäla Bhaööa, Raghunätha Bhaööa, Jéva Gosvämé, Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé. So he says, rüpa-raghunätha-pade: “Beginning from Rüpa Gosvämé down to Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé,” pade, “at their lotus feet. When I shall be eager to be attached at their lotus feet?” 
Rüpa-raghunätha-pade, hoibe äkuti. Äkuti, eagerness. What is that eagerness? That means to understand Rädhä-Kåñëa through the guidance of the Gosvämés. One should not try to understand Rädhä-Kåñëa by his own effort. That will not help him. As these Gosvämés, they have given us direction, just like Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, so one has to follow step after step how to make progress. Then there will be a fortunate day when we shall be able to understand what is the pastimes or loving affairs between Rädhä and Kåñëa. Otherwise, if we take it as ordinary boy and girl reciprocating their loving feelings, then we will misunderstand. Then there will be the production of prakåta-sahajiyä, victims of Våndävana.
So Narottama däsa Öhäkura is giving us the direction, how one can reach the highest perfectional stage of associating with Rädhä and Kåñëa. The first thing is that one should be very much attached to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. That will lead us. Because He came to deliver the understanding of Kåñëa consciousness, therefore one should first of all surrender to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. By surrendering to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Nityänanda Prabhu will be pleased. And by His pleasing, we shall be freed from material desires. And when material desires are no more, then we shall be able to enter Våndävana. And after entering Våndävana, when we are eager to serve the Six Gosvämés, then we can reach the platform to understand the pastimes of Rädhä and Kåñëa.

When will that day come?

'gauräìga' bolite habe pulaka-çaréra

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This nice song was sung by Narottama däsa Öhäkura, one of the great äcäryas of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava sampradäya. That is the sect of Vaiñëavism started by Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu. "Gauòéya" means belonging to Bengal. There are five Gauòa-deça in the northern part of India, out of which part of Bengal, West Bengal, is called Gauòa-deça. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura's songs are very appropriate just to the conclusion of Vedic injunctions. So he sings this song, how one can rise up to the transcendental plane for associating directly with Rädhä and Kåñëa, what is that process. 
The process is one should begin this Kåñëa consciousness under the mercy of Lord Caitanya. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Kåñëa Himself, and He is teaching people how to become Kåñëa consciousness. Lord Kåñëa, He [break] personally spoke about Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä, but people who are not very intelligent, who are described in the Bhagavad-gétä as müòha—müòha means rascal—and duñkåtina, and miscreant; and narädhama—
[break] narädhama means lowest of the mankind—such persons cannot understand Kåñëa. But still, Kåñëa was so merciful that in order to claim all these people, means the lowest of mankind, miscreant, and fools and rascals, rejected, so He came in the form of Lord Caitanya to reclaim them. 
So God is so merciful that even some persons cannot understand Him... First thing is people cannot understand actually what is God, but God comes Himself to explain Himself. Still, they commit mistake. Therefore Kåñëa comes as a devotee to teach us about Kåñëa consciousness. So we have to follow the footprints of Lord Caitanya. 
And Narottama däsa Öhäkura teaches that "First of all, try to chant the name of Gaurasundara." 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu-nityänanda
 çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda
[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
In this way, when we are a little bit attached with Gaurasundara, Lord Caitanya, then we automatically feel transcendental emotion. And that emotional stage is exhibited by shivering in the body. We should not, however, imitate such shivering to show to the public that "I have become a great devotee," but we should execute devotional service nicely and faithfully; then that stage will come automatically, shivering. 
As soon as one will chant the name of Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, there will be shivering. This is the first symptom that one is getting advanced in the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, gauräìga bolite habe pulaka çarére. He's expecting. Although he was a great äcärya, still, he was expecting, "When that stage will come?'' 
The wording of the song is as follows. G-a-u-r-a-n-g-a, gauräìga. Bolite, b-a-l-i-t-e. Habe, h-a-b-e. Gauräìga bolite habe pulaka, p-u-l-a-k-a. Pulaka çaréra, s-a-r-i-r. Gauräìga bolite habe pulaka çaréra hari hari, h-a-r-i h-a-r-i. Bolite, b-a-l-i-t-e. Hari hari bolite habe, h-a-b-e. Hari hari bolite kabe....  Not habe; kabe, k-a-b-e. Nayane, n-a-y-a-n-e. Ba'be, b-a-b-e. Néra, n-e-e-r. The meaning 
[break] that there will be not only shivering as soon as I utter the name of Gauräìga, but there will be torrents of tears in my eyes as soon as I chant Hare Kåñëa. This is the explanation.
The next line is ära kabe nitäi-cänder koruëä koribe. [spells out] Ära kabe nitäi-cänder koruëä koribe. This is also aspiration, that "When Nityänanda Prabhu, the constant associate of Lord Caitanya, will be pleased upon me?" Koruëä koribe. Koruëä koribe means "He will be pleased upon me." 
Nityänanda Prabhu, or Nitäicänd, is the original spiritual master. He is Baladeva. Bala means strength, and deva, the Personality of Godhead who gives strength. Therefore Nitäicänd is the symbol of spiritual master who gives strength to the disciples. This is the process of disciplic succession. 
We have to acquire the spiritual strength. No amount of material strength can help me in advancement of spiritual life. We must derive the spiritual strength. Just like we have to take electricity from the powerhouse by directly connecting with the powerhouse—not the wiring, but the electricity—similarly, this disciplic succession means the strength is descending from the original person through the spiritual master. That is the idea. 
So Narottama däsa Öhäkura explains that "When Nitäicänd will be pleased?" And the result of such pleasure of Nitäicänd is that one becomes free from all desires for material enjoyment.
ära kabe nitäi-cänd koruëä karibe
saàsära-bäsanä mora kabe tuccha ha'be
[spells out] So by the mercy of Nitäicänd, one will get free from all desires of material enjoyment.
The next line is viñaya chäòiyä kabe çuddha ha'be mana. [spells out] This kabe means "when," aspiring. Çuddha means "purified." Ha'be, "will be." Mana means "mind." So when actually our spiritual master or Nityänanda Prabhu is pleased upon us, at that time the symptom will be that we shall no longer hanker after material enjoyment. 
When that stage of life is arrived, at that time only, we can understand what is Våndävana, the abode of Kåñëa. Våndävana is not a material place, just like ordinary city or country. It is transcendental. So appreciation of Våndävana will be possible when our mind is free from all material desires, viñaya chäòiyä. 
Viñaya means eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are called viñaya. Viñaya means "objects." In the material world there are these four objects are in view: how I shall eat, how I shall sleep, how I shall mate, how I shall defend. So as soon as one is purified of all material desires, these material objectives will not be a problem.
viñaya chäòiyä kabe çuddha ha'be mana
kabe häma herabo çré-våndävana
So then we shall be able to understand what is Våndävana and what is kingdom of God, or Goloka Våndävana.
And the next stage is that one has to understand what is the loving affairs, conjugal love, between Rädhä and Kåñëa. And that will be possible if we carefully study the literatures left by the Gosvämés. Just like Rüpa Gosvämé has left behind him Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, Vidagdha-mädhava, Lalitä-mädhava. Many books, especially that Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu.
So,
viñaya chäòiyä kabe çuddha ha'be mana
kabe häma herabo çré-våndävana
rüpa-raghunätha-pade haibe äkuti...
[When will my mind become free from all material desires and anxieties? Only in that purified state will I be able to understand Våndävana and the conjugal love of Rädhä and Kåñëa. Then my spiritual life will be successful.]
[spells out] Habe means "will be." Äkuti, "eagerness." "When I shall be very much eager to understand what is spoken by the Gosvämés?'' These are the processes. We have to derive the pleasure of Nityänanda. We have to understand the six Gosvämés, what they are speaking. We have to cleanse our mind from material desires. These are the qualifications to understand what is Rädhä and Kåñëa. Otherwise, we shall be misled; we shall think Rädhä-Kåñëa ordinary boy and girl. No. 
The activities are just like that, but it is all spiritual. There is no material contamination at all. There is no material inebrieties. Therefore, in such loving affairs, in such embracing, such kissing in Rädhä and Kåñëa, that is all spiritual, eternal, blissful, full of knowledge, full of pleasure.
So at the present moment, in material condition, it is not possible to understand, but this is the purificatory process. We have to chant, 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu-nityänanda 
çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda
[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare
Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. 
[O Çrémäti Rädhäräëé (the divine energy of the Lord Kåñëa), O all-attractive reservoir of pleasure, Lord Çré Kåñëa, please engage me in Your loving devotional service.]
This chanting process has got the spiritual value to lead us to the highest stage of understanding Rädhä and Kåñëa. And as soon as we are capable of understanding what is Rädhä and Kåñëa, then it is possible for getting admission in the spiritual world. 
So all people interested in Kåñëa consciousness should follow the regulative principles, gradually reach the highest successful transcendental platform of understanding Rädhä and Kåñëa. [end]

This mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa Kåñëa Kåñëa Hare Hare, is being chanted by Brahmä with his four mouths. Brahmä-jape catur-mukhe. Brahmä means Lord Brahmä, and jape means he is chanting, catur-mukhe, with his four heads. Within this universe, only Brahmä has got four heads. And Lord Çiva sometimes exhibits five heads. 
So it is explained here that Lord Brahmä is also chanting this Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa Kåñëa Kåñëa Hare Hare, Hare Räma Hare Räma Räma Räma Hare Hare, with his four mouths, still he is chanting. He does not think that he is satiated. This transcendental name is so sweet that either you chant with your one mouth and one tongue or with one thousand mouth or one thousand tongue, still, you will never feel tired. That is the purport of this song. 
Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, he lamented that “This Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa Kåñëa Kåñëa Hare Hare, Hare Räma Hare Räma Räma Räma Hare Hare, these names are so sweet that how I can relish the transcendental sweetness with one tongue and one mouth? If God would have given me millions of tongues and millions of mouths, then I would have relished little of it.” So he lamented. 
Here also it is said that Närada Muni, he has got always with him a tambura, and he is traveling all over the universe constantly. He cannot stay in any place more than a few seconds, and he has no companion. But his only companion is that tambura and chanting Hare Kåñëa. Therefore it is said here, närada-yabe, véëä-yantre, kåñëa kåñëa hare hare. So all the devotees of the Lord, they are chanting in their own way, still they never feel tired or satiated. That is the significance of transcendental chanting... [end]

This transcendental vibration—by chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—is the sublime method for reviving our Kåñëa consciousness. As living spiritual souls we are all originally Kåñëa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter since time immemorial, our consciousness is now polluted by material atmosphere. In this polluted concept of live, we are all trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in our complexities. This illusion is called mäyä, or hard struggle for existence for winning over the stringent laws of material nature. This illusory struggle against the material nature can at once be stopped by revival of our Kåñëa consciousness.
Kåñëa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original energy of the living entity. When we hear the transcendental vibration, this consciousness is revived. And the process is recommended by authorities for this age. By practical experience also, we can perceive that by chanting this mahä-mantra, or the Great Chanting for Deliverance, one can at once feel transcendental ecstasy from the spiritual stratum. When one is factually on the plane of spiritual understanding, surpassing the stages of sense, mind and intelligence, one is situated on the transcendental plane. 
This chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare is directly enacted from the spiritual platform, surpassing all lower states of consciousness—namely sensual, mental and intellectual. There is no need of understanding the language of the mantra, nor is there any need of mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this mahä-mantra. It springs automatically from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in this transcendental sound vibration, without any previous qualification, and dance in ecstasy.
We have seen it practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting, or even a dog can take part in it. The chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate effect can be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips of nondevotee should be avoided, as much as milk touched by the lips of a serpent causes poisonous effect.
The word Harä is a form of addressing the energy of the Lord. Both Kåñëa and Räma are forms of addressing directly the Lord, and they mean "the highest pleasure, eternal." Harä is the supreme pleasure potency of the Lord. This potency, when addressed as Hare, helps us in reaching the Supreme Lord.
The material energy, called as mayä, is also one of the multipotencies of the Lord, as much as we are also marginal potency of the Lord. The living entities are described as superior energy than matter. When the superior energy is in contact with inferior energy, it becomes an incompatible situation. But when the supreme marginal potency is in contact with the spiritual potency, Harä, it becomes the happy, normal condition of living entity.
The three words, namely Harä, Kåñëa and Räma, are transcendental seeds of the mahä-mantra, and the chanting is spiritual call for the Lord and His internal energy, Harä, for giving protection to the conditioned soul. The chanting is exactly like genuine cry by the child for mother. Mother Harä helps in achieving the grace of the supreme father, Hari or Kåñëa, and the Lord reveals Himself to such sincere devotee.
No other means, therefore, of spiritual realization is as effective in this age, as chanting the mahä-mantra, 
Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa, 
Kåñëa Kåñëa Hare Hare,
Hare Räma Hare Räma,

[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, His incarnation Çré Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Çré Gadädhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Çréväsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu are complete when we say, 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda 
çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
As preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by chanting this Païca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Païca-tattva mantra, namely, 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda 
çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is known as mahä-vadänyävatära, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahä-mantra (Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare), we must first take shelter of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, learn the Païca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. That will be very effective.

Prayer to One's Beloved Lord

Prabhupäda: [sings Hari hari biphale, accompanied by harmonium] 
hari hari! bifale janama goìäinu
manuñya-janama päiyä, rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä,
jäniyä çuniyä biña khäinu
[O Lord Hari, I have wasted my life. Although I have taken this rare human birth, I have not served Rädhä and Kåñëa, and thus I have knowingly drunk poison.]

saàsära-biñänale, dibä-niçi hiyä jwale,
juräite nä koinu upäy
[The treasure of divine love in Goloka Våndävana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari’s holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns in the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not accepted the means for relieving it.]
brajendra-nandana jei, çacé-suta hoilo sei,
balaräma hoilo nitäi
déna-héna jata chilo, hari-näme uddhärilo,
tära çäkñé jagäi mädhäi
[Lord Kåñëa, the son of the King of Vraja, became the son of Çacé, and Balaräma became Nitäi. The holy name delivered all those souls who were lowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagäi and Mädhäi are evidence of this.]
hä hä prabhu nanda-suta, våñabhänu-sutä-juta,
koruëä karoho ei-bäro
narottama-däsa koy, nä öheliho räìgä päy,
tomä bine ke äche ämära
[O Lord Kåñëa, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Våñabhänu, please be merciful to me now. Narottama Däsa says, “O Lord, please do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?]

Pradyumna: Goìäinu. Goìäinu?
Prabhupäda: Yes. So shall I give the meaning also?
Pradyumna: Afterwards, I guess. Oh, this is the first verse? Hari hari biphale, janama goìäinu.
Prabhupäda: Janama goìäinu. This is first line. Hari hari biphale, janama goìäinu. The next line: manuñya-janama päiyä. M-a-n-u-s-y-a.

hari hari biphale janama goìäinu
manuñya-janama päiyä, rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä,
jäniyä çuniyä biña khäinu
The meaning is, Hari Hari, "My Lord,'' biphale, "uselessly,'' janama, "life,'' goìäinu, "spent up. I have uselessly spent up my life.'' Why? Because manuñya-janama päiyä, "I got this human form of life,'' manuñya-janama päiyä, rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä, "but I did not engage myself in the loving transcendental service of Rädhä and Kåñëa.'' 
Rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä, jäniyä çuniyä biña khäinu: "Willingly, purposefully, I have drunk poison.'' Hari hari biphale, janama goìäinu.
Pradyumna: Tell it for each word. Jäniyä means?
Prabhupäda: Jäniyä means knowingly, and çuniyä means hearing.
Pradyumna: Hearing?
Prabhupäda: Yes. Two kinds of knowledge are there. You can practically understand by experiment—this is called jäniyä. And another knowledge is by hearing from authoritative source. That is also knowledge. 
Jäniyä çuniyä "By hearing process and by experimental knowledge, in both ways, I know that this human form of life is meant for engaging in the loving service of Rädhä and Kåñëa, but I did not do that. That means purposefully I have drunk poison. I have committed suicide.'' 
Then golokera prema-dhana, g-o-l-e... No. G-o-l-o-k-e-r-a, golokera. Prema, p-r-e-m-a, prema. Dhana, d-h-a-n-a. Golokera prema-dhana. That means: "This chanting, Hare Kåñëa, is imported from the transcendental abode of Goloka." Hari-näma-saìkértana. "This chanting, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñë, Hare Hare, this is not material vibration. 
This sound is..." What is called? Captured? Just like we capture sound. The sound is in the air. So this sound... There are different layers of air, but this sound is in the highest layer, in the transcendental, spiritual layer, beyond this material world. From that sound it is captured. It requires strong machine to capture that sound. Golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana.
Pradyumna: Hari-näma-saì...
Prabhupäda: H-a-r-i-n-a-m-a, hari-näma, saìkértana, s-a-n-k-i-r-t-a-n-a. Hari-näma saìkértana. Rati nä janmila. R-a-t-i, n-a, nä, janmila, j-a-n-m-i-l-a. Rati nä janmila kena, k-e-n-a, täi, t-a-i. 
"It is so sublime, transcendental, and it is imported from the transcendental world, Goloka Våndävana. Unfortunately, I do not know why I did not get any attachment for such nice thing." Rati nä janmila kene täi. Täi means "in that." Biñaya biñänale. B-i-s-a-y-a, biñaya. Biña, b-i-s-a, biña, nale, n-a-l-e.

Prabhupäda: Biña, b-i-s-a, nale, n-a-l-e. Biñänale. The blazing fire of poison. The material enjoyment is blazing fire of poison. "Just like a person, if he is put into the blazing fire, he is burned into ashes, similarly, simply by thinking, 'How I shall enjoy this? How I shall enjoy this materially?' this is just like blazing fire of poison. So I am suffering always." 
Biñaya biñänale dibä-niçi hiyä jvale. Dibä-niçi, d-i-b-a, dibä-niçi. Dibä means day, and niçi, niçi means night. So "Day and night I am in this blazing fire."
Pradyumna: Neçi? How do you spell that?
Prabhupäda: Niçi, n-i-s-i.
Pradyumna: Dibä n-i-s-i, dibä-niçi.
Prabhupäda: Hiyä, h-i-a, hiyä, jvale, j-a..., j-v-a-l-e.
Pradyumna: J-v-e-l-e.
Prabhupäda: J-v-a-l-e. Dibä-niçi hiyä jvale: "The heart is burning always, day and night." Tarivare. T-a-r-i v-a-r-e, tarivare. Tarivare means "to get out of it."
Pradyumna: Can you spell that again?
Prabhupäda: Tarivare? T-a-r-i v-a-r-e.
Pradyumna: Vire?
Prabhupäda: R-e, tarivare.
Pradyumna: Tarivare.
Prabhupäda: Nä kainu. N-a, nä, kainu, k-a-i-n-u, nä kainu, upäya, u-p-a-y-a, upäya. Tarivare means "to get out of it,'' nä kainu, "did not do.'' Nä means "not,'' kainu, "did not do.'' Nä kainu upäya. Upäya means "means.'' That means "If anyone wants to get out of this blazing fire of poison of material enjoyment, then he has to take to this hari-näma-saìkértana, this chanting. 
That is the only method. So I did not do that. I engaged myself in this viñaya viñänale, this material enjoyment. Therefore my life has been uselessly spoiled. Tarivare nä kainu upäya. The next line, vrajendra-nandana yei. V-r-a-j-e-n-d-r-a, vrajendra, nandana, n-a-n-d-a-n-a, yei, y-a-i.
Pradyumna: Jia.
Prabhupäda: Jai. Vrajendranandana yei, çacé-suta, s-a-c-h-i-s-u-t-a, çacé-suta, haila, h-a-i-l-a, haila, sei, s-a-i, sei. Vrajendra-nandana yei, çacé-suta haila sei, balaräma haila nitäi. B-a-l-a-r-a-m-a, balaräma, haila, h-i, h-a-i-l-a. Haila, h-a-i-l-a, nitäi, n-i-t-a-i, haila nitäi. Balaräma haila nitäi. And this means... 
Vrajendra-nandana yei: "The Supreme Personality who appeared as the son of King Nanda, the same Supreme Personality Kåñëa has now appeared as the son of Mother Çacé." And Balaräma, b-a-l-a-r-a-m-a; haila, haila means "has become"; Nitäi, "Lord Nityänanda." "Formerly the Personality of Godhead who was... 
[Audio resumes]
...known as Balaräma has now become Lord Nityänanda." So what is their business? Päpé täpé yata chilo. P-a-p-i, t-a-p-i, päpé täpé, yata, y-a-t-a, yata chilo, c-h-h-i-l-a.
Pradyumna: C-h-h-i-l-a?
Prabhupäda: Yes. Päpé täpé yata chilo, hari-näme, uddhärilo. H-a-r-i, hari, näme, n-a-m-e, näme, uddhärilo, u-d-d-h-a-r-i-l-a. That means, "These two Personality of Godhead, They, simply by distributing the transcendental chanting, Hare Kåñëa, has reclaimed all conditioned and sinful souls." Päpé täpé yata chilo, hari-näme uddhärilo. 
"And the concrete example for this activity is Jagäi and Mädhäi, the two brothers known by Jagäi-Mädhäi.'' J-a-g-a-i, Jagäi, and Mädhäi, M-a-d-h-a-i. Päpé täpé yata chilo, hari näme uddharilo, tä'ra säkñé. Tä'ra säkñé, t-a-r, säkñé, s-a-k-s-h-i, säkñé, jagäi and mädhäi. 
And then last verse is hä hä prabhu nanda-suta. H-a-h-a, hä hä, prabhu, p-r-a-b-h-u, prabhu, nanda-suta, n-a-n-d-a-s-u-t-a. "My dear Lord Kåñëa, son of King Nanda..." Våñabhänu-sutä-yuta. V-r-i-s-a-b-h-a-n-u, våñabhänu, sutä, s-u-t...
Pradyumna: V-s... Våña?
Prabhupäda: Våñabhänu, b-h-a-n-u.
Pradyumna: B-h-a-n-u.
Prabhupäda: Våñabhänu-sutä, s-u-t-a. Sutä-yuta, y-u-t-a. That means, "My Lord Kåñëa, the son of King Nanda, You are now along with Rädhäräëé, the daughter of King Våñabhänu. So both of You are here. So I am Narottama däsa Öhäkura." Narottama, N-a-r-a-t-t-a-m-a, Narottama, däsa, d-a-s-a, däsa, kahe, k-a-h-e. "I am Narottama däsa. I am placing my appeal unto You." Narottama däsa ka..., nä theliho.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Hari hari! bifale janama goìäinu. This is a song sung by Narottama däsa Öhäkura, very stalwart äcärya in the line of Caitanya Mahäprabhu’s sampradäya, disciplic succession. He has sung many songs, important songs, and his songs are accepted as Vedic conclusion. Very authoritative songs. So he says, praying to Lord Kåñëa, “My dear Lord,” hari hari, “I have simply spoiled my life.” 
Hari hari bifale janama goìäinu. Why you have spoiled your life? He says, manuñya-janama päiyä, “I got this human form of life,” rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä, “but I did not care to worship Rädhä-Kåñëa. Therefore I have spoiled my life.” And how it is? It is exactly like one takes poison knowingly. If somebody takes poison unknowingly, there is excuse; but if somebody takes poison knowingly, it is suicidal. So he says, “I have committed suicide simply by not worshiping Rädhä and Kåñëa in this human form of life.”
Then he says, golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana. This Kåñëa consciousness movement, saìkértana movement, is nothing material. It is directly imported from the spiritual kingdom known as Goloka Våndävana. So golokera prema-dhana. And it is not ordinary song. It is just the treasure of love of Godhead. So... “But I have no attraction for this.” Rati nä janmilo täy. “I have no attraction for it. On the contrary,” viñaya-biñänale, dibä-niçi hiyä jwale, “and because I did not accept it, therefore the blazing fire of the poison of material existence is constantly burning me.” 
Dibä-niçi hiyä jwale. “Day and night, my heart is burning on account of this poisonous effect of material existence.” And taribare nä koinu upäy. “But I did not seek any remedy for this.” In other words, the remedy for this blazing fire of material existence is this saìkértana movement. It is imported from the spiritual kingdom. And who has imported it? Who has brought it?
Then he says, brajendra-nandana jei, çaci-suta hoilo sei. Brajendra-nandana, the son of King of Braja. That is Kåñëa. Kåñëa is known as son of Nanda Mahäräja. He was King of Brajabhümi. So brajendra-nandana jei, the same personality who was formerly the son of Nanda Mahäräja has now appeared as the son of Mother Çacé. Çacé-suta hoilo sei. 
And balaräma hoilo nitäi. And Lord Balaräma has become Nityänanda. So these two brothers adventing, They are delivering all kinds of fallen souls. Päpé-täpé jata chilo. As many fallen souls there were within this world, They’re delivering them simply by this chanting process. Hari-näme uddhärilo, simply by this chanting. How it is possible? Then he says, tära säkñé jagäi and mädhäi. The living example is the two brothers, Jagäi and Mädhäi. 
These Jagäi and Mädhäi, two brothers, they happened to be born in a brähmaëa family but they turned to be debauch number one. Of course, nowadays, in this age, their qualification is not considered debauch. Their debauchery was because they were drunkard and woman-hunter. Therefore they were called debauch. And meat-eater also. So... But they became later on, delivered by Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda, great devotees.
So Narottama däsa Öhäkura’s explanation says that in this age although people are drunkard, woman-hunter, meat-eater, and all..., gambler, all kinds of sinful actors, still, if they take to this Kåñëa consciousness movement and chant Hare Kåñëa, they’ll be delivered, undoubtedly. This is the blessings of Lord Caitanya. Then Narottama däsa Öhäkura prays, hä hä prabhu nanda-suta, våñabhänu-sutä-juta. “My dear Lord Kåñëa, You are son of King Nanda, and Your consort Rädhäräëé is the daughter King Våñabhänu. So You are together here standing.” 
Narottama däsa kahe, nä öheliho räìgä päy, “Now I am surrendering unto You, please do not kick me away or push me away with Your lotus feet because I have no other shelter. I am just taking shelter unto Your lotus feet without having any other means. So please accept me and deliver me.” This is the sum and substance of this song.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Hari hari biphale janama goìäinu. This is a prayer offered by Çré Narottama däsa Öhäkura. We have several times sung songs composed by Narottama däsa Öhäkura, and he is very much authorized. His songs are considered on the evidence of Vedas. In other words, he explains Vedic truth in very simple language. 
So he is lamenting, hari hari biphale janama goìäinu: “My Lord Hari.”Hari means “my Lord”; biphale, “uselessly”; janama, “birth”; goìäinu, “squandered.” “The valuable human form of life I have squandered uselessly.” Hari hari biphale janama goìäinu. 
Why? 
manuñya-janama päiyä
rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä
“This human form of life was granted to me to become Kåñëa conscious, to worship Rädhä and Kåñëa. But instead of becoming Kåñëa conscious I have simply squandered my life in useless material sense gratification. Therefore I have spoiled my life,” he is lamenting. 
hari hari biphale janama goìäinu 
manuñya-janama päiyärädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä
“This human form of life was especially meant for becoming Kåñëa conscious and worshiping Rädhä and Kåñëa, so,” jäniyäçuniyä biña khäinu, “I have taken poison knowingly.” Sometimes poison is administered unknowingly, but “I have knowingly taken the poison. I know that this life is meant for developing Kåñëa consciousness, but without doing this, I have simply squandered my life. Therefore purposely, with intension, I have taken poison.” Jäniyäçuniyä biña khäinu. Biña means “poison.”
Then he says, golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana: “This hari-saìkértana movement, Kåñëa conscious movement, is brought down directly from Goloka Våndävana.” There this chanting of Hare Kåñëa is going on amongst the devotees in love with Kåñëa. It is not a material thing; it is imported from there, from Goloka Våndävana, golokera prema-dhana. “And this chanting is based on affection and love with Kåñëa”; it is not official chanting. Prema-dhana. Prema-dhana means “an asset of love.” 
So, 
golokera prema-dhana
hari-näma-saìkértana
rati nä janmila kene täya
“I have no attraction for this transcendental chanting,” rati nä janmila. Rati means “attraction.” “I could not develop my attraction for this. I developed my attraction for material propensities, and what is the result of my material propensities?” Biñänale dibä-niçi hiyä jvale. Material propensities means eating, sleeping, mating and defending. These four principles are called material propensities. So they are considered as blazing fire. Biñänale dibä-niçi hiyä jvale: “The heart is always burning with this blazing fire.” Tarivare nä kainu upäya: “And I did not try to find out if there is any remedy for this blazing fire. Therefore I have wasted my time. Although the holy name, chanting of holy name, is there, I did not search out there.” So rati nä janmila kena täya.
Now, he says again, “Who has brought…, who has imported this nice transcendental chanting?” He says, brajendra-nandana jei çacé-suta haila sei: “Formerly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as the son of Mahäräja Nanda, Brajendra, the king of Vraja, that the same Supreme Personality has now appeared as çacé-suta, as the son of Çacé devé.” Lord Caitanya's name was Çacé-suta because His mother's name was Çacé devé. “The same personality, or that means Kåñëa Himself, has appeared as Çré Caitanya, Nimai, the son of Çacé devé,” and balaräma haila nitäi, “and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Balaräma, who was considered elder brother of Kåñëa, He has appeared as Nitäi.” What is Their business? In this age, what is Their business? Papé-täpé jata chilo hari-näme uddhärila: “Their business is to deliver all kinds of fallen and sinful conditioned souls.” How is that? Tära säkñi jagäi and mädhäi: “The exact evidence is Jagäi and Mädhäi, the typical examples of papéand täpé.” Jagäi and Mädhäi, two brothers, they were debauched number one. All kinds of sinful activities they were doing. But Nitai, Lord Nétyänanda, delivered them, simply requesting them to chant Hare Kåñëa. 
So Lord Caitanya and Nétyänanda set one or two examples—not too many—but they were very prominent examples: Jagäi and Mädhäi. So the purpose was that in this age you cannot find any well-equipped Vedäntist or very learned scholar in self-realization. You will simply find examples like Jagäi and Mädhäi—all debauched number one, addicted to intoxication, sex and meat-eating and all. You will meet only this. The world is full of these persons, Jagäi and Mädhäi. So if they are to be delivered, then no system of self-realization will prove effective—only this system introduced by Lord Caitanya, Nétyänanda, Hare Kåñëa, they will be delivered now. This is a fact. 
papé täpé jata chila 
hari-näme uddhärila
tära säkñi jagäi and mädhäi
So the evidence is there. When one Jagäi, Mädhäi…, one pair of Jagäi and Mädhäi was delivered, why not many pairs of Jagäi andMädhäi? So they can be delivered simply by chanting this Hare Kåñëa. 
So Narottama däsa Öhäkura is praying to Rädhä-Kåñëa, hä hä prabhu nanda-suta båñabhanü-sutä-juta: “My dear Kåñëa, son of Mahäräja Nanda, You are along with Rädhäräëé,” båñabhanü-sutä. Rädhäräëés father's name was Båñabhanü, so She is known as also the daughter of Båñabhanü. So Kåñëa and Rädhäräëé, They were very young, so They are addressed as the son and daughter of such-and-such persons. So They become very glad when Their parental names are taken or Their devotees’ name are taken. Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura is addressing not as Kåñëa—as the son of King Nanda, and Rädhäräëé as the daughter of King Båñabhanü. So “You are together here, and I am Narottama däsa Öhäkura; I am praying to You that ’Don’t kick me away.’ ”  
hä hä prabhu nanda-suta båñabhanü-sutä-juta
karunä karaha ei-bära
“Now I have come to my consciousness that You are the only deliverer, so I have come to You, so please do not kick me away. Please accept me, because I have no other shelter. I fully surrender unto You.” [end]

[Lord Kåñëa, who is the son of the King of Vraja, became the son of Çacé (Lord Caitanya), and Balaräma became Nitäi. The holy name delivered all those souls who were lowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagäi and Mädhäi are evidence of this.]

[O Lord Kåñëa, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Våñabhänu, please be merciful to me now. Narottama däsa says, "O Lord, please do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?"]

Prayer to One's Beloved Lord

Prabhupäda: ...especially introduced by the disciplic succession of Lord Caitanya, and this Narottama däsa Öhäkura, who has sung this hari hari biphale janama goìäinu, he's a famous äcärya. His compositions are accepted as Vedic truth. So this purport of this song is very nice. He's lamenting, appealing to Hari, the Lord. 
Hari hari biphale janama goìäinu: "My dear Lord, I have uselessly spoiled my life." Biphale means uselessly, and janama means birth, and goìäinu means "I have passed." He's representating a common man, as every one of us is simply spoiling our life. They do not know that they are spoiling their life. 
They are thinking that "I've got very nice apartment, very nice car, very nice wife, very nice income, very nice social position." So many things. These are the material attraction. Gåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittair. 
[child crying] [aside:] Stop it. Oh, that's all... 
The attraction, material attraction, is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam in many ways. In one place it is very nicely summarized what is this material attraction. The basic principle of material attraction is sex. [child crying] Pumsaù striya mithuni-bhavam etam [SB 5.5.8]. 
[The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of "I and mine.]
A man is hankering after another woman, and the woman is hankering after another man. This is the basic principle of material life. Puàsaù striyä mithuné-bhävam etam [SB 5.5.8]. 
Mithuné-bhävam means sex. Tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim. And when they actually come into sexual life, each one of them become too much attracted. 
Hådaya-granthim. Granthi means very hard knot: "I cannot leave you." He says, "I cannot leave you. You are my life and soul," and she says, "You are my life and soul." For a few days. [laughs] And then again divorce. You see? 
But the beginning is there. Basic principle of material attraction is this sex life. This is general. Those who have organized the sex life in social convention in so many ways... The marriage is also another convention to give a very finishing nice touch than the animal. That's all. 
Just like sometimes it is said marriage is legalized prostitution. So for social convention the marriage is a license, but it is also based on the sex life. But for keep up social life, one has to accept some regulative principle. Therefore sex life like animals and sex life in marriage, there is difference; it is better. That is accepted in civilized world.
So when they're united some way or other, then next demand is nice apartment, gåha. The next demand, gåha-kñetra, land. Because human civilization is based on land and cow, gavayä dhanavän. Formerly, a person was considered to be rich man by possession of the number of cows, by possession of land, not these papers, this false money. At the present moment, if you have got some printed paper, thousand dollars... They are papers actually. 
When the government is a failure, it has no value. But actually if you possess some land and cows, the government may fail or not fail, your value is there. So that is actual property. Therefore in Sanskrit language it is said gavayä dhanavän. A man is known as rich man by the number of..., by possession of the number of cows. That was the mode of civilization in the Vedic age. 
Gåha-kñetra-suta. Suta means children. When you have got apartment, when you have got wife, when you have got..., then next demand is children, suta. Because without children no home life is pleasant. Putra-hénaà gåhaà çünyam [Cäëakya Paëòita]. 
[Life without knowledge is empty, and all directions are void for those without friends. Household life without a son is void, and for the poor the whole world is void.]
A home life is just like desert without children. Children is the attraction of home life. So grha-kñetra-suta äpta. Äpta means relatives or society. Sutäpta-vittaiù: and all these paraphernalia are to be maintained on money. Therefore money is required, vittaiù. In this way, one becomes entangled in this material world. Janasya moho 'yam. This is called illusion. Illusion. 
Why illusion? So important things, why illusion? Illusion means that this nice paraphernalia arrangement—home, life, apartment, wife, children, society, position—everything is all right, but as soon as this body is finished, everything is finished; you're in a next platform. You do not know what is next platform. The next platform may be a human being or a cat or a dog or a demigod or anything. You do not know. 
And as soon as you have got a next life, you forget all these things. There is no remembrance what I was, what was my home. Everything is finished. Everything is finished—flash, just like a bubble. By the thrashing of different waves in the ocean, there are so many bubbles immediately generated, and the next moment, oh, they are all finished. Finished. Toye janame punaù toye samat[?]. 
In this way the life is going on. The living entity is traveling in many species of life, in many planets. But this human form of life is an opportunity to understand how I am transmigrating from one place to another, one life to another, and simply wasting my time without understanding what is my constitutional position, why I am so much in distress, miseries. 
These things are to be understood in this human form of life. But instead of understanding my real position, the process of life, we reject everything. Simply I am engaged with the gåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittaiù [SB 5.5.8]. 
[The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of "I and mine.]
Gåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittaiù—home, society, money, position—everything is all right provided you can utilize it for elevating yourself from these material clutches. Otherwise, if you are simply engaged and captivated by these things, then I am spoiling my life.
So Narottama däsa Öhäkura, representing ourself, he is lamenting, "My dear Lord, I have spoiled my life. I have simply spoiled my life." Why? This life, this human form of life, manuñya-janama päiyä, rädhä-kåñëa nä bhajiyä. This human form of life was meant for understanding what is Rädhä-Kåñëa and worship Rädhä-Kåñëa or Lord, His energy, whatever you call—Hare Kåñëa or Rädhä-Kåñëa, Hare Räma, the same thing, the Lord and His energy. 
So, "Instead of making contact with Rädhä-Kåñëa, I am simply spoiling my life in sense gratification." So he's lamenting, hari hari biphale janama goìäinu: "Uselessly I have spoiled my life." 
[O Lord Hari, I have spent my life uselessly. Having obtained a human birth and having not worshiped Rädhä and Kåñëa, I have knowingly drunk poison.]
Why? What is your lamentation? He says, golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana. 
[The treasure of divine love in Goloka Våndävana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari's holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns in the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not accepted the means for relieving it.]
This chanting of Hare Kåñëa, this transcendental vibration, is not any material thing. It is imported from the transcendental abode, golokera. Goloka means the transcendental abode of Kåñëa. 
Golokera prema-dhana. From there, the transcendental abode of Kåñëa... Just like the sunshine, wherefrom it has come? From the sun planet. Everyone knows it. Although you cannot go there, it is far, far beyond your reach, but you can understand that the sunshine is coming from the sun globe. There is no doubt about it. 
Similarly this vibration, this shining, is coming from Kåñëa, Goloka. Golokera prema-dhana. And prema-dhana means this chanting is in love with Kåñëa. So golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana, rati nä janmilo kene täy. "I've no attachment for this." 
[The treasure of divine love in Goloka Våndävana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari’s holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns in the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not accepted the means for relieving it.]
Why should one be attached to this? That is explained in the next line: viñaya-viñänale, dibä-niçi hiyä jvale. Hiyä. Hiyä means heart. Our heart is always burning. Why? In touch with this material sense gratificatory process. No sense gratificatory process is giving me satisfaction. 
I'm trying this way, that way, this way, that way, that way. You see? Just like people are trying sense gratification in so many ways, they have come to the last point, naked picture, naked dance. What is called? That short, what is called?
Devotee: Miniskirt.
Prabhupäda: Miniskirt, yes. [laughs] So because here the basic principle only sex, everyone is inviting, "Yes, come on, sex. Come on, sex." But this way, that way, sex, anyway you enjoy, you cannot be satisfied. That is certain. Because that is not your platform of enjoyment. 
You are spirit soul. Unless you come to the spiritual platform, these material, any kind of sense enjoyment... Therefore you will never be satisfied. You'll simply hankering after, but there will be no satisfaction. 
Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, viñaya-viñänale. Viñaya means these material demands, eating, sleeping, mating, these are called viñaya. They are just like poison, fire. So everyone is burning. Viñaya-viñänale, dibä-niçi hiyä jvale. Jvale means it is burning, my heart is burning. Tari bare nä koinu upäy. "But I did not search out the relief, the immediate relief, hari-saìkértana, this chanting. I have no attachment for this. Therefore I have spoiled my life."
Then he says, brajendra-nandana yei, çacé-suta hoilo sei. Now, this chanting of Hare Kåñëa is introduced by Kåñëa Himself, Vrajendra-nandana. Kåñëa appeared as the son of Mahäräja Nanda in Våndävana; therefore He is called Vrajendra-nandana, Vrajeça-tanaya. These are names. So this same Vrajendra-nandana, Kåñëa, has appeared as Çacénandana. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead takes pleasure when He's addressed with His devotee's name, with His energy's name. Devotee's also His energy. So He has no father. He is father of everyone. But He accepts some devotee. A devotee wants Kåñëa as his son; therefore Kåñëa accepts a devotee as His father. 
So nobody can become His father, but a devotee... Just like this girl, Nandaräëé, is raising her daughter, always giving service. The child is accepting service from the parents. Her business is only to accept. Torture and accept service. So devotees accept Kåñëa as son so that Kåñëa may simply torture them and accept service. That is the policy. Because the devotee want to render service, so this is the best way of service rendering. The child will draw always service. 
So this conception, fatherhood of the Absolute Truth, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is undoubtedly very good, but there is no service. Father is meant for exacting: "Father, give me this. Father, give me this." And here, the Vaiñëava conception, to accept the Supreme as child to render service. Not to accept. No parents accept any service from the child, but he simply gives service.
So anyway, Vrajendra-nandana, the idea of accepting the Lord as son... Mahäräja Nanda accepted Kåñëa as his son, similarly Çacédevé accepted Lord Caitanya as his [her] son. So both of Them are the one. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, "The same Vrajendra-nandana, Kåñëa, has now appeared as Lord Caitanya, as the son of Çacé. And the same Balaräma has become Nitäi." 
And what is Their business? The business is päpé-täpé jata chilo: "They are claiming all kinds of sinful conditioned souls." Their only business is. Because in this age, Kali-yuga, you cannot find any perfectly pious man or saintly person. Everyone is addicted to so many sinful activities. 
So päpé-täpé yata chilo, hari-näme uddhärilo. Simply by distributing this chanting, He claimed everyone, however fallen he may be. "Come on, chant Hare Kåñëa and become delivered." You see? So nice thing. Päpé-täpé yata chilo, hari-näme uddhärila. What is the evidence that He has? Ta 'ra säkñé jagäi and mädhäi. Jagäi-Mädhäi, they were two brothers, debauch number one. You see? 
They were all kinds of sinful affairs. They were drunkard, they were woman hunter, meat-eater, so many things. And, of course, they were born in a very high brähmaëa family, but bad association, they became like that. Similarly, at the present age, this human society, although they are coming from the Äryan family, very nice family, but due to association the only environment is there's woman and intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. That's all. So Jagäi-Mädhäi is the specimen, sample of this population, and Lord Caitanya delivered them simply by this Hare Kåñëa. 
So this chanting process, Hare Kåñëa, will actually deliver all these fallen souls without any failure. It is not bogus propaganda. Anyone who will take to this chanting process, whatever, you don't consider about his past life. He will become saintly. He will become a pure Kåñëa conscious person. So päpé-täpé yata chilo, hari-näme uddhärilo, ta 'ra säkñé jagäi-mädhäi. The evidence is Jagäi-Mädhäi.
Then he says, hä hä... When he has come to the senses that "I am eternal servant of Kåñëa," then he surrenders. This process, the chanting process, will purify our heart, our burning heart, and one will come to the understanding that "I am eternal servitor of the Supreme, Kåñëa." Then, as soon as he comes to this understanding, as it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä, bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate [Bg 7.19], 
[After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.]
"After many, many births, when one person becomes actually wise, a man of wisdom, jïänavän"—jïänavän means wise man—then what does he do? "He surrenders unto Me," Kåñëa says. Why? Väsudevaù sarvam iti [Bg 7.19]: "Because Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is everything." Sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù: "That kind of great soul is very rare." That is stated in...
But Caitanya Mahäprabhu has made easy to become such kind of great soul simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa. Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura, at the end he says, hä hä prabhu nanda-suta, våñabhänu-sutä-juta. Again the sutä, the son, son of Nanda, and Rädhäräëé, the daughter of Våñabhänu, They are standing. Kåñëa... Vaiñëava, they do not worship Kåñëa alone without Rädhäräëé. 
They do not worship Räma without Sétä. They do not worship Näräyaëa without Lakñmé. Because the Lord and the energy must be there. We don't say..., we don't believe that God is without any energy. No. "Hare Kåñëa." First the energy is addressed, Harä, Hare, then Kåñëa. 
So here also, Narottama däsa Öhäkura prays, "My dear Lord Kåñëa, You are now present before me with Your internal potency, Your pleasure potency, Rädhäräëé. So I am surrendering unto You." Hä hä prabhu nanda-sutä. And "Don't neglect me because I am so sinful, my past life is so black. Don't neglect me. Please accept me. Don't kick me away. I surrender unto You." This is the purport of this song.
So this instruction should be taken by all of us. The purificatory process is chanting Hare Kåñëa. And as soon as our heart is purified, we completely become convinced that "The Lord is Supreme. I am His eternal servant. I have forgotten this. Servant..., my servitorship is there, but instead of serving the Lord, I am serving my senses. That's all. 
I have never become the master. I am not master of my senses; I am the servant of my senses. That is my position." So why not becoming the servant of the Supreme instead of serving on the servant of the senses? 
You cannot become master. Actually, you become master of the senses when you are actually servant of Kåñëa; otherwise it is not possible. There are two words, gosvämé and go-däsa. Persons who are servant of their senses, they are called materialistic go-däsa, and persons who are master of the senses, they are called gosvämé. Gosvämé. 
They control the senses. The tongue wants to eat something which is not... "Oh," he controls. "Oh, tongue, you cannot taste these things. It is not kåñëa-prasäda." Therefore he becomes gosvämé, master. He does not allow the tongue to eat any nonsense thing except kåñëa-prasäda. He cannot allow his senses, his anything, for sense gratification. Only for the service. That is called devotional service.
Håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc Madhya 19.170]. 
[Bhakti, or devotional service, means engaging all our senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all the senses. When the spirit soul renders service unto the Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and one’s senses are purified simply by being employed in the service of the Lord.]
Bhakti, this devotional service, means when you engage your senses for the satisfaction of the master of the senses. The supreme master of the senses is Kåñëa. So we are trying to apply the senses for our personal service. This is called mäyä; this is called illusion. The same senses purified, when they'll be engaged in the service of Kåñëa, that is perfection. So we are not going to stop the activities of the senses, but senses are being purified for being engaged in the service of the Lord. This is Kåñëa consciousness.
Thank you very much. [devotees offer obeisances] 
So, any question? Yes.
Tamäla Kåñëa: Prabhupäda, how was it that Lord Jesus was called a son of God? If Kåñëa is usually the son, how come Jesus was the son?
Prabhupäda: Not usually. Kåñëa is father, that I told you. But He becomes son out of His love. Kåñëa is father. Kåñëa's position is father, but He... He's simply father, so He voluntarily becomes a son also sometimes, to taste how to become a son. Son is not His constitutional position. 
Father is His constitutional position. But He voluntarily accepts to become a son. But who is going to be His father? He is the original father. He is a father of everyone. Ahaà béja-pradaù pitä. In the Bhagavad-gétä says there, sarva-yoniñu kaunteya [Bg 14.4]: 
[It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunté, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.]
"There are millions, 8,400,000 species of life, and I am the father of all these living entities." So who is going to be His father? Nobody is father, but a devotee, when likes, "My dear Lord, I want a son like You," so Kåñëa accepts: "Oh, where is another son like Me? I'll become your son." That's all. 
Just like Vasudeva and Devaké. In their previous life they underwent severe austerities. They were married couples, but they had no sex. They were determined that "Unless we get the Lord as our son, we are not having any son." So they went on for many years, many thousands years' austerity. 
Then the Lord appeared: "What do you want?" "Sir, I want a son like You." "Where can I get another son like Me? I'll become your son." So Kåñëa, or the Lord, is father of everyone, but He voluntarily accepts to become a son to His devotee. Otherwise His position is always father. 
Yes.
Madhudviña: Prabhupäda, I read in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Volume Three, that when one becomes a liberated soul, he attains perfect freedom, and even sometimes that freedom is on the same level as Kåñëa or even more than Kåñëa.
Prabhupäda: Yes.
Madhudviña: Can you explain that?
Prabhupäda: Yes. Just like this Vasudeva, he's more than Kåñëa. Yaçodä... You have seen the picture, Yaçodä is binding Kåñëa?
Madhudviña: Oh, the little baby. Yes.
Prabhupäda: Yes, He has become... The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is, I mean to say, afraid, who is fearful by everyone, Yaçodä..., and Kåñëa has become fearful to Yaçodä: "My dear mother, kindly do not bind Me. I shall obey your orders." So Yaçodä has become more than God, more than Kåñëa. 
The Mäyävädé philosophers, they want to be one with Kåñëa or one with Lord, but our philosophy is to become more than Kåñëa. [laughter] Why one with Kåñëa? More than Kåñëa. And actually He accepts. He makes His devotee more than Kåñëa. Just like Arjuna and Kåñëa. Kåñëa took the part of a driver, and he was the hero of the fight. 
Actually, Kåñëa was the hero, but He gave position to His devotee: "You become the hero. I shall become your charioteer." That's all. Don't you see how Arjuna has become more than Kåñëa? Kåñëa says, "Arjuna, you are hesitating to fight, but you know that all these person who have assembled in this battlefield, they are not going back. They are already killed. That is My plan. You simply take the credit that you have killed them. That's all." [laughter] That He wants. 
Just like a father wants a son to see him more than himself. If a father is an M.A., he wants to see his son M.A., Ph.D., or something more. He's satisfied. He'll not tolerate anybody to become more than him, but he'll tolerate if his son becomes more than him. I'm giving you a crude example. 
Similarly, Kåñëa, or the Lord, wants to see His devotee more than Himself. That is His pleasure. He takes pleasure in that. So to become a devotee is not ordinary thing. You see? He has got the chance to become more than God. Why equal with God, one with God? No. More than God. Yes. That is our philosophy.
Yes?
Jaya-gopäla: What is the relationship of the surabhé cow with Kåñëa?
Prabhupäda: Huh?
Jaya-gopäla: What is the relationship of the surabhé cow with Kåñëa?
Prabhupäda: They are also... These cows are also devotees, and Kåñëa is fond of keeping cows, taking care of them. The same love affairs, exchange of love. That's all.
Jaya-gopäla: Which...
Prabhupäda: Däsya-rasa. Däsya-rasa, servitude. There are different rasas, mellows of relationship with Kåñëa. Çänta, däsya... Just like Våndävana-bhümi or the trees, the plants, they are serving Kåñëa silently. And the cows and servants, they are offering superior service. The friends, they are offering service as friend. 
The gopés, they are... Gopés, or the motherly gopés, just like Yaçodä and ladies, offer their..., loving Kåñëa as son, and the younger girls, they're loving Kåñëa as husband, as lover. So in this way in Våndävana there are different transcendental mellows of loving affairs. 
So the cows are on the çänta..., däsya-rasa, giving service, just like master and servant. They are situated in this transcendental humor. But they're all one with Kåñëa. Nobody is inferior than Kåñëa, but the relationship is exchange of loving service. That's all.
Nandaräëé: Is our rasa with Kåñëa already established? I mean, is it eternal? Or do we..., can we attain...
Prabhupäda: No. It is already established. You have got eternal relationship. When you become liberated, you realize that your relationship is with Kåñëa like this. You'll develop that taste, whether in çänta-rasa or däsya-rasa or mädhurya-rasa or vätsalya-rasa. But that is not to be imitated at the present moment. When we are actually liberated. 
To come to that stage, the routine work, regulative work, should be followed: chanting, hearing, worshiping, following the regulative principles. In this way, gradually, as we are purified, we come to the pure consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness. Then at once we understand, "My relationship with Kåñëa is like this." And you are transferred to the Kåñëaloka in that humor.
Dayänanda: We could also have a passive relationship with Kåñëa, like a tree?
Prabhupäda: Yes. That will be revealed, how we are related with Kåñëa. Every relationship is as good as the other. Just like in this material world, everyone's position, he thinks it is very nice. Similarly, in the spiritual, what to speak, they are all equal, but still, one is apprec..., one's aptitude is that "I want to love Kåñëa in this way." Yes. 
So he's there in that way. There must be variety. If there is rasa-lélä, there must be nice trees, nice field, nice cows, nice Yamunä river. Otherwise how it is, simply if the gopés and Kåñëas are there, if the other things are not there? [chuckles] The background must be there. 
So everything is spiritual. Background is also spiritual. That is creation of Kåñëa. Eko bahu-çyäma. Just like a painter paints a picture, he makes a nice background. Similarly, Kåñëa wants to enjoy, so He has created us in different varieties to supply His pleasure potency. You see. Eko bahu-çyäma. This Vedic literature says that alone He has many. Why? Just to enjoy. Why? Änandamayo 'bhyäsät [Vedänta-sütra 1.1.12]. 
[By nature, the Supreme Lord is blissful.]
He's by nature joyful, sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù [Bs 5.1]. 
[Kåñëa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.]
So änanda does not mean that one. No. Variety. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. So that variety, they're all spiritual. Just like the same example: you paint a picture with the same brush and color, but as soon as you make it variety, variegated, it becomes very enjoyable. 
So we don't say that the varieties created by God is false. No. It is real. How can I say it is false? This flower, it is designed by God so nicely, it is colored so nicely. It has got its use. There is variety. Even there is greenness... There is so many things, varieties. There is color display, sometimes a dark red, sometimes it is light red. 
So nicely created by Kåñëa, and I shall say it is false? Why it is false? It is Kåñëa's creation. Let me take it and offer it to Kåñëa. This is called bhakti. This is called Kåñëa consciousness. I don't enjoy it. It is Kåñëa's creation; it must be offered to Kåñëa. 
And after offering to Kåñëa, you'll enjoy. After offering nice prasäda, Kåñëa is full, Kåñëa is not eating. You'll enjoy. That is Kåñëa consciousness. We don't reject anything. This tape recorder we don't reject. We don't say, "Oh, it is material. We shall not touch." Bring any scientific invention, we shall engage in the service of Kåñëa. That's all. [laughter] 
We don't say it is false. Why? You have applied your brain, you applied your energy to invent such nice machine. Let it be engaged in Kåñëa's service. Your life will be successful. That's all. The flower from... The tree from which this flower is grown, if this flower is offered to Kåñëa, his life is successful. 
So it is so nice program, Kåñëa consciousness. All-round successful. There is no comparison with this program, Kåñëa consciousness. There cannot be any comparison, neither any rivalry with this conception of philosophy, Kåñëa consciousness. So try to understand, preach it nicely, and be happy, and let them become happy. 
So you want to chant something or..., no?
Tamäla Kåñëa: Well, the neighbors, ah...
Prabhupäda: All right. That's all right. We have chanted. Now we can distribute prasädam. [devotees offer obeisances] 
[aside:] You distribute. I want to go to the bathroom. 
[break] "Oh, I don't like this. He may come back." He must be seen as beloved child. First of all he gave him work just like ordinary laborer. He became sick. He's also tasting. That is nice. [laughs] 
So tomorrow we must find out some store. 
[Prabhupäda eats]
Tamäla Kåñëa: Prabhupäda? I spoke to Puruñottama. He is coming here.
Prabhupäda: Coming?
Tamäla Kåñëa: Yes.
Prabhupäda: That's nice.
Tamäla Kåñëa: Brahmänanda said, "Do you know what you are doing to me, Tamäla? Now I have to do all the work here." So he said, "But it's all right." [Prabhupäda laughs] Number-one man.
Prabhupäda: So you may send somebody to help him.
Nandaräëé: Who is coming? [pause]
Tamäla Kåñëa: Puruñottama. He said it was all right, because Puruñottama can still get a lot of advertisements for Back to Godhead in Los Angeles area.
Prabhupäda: Oh, you can [indistinct].
Devotee: When's he coming? [end]

This is actual picture of Kåñëa, rädhä-mädhava giri-vara-dhäré. Original Kåñëa this is. Rädhä-mädhava giri-vara-dhäré. Vraja-jana-vallabha. His business is to please the inhabitants of Våndävana. That's all. He has no other business. And the vraja-jana also, they have no other business than to please Kåñëa. 
That's all. This is original Kåñëa. Vraja-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhäré. And first business is Rädhä-Mädhava. Of course, Kåñëa is concerned with everyone, especially concerned with Rädhäräëé. Rädhä-mädhava kuïja-bihäré, and He enjoys with Rädhä in different kuïjas, bushes, of Våndävana. 
And then, yaçodä-nandana. Next He wants to please His mother, Yaçodä. Yaçodä-nandana vraja-jana-raïjana. And Kåñëa is very affectionate to all the inhabitants of Våndävana. The son of Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja. They love Kåñëa, all the elderly persons. They love. 
Elderly ladies and persons, they love Kåñëa. "Oh, here is the son of Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja.'' They're all tenants and subordinates to Nanda Mahäräja. Nanda Mahäräja is the chief man in Våndävana, and they are their subjects. So they are affectionate to Kåñëa because He happens to be son of Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja.
And Kåñëa's business is... [end]

[Kåñëa is the lover of Rädhä.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

So this is the original nature of Kåñëa, original nature of Kåñëa. He is Rädhä-Mädhava. He is the lover of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. And kuïja-vihäré, always enjoying the company of the gopés within the bushes of Våndävana forest. Rädhä-mädhava kuïja-vihäré. So He’s not only lover of Rädhäräëé, but braja-jana-vallabha. The whole residents of Våndävana, they love Kåñëa. They do not know anything else. 
They do not know whether Kåñëa is God or not, neither they are very much harassed that “I shall love Kåñëa if He is God.” “He may be God or He may be whatever He is. It doesn’t matter, but we love Kåñëa, that’s all.” That is called unnalloyed love. “If Kåñëa is God, then I shall love Him”—this is conditional love. This is not pure love. 
Kåñëa may be God or whatever He may be, but by His wonderful acts, the Vrajaväsés, they are thinking, “Oh Kåñëa, He is very wonderful child, maybe some demigod. Maybe some demigod.” Because people are generally under impression that the demigods are all-powerful. They’re powerful within this material world. But they do not know that Kåñëa is above all of them. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù [Bs 5.1]. 
[Kåñëa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.]
The highest demigod, Brahmä, is giving his opinion, “The supreme controller is Kåñëa.” So as the residents of Våndävana, they love Kåñëa without any condition, similarly, Kåñëa also loves them. 
Vraja-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhäré. When the inhabitants of Våndävana were in danger because they stopped Indra-yajïa and Indra became very angry, and he sent very great, powerful cloud and rained over Våndävana incessantly for seven days, so when the inhabitants became very much disturbed, Kåñëa, although He was only seven years old boy, He saved them by lifting the Govardhana Hill. So He taught Indradeva, demigod, that “To stop your disturbance is the business of My little finger, that’s all.” [laughter] So he came down to his knees. These things we’ll find in Kåñëa book. 
So as Gopé-jana-vallabha, His only business is how to protect gopé-jana. So our Kåñëa consciousness movement is how to become one of the gopé-jana. Then Kåñëa will save us from any danger, even by lifting a hill or mountain. Kåñëa is so kind and so powerful. When Kåñëa lifted the hill, He did not practice some yoga system. That is God. Although He was a child, He was playing like a child, He was dealing like a child, but when there was need, He was manifesting as God. That is Kåñëa. That is Kåñëa. Not that He has to go and practice some yoga system, then He becomes God. No. He’s not that type of God, not manufactured God. He’s God.
So gopé-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhäré. And as a child, as beloved child of Yaçodä, Yaçodä-nandana,... Kåñëa likes to be a child of a devotee. He wants to be chastised from His devotee father and mother. Because everyone worships Him, nobody goes to chastise Him, so He takes pleasure when a devotee chastises Him. That is Kåñëa’s service. If Kåñëa takes pleasure being chastised, so the responsibility is taken by a devotee: “All right, I shall become Your father and chastise You.” When Kåñëa wants to fight, one of His devotee becomes Hiraëyakaçipu and fights with Him. So all activities of Kåñëa is with His devotees. He is... Therefore, to become associate of Kåñëa, to develop Kåñëa consciousness... 
Yaçodä-nandana vraja-jana-raïjana. His only business is how to satisfy... As braja-jana’s business is how to satisfy Kåñëa, similarly, Kåñëa’s business is how to satisfy braja-jana. This is reciprocation of love. Yamunä-téra-vana-cäré. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is wandering on the banks of Yamunä to please the gopés, the cowherd boys, the birds, beasts, calves. They are not ordinary birds, beasts, calves or men. They are on the top of self-realization. Kåta-puëya-puïjäù. After many, many lives they got that position, to play with Kåñëa.
So our Kåñëa consciousness movement is so nice that anyone can go to Kåñëaloka and become His associate, as a friend or so many other things, as a servant, as father, as mother. And Kåñëa is agreeable to any one of these propositions. These things are described very nicely in our Teachings of Lord Caitanya. So Kåñëa does not go even a step from Våndävana. The original Kåñëa is Våndävana. That is described in the Brahma-saàhitä,
cintämaëi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-våkña-
lakñävåteñu surabhér abhipälayantam
lakñmé-sahasra-çata-sambrahma-sevyamänaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà
 [Bs 5.29]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakñmés or gopés.]
Brahmä is accepting the Supreme Personality of Govinda, Kåñëa in Våndävana. Veëuà kvaëantam: “He is engaged in playing flute.”
aravinda-daläyatäkñaà
barhävataàsam asitämbuda-sundaräìgam
kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya-viçeña-çobhaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
[Bs 5.30]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals with head decked with peacock's feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupids.]
So take advantage of these books, this knowledge, and this prasädam, this chanting, and be happy and go to Kåñëa. So nice thing. All right.

Narottama däsa Öhäkura directs us

Prabhupäda: ...left by the six Gosvämés?" Äkuti means "eagerness." Because Rüpa Gosvämé is the father of devotional service, he has written a book called Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, in which there are nice directions on devotional service. These topics are also dealt with in Caitanya-caritämåta and other books, and we have given the summary of those directions in our book Teachings of Lord Caitanya. One has to learn of the conjugal loving affairs of Rädhä-Kåñëa through the teachings of these six Gosvämés. Narottama däsa Öhäkura directs us not to try to understand the conjugal love of Rädhä-Kåñëa by our own endeavor. We should try to understand this yugala-périti, conjugal love, under the direction of the Gosvämés.
As long as the mind is too much absorbed in materialistic thought, one cannot enter into the kingdom of Våndävana. But Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, viñaya chäriyä kabe çuddha ha'be mana kabe häma herabo çré-båndäbana: "When the mind is completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then I shall be able to understand Våndävana and the conjugal love of Rädhä and Kåñëa, and then my spiritual life will be successful." [end]

The Vedic mantras were all through music

Prabhupäda: Music. Na vidyä sangéta uttamam. The Vedic mantras were all through music. Säma Veda. Säma Veda is full of music.
yaà brahmä-varuëendra-rudra-marutaù stunvanti divyaiù stavair
vedaiù säìgopada-kramopaniñadair gäyanti yaà säma-gäù
[SB 12.13.1]
[Süta Gosvämé said: Unto that personality whom Brahmä, Varuëa, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise by chanting transcendental hymns and reciting the Vedas with all their corollaries, pada-kramas and Upaniñads, to whom the chanters of the Säma Veda always sing, whom the perfected yogés see within their minds after fixing themselves in trance and becoming fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, and whose limit can never be found by any demigod or demon—unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead I offer my humble obeisances.]
Sämagäù. Sämagäù means the followers of Säma Veda. Gayänti. They are always in music. Through musical vibration they are approaching the Supreme. Sämagäù. Gäyanti. Gäyanti means singing. So Vedic mantras are sung. This whole Bhagavad-gétä, Çrémad-Bhägavatam, can be sung very nicely. And it is Vedic mantra, chanting. Simply by hearing the vibration, people will be benefited, even they do not understand. This mantra you chant?

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Mänasa, deho, geho, jo kichu mor. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. He's teaching the process of full surrender. Mänasa, deho, geho, jo kichu mor. First of all, he is surrendering the mind, because mind is the origin of all kinds of speculations; and surrendering, rendering devotional service means first controlling the mind. Therefore he says mänasa, means "mind," then deha: "senses." Çaréra. Deha means this body; body means senses. 
So, if we surrender the mind unto the lotus feet of Kåñëa, then automatically the senses also become surrendered. Then, "my home." Deha, geho. Geho means home. Jo kichu mor. Our all possessions are comprising these three things: mind, body and our home. So Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura proposes to surrender everything. Arpilü tuwä pade, nanda-kiçor. Nanda-kiçor is Kåñëa. So "I am surrendering my mind, my body and my home unto You." Now, sampade vipade, jévane-maraëe: "Either I am in happiness or I am in distress, either I am in living condition or I am dead." 
Däy mama gelä, tuwä o-pada baraëe: "Now I am relieved. I am feeling relief because I have surrendered unto You everything." Märobi räkhobi-jo icchä tohärä: "Now it is up to You whether You like to keep me or You want to kill me; that depends on You." Nitya-däsa prati tuwä adhikärä: "You have got every right to do whatever You think right in relation with Your servant. I am Your eternal servant."

The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the sublime method for reviving our transcendental consciousness. As living spiritual souls, we are all originally Kåñëa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter from time immemorial, our consciousness is now adulterated by the material atmosphere. The material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called mäyä, or illusion. Mäyä means that which is not. 
And what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of the material nature, while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the all-powerful master, it is called illusion. We are trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore, although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our eternal Kåñëa consciousness.
Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa Kåñëa Kåñëa Hare Hare, Hare Räma Hare Räma Räma Räma Hare Hare, is the transcendental process for reviving the original pure consciousness. By chanting this transcendental vibration, we can cleanse away all misgivings within our hearts. The basic principle of such misgivings is the false consciousness that I am the lord of all I survey.
Kåñëa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original natural energy of the living entity. In the beginning, there may be not the presence of all transcendental ecstasies, which are eight in number. There are: Being stopped as though dumb, perspiration, standing up of hairs on the body, dislocation of voice, trembling of the body, crying in ecstasy, trance. 
But there is no doubt that chanting for a while takes one immediately to the spiritual platform, and one shows the first symptom of this in the urge of dance along with the chanting of the mantra. We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in this chanting and dancing. The material energy, called mäyä, is also one of the multi-energies of the Lord. And we the living entities are also the energy, marginal energy, of the Lord. 
These three words, namely Harä, Kåñëa and Räma, are the transcendental seeds of the mahä-mantra. The chanting is a spiritual call for the Lord and His energies, to give protection to the conditioned soul. This chanting is exactly like the genuine cry of a child for its mother's presence. 
No other means of spiritual realization is as effective in this age of quarrel and hypocrisy as the mahä-mantra: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.

Vande 'ham means "I am offering my respectful obeisances." Vande. V-a-n-d-e. Vande means "offering my respectful obeisances." Aham. Aham means "I." Vande 'ham çré-gurün: all the gurus, or spiritual masters. The offering of respect direct to the spiritual master means offering respects to all the previous äcäryas. Gurün means plural number. All the äcäryas. They are not different from one another. Because they are coming in the disciplic succession from the original spiritual master and they have no different views, therefore, although they are many, they are one.
Vande 'ham çré-gurün çré-yuta-pada-kamalam. Çré-yuta means "with all glories, with all opulence." Pada-kamala: "lotus feet." Offering of respect to the superior begins from the feet, and blessing begins from the head. That is the system. The disciple offers his respect by touching the lotus feet of the spiritual master, and the spiritual master blesses the disciple by touching his head. Therefore it is said, "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of all the äcäryas.'' Çré-yuga-pada-kamalaà çré-gurün vaiñëaväàç ca. Gurün means spiritual master, and vaiñëaväàç ca means all their followers, devotees of Lord.
Spiritual master means they must have many followers. They are all Vaiñëavas. They are called prabhus, and the spiritual master is called prabhupäda, because on his lotus feet there are many prabhus. Pada means lotus foot. So all these Vaiñëavas, they are all prabhus. So they are also offered respectful... Not that the spiritual master alone, but along with his associates. And these associates are all Vaiñëavas, his disciples. They are also devotees of the Lord; therefore they should also be offered respectful obeisances. This is the process.
Then çré-rüpam. The spiritual master is descending from the six Gosvämés. Out of the six Gosvämés, Çré Rüpa Gosvämé and his elder brother Sanätana Gosvämé are heading the list. Çré-rüpaà sägrajätam. Agrajätam means his elder brother..., eldest brother. Çré-rupaà sägrajätaà saha-gaëa-raghunäthänvitam. They are also associated with other Gosvämés, two Raghunätha, raghunäthän, plural number. There were Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé and Raghunätha Bhaööa Gosvämé. Then Çré Jéva Gosvämé. 
So all they are offered respected obeisances one after another. And after finishing respectful obeisances to the spiritual master and the Gosvämés, then we approach Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya is also approached with His associates. 
[break] Sävadhütam, sädvaitam. Sa means "with.'' Advaita, Advaita Gosäi. And avadhüta means Nityänanda. So with Advaita and with Nityänanda, the offering goes to the Lord, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. 
So after finishing all these obeisances one after another, according to the system, then çré-rädhä-kåñëa-pädän, then we approach Rädhä and Kåñëa. Rädhä-Kåñëa is also associate. Kåñëa is associated with Rädhäräëé, and He is associated with Her immediate companions like Lalitä, Viçäkhä and others. 
So this is the process of offering respectful obeisances to the Deity. We cannot approach Rädhä-Kåñëa directly. We have to approach through the spiritual master, through the Gosvämés, through the associates of Lord Caitanya. Then we approach Rädhä, then Kåñëa. If one approaches Kåñëa through this channel of disciplic succession, his efforts becomes successful. Otherwise, if he wants to approach Kåñëa directly, it will be futile endeavor. [end]

I shall not be able to utter Your sweet Holy Name

 [MM 33]
[O Lord Kåñëa, at this moment let the royal swan of my mind enter the tangled stems of the lotus of Your feet. How will it be possible for me to remember You at the time of death, when my throat will be choked up with mucus, bile, and air?]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This verse, prayer, is taken from one book known as Mukunda-mälä-stotra. This prayer was offered by one king whose name was Kulaçekhara. He was a great king, at the same time a great devotee. There are many instances in the history of Vedic literature that the kings were very great devotees, and they are called räjarñés. Räjarñés means: although they are on the royal throne, they are all saintly persons. 
So this Kulaçekhara, King Kulaçekhara, is praying to Kåñëa that "My dear Kåñëa, the swan of my mind may now be entrapped with the stem of Your lotus feet. Because, at the point of death, the three elements of bodily functions, namely the mucus, and the bile, and the air, they will overlap, and there will be a choking in the voice, so I shall not be able to utter Your sweet Holy Name at the point of my death.'' 
The comparison is given in this way, that the white swan, whenever it finds a lotus flower, it goes there and sports by diving into the water and entangling him in the stem of the lotus flower. So King Kulaçekhara wants that in the healthy stage of his mind and body, he may be immediately entangled with the stem of the lotus feet of the Lord and die immediately. The idea is that one should take to Kåñëa consciousness while his mind and body is in good condition. 
Do not wait for the last stage of your life. Just go on practicing Kåñëa consciousness while your body and mind is a healthy state, and then at the time of death you shall be able to remember Kåñëa and His pastimes and be immediately transferred to the spiritual kingdom.

I shall not be able to utter Your sweet Holy Name

kåñëa tvadéya-pada-paìkaja-païjaräntam
adyaiva me viçatu mänasa-räja-haàsaù
präëa-prayäëa-samaye kapha-väta-pittaiù
kaëöhävarodhana-vidhau smaraëaà kutas te
 [MM 33]
[O Lord Kåñëa, at this moment let the royal swan of my mind enter the tangled stems of the lotus of Your feet. How will it be possible for me to remember You at the time of death, when my throat will be choked up with mucus, bile, and air?]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

[This] verse was sung by King Kulaçekhara, a great king, but at the same time, a great devotee of the Lord. His songs are recorded in the book known as Mukunda-mälä-stotra. That is very famous book. It is sung by many devotees. So it does not matter whether a man is king or a poor mendicant, everyone has the facility to become the greatest devotee of the Lord. 
So he's praying, "My dear Kåñëa, Your feet is lotus.'' Generally we say "lotus feet." But where the lotus flower is there, the white swans, they come to the lotus flower and try to play with the stem. They sport, going down the water, and be entangled with the stem of that lotus flower. That is their sporting. So King Kulaçekhara is praying that "Let the swan of my mind be immediately entered into the network of the stem of Your lotus feet.'' 
So that means he wants to engage his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord immediately. There is no question of delaying. He says that "Now I am in sound mind. If I think that I shall think of Your lotus feet at the time of death, there is no certainty. Because at the time of death, the whole body becomes dislocated. The whole function becomes dismantled."
The body's supposed to be conducted by three elements, kapha-pitta-väyu, cold and bile and air. So when these three elements work simultaneously, there is no disease in the body, but as soon as there is overlapping disruption of these three elements, the body becomes diseased. And when it is not possible to bring them again in their regulative principle, a man dies. That is the verdict of Äyurveda çästra. 
So death takes place when these three elements become overlapped with one another. And the symptom is that there is a sound on the throat which is called "garhh, garhh." That means the patient cannot speak. The throat is choked up, and he becomes suffocated and dies. So this is the last stage symptom of his body.
So King Kulaçekhara says, that "I cannot wait up to that time when everything will be topsy-turvied. Now my mind is sound. Let me enter immediately in the stem of Your lotus feet.'' That means he's praying, "Let me die in the sound condition of my life, so that I can think of Your lotus feet.'' In other words, he's giving us lessons that if we do not practice to engage our mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa when our mind is sound, how it is possible to think of Him at the time of death?

näma amani, udita haya,
bhakata-gétä-säme
[When the great soul Närada Muni plays his stringed véëä, the holy name, Rädhikä-ramaëa descends and immediately appears amidst the kértana of the Lord's devotees.]
This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. The purport of this song is that Närada Muni, the great soul, says, he's playing on his string instrument called véëä. Véëä is a string instrument carried by Närada Muni. So he is playing on the instrument as vibrating the sound rädhikä-ramaëa. Kåñëa's another name is Rädhika-Ramaëa. 
So as soon as he stroke on the string, immediately all the devotees began to respond him, and it becomes a very beautiful vibration. Amiya dhärä variñe ghana. And when the singing was going on with the string instrument, it appeared that there is a shower of nectarean. And all the devotees then in ecstasy they were dancing to the fullest extent of their satisfaction. 
Then, while they were dancing, it appeared that they became intoxicated by drinking the beverage called mädhuré püra. And as one becomes mad almost by drinking, similarly, in ecstasy, all the devotees they became mad. And some of them were crying, and some of them were dancing, and some of them, although they could not dance publicly, within their heart they were dancing. 
In this way, Lord Çiva immediately embraced Närada Muni, and he began to talk in ecstatic voice. And seeing Lord Çiva, he's dancing with Närada Muni, Lord Brahmä also joined, and he began to say, "All of you, kindly chant haribol, haribol!" In this way, gradually the king of heaven, Indra, he also joined with great satisfaction and began to dance and chant, "hari hari bol."
In this way, by the influence of transcendental vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe became ecstatic, and Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, "When the whole universe became ecstatic. Then my desire was satisfied and I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of Rüpa Gosvämé that let this chanting of hari-näma go on nicely like this."

This is a song sung by Locana Däsa Öhäkura, almost a contemporary of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu. He has got many books on the life and precepts of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu. So he is saying that Lord Nityänanda is full of good qualities, guëa-maëi. Guëa-maëi means the jewel of all qualities. So nitäi guëa-maëi ämär nitäi guëa-maëi. He is repeatedly uttering that Lord Nityänanda is the reservoir of all good qualities. 
Äniyä premera vanyä bhäsäilo avané. And on account of His spiritual qualities, he inundated the whole world by the flood of love of God. It is by His kindness people can feel what is love of God. Premer vanyä loiyä nitäi äilä gauòa-deçe. When Caitanya Mahäprabhu left home and took sannyas, He made His headquarter at Jagannätha Puré. So after His accepting the sannyas order, when He left His home and country Lord Nityänanda Prabhu also accompanied Him up to Jagannätha Puré. 
So after a few days, Lord Caitanya requested Him that "If both of us remain here, then who will preach in Bengal?" Bengal is known as gauòa-deçe. So under the order of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu, He brought from Him the flood of love of Godhead and He distributed the whole of Bengal, gauòa-deçe. And in that flood of love of God, all devotees became drowned. Only those who were not devotees, they could not drown but they were floating, déna héna bäche. But so far Nityänanda Prabhu is concerned, He does not make any discrimination between devotees and nondevotees. 
Déna héna patita pämara nähi bäche. Poor or rich or enlightened or foolish, everyone could take the instruction of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and become drowned in the ocean of love of Godhead. Such love of Godhead is brahmär durlabha. Even Lord Brahmä, who is the supreme teacher within this universe, he also cannot relish. But by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Nityänanda Mahäprabhu, this love of Godhead was distributed to everyone without any discrimination. So äbaddha karuëä-sindhu, it was just like a big ocean blocked all sides. Ocean of love of Godhead is a big ocean, but it was not inundated. 
So Nityänanda Prabhu cut a canal from the ocean, and He brought the canal in every door. Ghare ghare bule prema-amiyära bän. The flood of the nectar of love of Godhead was thus distributed in each and every home in Bengal. Actually still Bengal is overwhelmed when there is talk of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Nityänanda Prabhu. 
Locan bole, now the author is speaking on his behalf that anyone who does not take the advantage given by Lord Nityänanda Prabhu, so in his opinion he thinks that such a person knowingly is committing suicide.

The soothing shine of millions of moons

[sings: Nitäi-pada-kamala] [break]


Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Nitäi-pada-kamala, koöi-candra-suçétala, je chäyäy jagata juräy. 
[The lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda are a shelter where one will get the soothing moonlight not only of one but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have real peace, it should take shelter of Lord Nityänanda. Unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda, it will be very difficult for him to approach Rädhä-Kåñëa. If one actually wants to enter into the dancing party of Rädhä-Kåñëa, he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda.]
This is a very nice song sung by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. He is advising that nitäi-pada, the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda... Kamala means lotus feet, er, lotus, and pada means feet. So nitäi-pada-kamala means the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda. Koöi-candra-suçétala: it is just a shelter where you will get the soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. Just we have to imagine what is the aggregate total value of the soothing shine of millions of moons.
Koöi-candra-suçétala, je chäyäy jagata juräy. Jagat, this material world, which is progressing towards hell, and there is always a blazing fire, everyone is struggling hard, nobody finds peace. Therefore, if the world wants to have real peace, then it should take shelter under the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda, which is supposed to be cooling like the shining moon, millions in number. 
Nitäi-pada-kamala, koöi-candra-suçétala, je chäyäy jagata juräy. Juräy means relief. If you actually want relief from the struggle of existence, and if you actually want to extinguish the blazing fire of material pangs, then Narottama däsa Öhäkura advises, "Please take shelter of Lord Nityänanda.'' 
What will be the result of accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda? He says that heno nitäi bine bhäi: "Unless you take shelter under the shade of lotus feet of Nityänanda,'' rädhä-kåñëa päite näi, "it will be very difficult to approach Rädhä-Kåñëa.'' Rädhä-Kåñëa... 
This Kåñëa consciousness movement is for approaching Rädhä-Kåñëa, to be associated with the Supreme Lord in His sublime pleasure dance. That is the aim of Kåñëa consciousness. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura's advice is that "If you actually want to enter into the dancing party of Rädhä-Kåñëa, then you must take shelter of the lotus feet of Nityänanda."
Then he says, se sambandha nähi jä'r. Sambandha means connection, or contact. "So anybody who has not contacted a relationship with Nityänanda," se sambandha nähi jä'r, båthä janma gelo tä'r, "then he is supposed to have spoiled his human birth." In other song also, Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, hari hari biphale janama goìäinu [Prärthanä Song 4]: 
[O Lord Hari, I have wasted my life. Although I have taken this rare human birth, like a miser, I have not served Rädhä and Kåñëa, and thus I have knowingly drunk poison.]
"Anyone who does not approach Rädhä-Kåñëa through the relationship of Nityänanda, his life is uselessly spoiled.'' Se sambandha nähi jä'r, båthä janma gelo tä'r. Båthä means useless; janma means life; tära means his; and sambandha means relationship. So "Anyone who has no relationship with Nityänanda, he is simply spoiling his..., the boon of human form of life.'' 
Why he is spoiling? Se paçu boro duräcär. Se means that; paçu, animal; duräcär, dura, misbehaved, mostly misbehaved. Because without our elevation to Kåñëa consciousness through the mercy of Lord Caitanya-Nityänanda, the life is simply animal propensities. That's all. Sense gratification. 
And Narottama däsa Öhäkura says that ordinary animal, he can be tamed, but a human being, when he is animalistic, when he has simply animal propensities, oh, he is horrible; he cannot be tamed. Ordinary cats and dogs, even tiger, can be tamed. But a human being, when he goes out of his way, because human life is meant for being elevated to Kåñëa consciousness, if he doesn't take to that, then his higher intelligence will be simply misused for animal propensities, and it is very difficult to tame him.
The enactment of state laws cannot make a man, a thief, an honest man, because he cannot be tamed. His heart is polluted. Every man sees that a person committing criminal offense is punished by the government. And in scriptural injunction there is mention that "If you do this, you will be punished in the hell.'' 
He has heard from the scripture, and he has practically seen by the punishment of state laws. Still, he is not tamed. He cannot be tamed. So why? Because he hasn't got his relationship with Nityänanda. Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, duräcära. Duräcära means very much misbehaved. He cannot be tamed. Sei paçu boro duräcär.  
And what they are doing? Nitäi nä bolilo mukhe. They do not know who is Nityänanda, so never says "Lord Nityänanda'' or "Lord Caitanya.'' So nitäi nä bolilo mukhe, majilo saàsära-sukhe. Majilo means becomes absorbed, dipped into the so-called material enjoyment. They don't care who is Nityänanda or Caitanya. So nitäi nä bolilo mukhe. Because his life is animalistic, sei paçu boro duräcär, very difficult to be tamed, so he is going down, deep into this material existence.
Vidyä-kule ki koribe tär. Somebody may says, "Oh, why he is going to hell? He is so much educated, he has got academic qualification, he has got degrees." Narottama däsa Öhäkura replies, vidyä-kule ki koribe tär: "If he has no connection with Nityänanda and if he does not come to the Kåñëa consciousness, his vidyä, or his so-called academic education, and kula, and birth in high family or great nation, will not protect him, because nature's law will act." 
Either you are born in a very big family or nation, or either you have got a very advanced academic education, at the time of death your work will be judged and you will get another body according to that work. So vidyä kule ki koribe tär. 
Why they are doing so, these animals, human animals? Ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada päsariyä: "They have become maddened by a false concept of this bodily life." Ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada päsariyä: "And for this reason they have completely forgotten their eternal relationship with Nityänanda." 
Ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada päsariyä, asatyere satya kari mäni: "Such forgetful persons accept the illusory energy as fact." Asatyere. Asatya means which is not fact. In other words, it is called mäyä. Mäyä means which has no existence, a temporary illusion only. So such persons who have no contact with Nityänanda, they accept this illusion as fact, this illusory body as fact. Asatyere satya kori mäni.
Then he says, nitäiyer koruëä habe, braje rädhä-kåñëa päbe. He says that "If you actually want to approach the association of Rädhä-Kåñëa, then try to achieve the mercy of Lord Nityänanda. When He will be merciful upon you, then you will be able to approach Rädhä-Kåñëa.'' Dharo nitäi-caraëa duùkhäni. Narottama däsa Öhäkura advises us that "You firmly catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda.''
Then again he says, nitäiyer caraëa satya. One may not misunderstand that as he has caught hold of this mäyä, similarly, the lotus feet of Nityänanda may also be something like that mäyä, illusion. Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura confirms that nitäiyer caraëa satya: "The lotus feet of Nityänanda is not illusion; it is transcendental fact, satya.'' Nitäiyer caraëa satya, täìhära sevaka nitya: "And everyone who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of Nityänanda, he is also transcendental.'' 
If anyone is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord in Kåñëa consciousness, immediately he achieves his transcendental position, spiritual platform. And spiritual platform means eternal, blissful. So anyone who engages himself in the service of Nityänanda, it is supposed that he is also immediately in his eternal position. Nitäiyer caraëa satya, täìhära sevaka nitya, nitäi-pada sadä koro äça. Therefore he advises that "You always hope to catch the lotus feet of Nityänanda."

Appearance Day of Lord Nityananda
January 31st, 1969, Los Angeles

(1)
nitäi-pada-kamala, koöi-candra-suçétala
je chäyäy jagata juräy
heno nitäi bine bhäi, rädhä-kåñëa päite näi
[dåòha kori' dharo nitäir päy
The lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda are a shelter where one will get the soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have real peace, it should take shelter of Lord Nityänanda. Unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda, it will be very difficult for him to approach Rädhä-Kåñëa. If one actually wants to enter into the dancing party of Rädhä-Kåñëa, he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda.]
(2)
se sambandha nähi jä'r, båthä janma gelo tä'r
sei paçu boro duräcär
nitäi nä bolilo mukhe, majilo saàsära-sukhe
vidyä-kule ki koribe tär
[Anyone who has not established his relationship with Nityänanda Prabhu is understood to have spoiled his valuable human birth. Such a human being is actually an uncontrollable animal. Because he never uttered the holy name of Nityänanda, he has become merged into so-called material happiness. What can his useless education and family tradition do to help him?]
(3)
ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada päsariyä
asatyere satya kori mäni
nitäiyer koruëä habe, braje rädhä-kåñëa päbe
dharo nitäi-caraëa du'khäni
[Being maddened after false prestige and identification with the body, one is thinking, "Oh, what is Nityänanda? What can He do for me? I don't care." The result is that he is accepting something false to be truth. If you actually want to approach the association of Rädhä-Kåñëa, you must first achieve the mercy of Lord Nityänanda. When He is merciful toward you, then you will be able to approach Rädhä-Kåñëa. Therefore you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda.]
(4)
nitäiyer caraëa satya, tähära sevaka nitya
nitäi-pada sadä koro äça
narottama boro dukhé, nitäi more koro sukhé
räkho räìgä-caraëera päça
[The lotus feet of Nityänanda are not illusion; they are a fact. One who engages in the transcendental loving service of Nityänanda is also transcendental. Always try to catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda. This Narottama däsa is very unhappy, therefore I am praying to Lord Nityänanda to make me happy. My dear Lord, please keep me close to Your lotus feet.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Nitäi-pada-kamala, koti-candra-suçitala, je chäyäy jagata juräy. This is a song by Narottama däsa Öhäkura, a great äcärya of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava sampradäya. He has written many songs about the Vaiñëava philosophy, and they are approved as completely corresponding with Vedic instructions. So here Narottama däsa Öhäkura is singing that "The whole world is suffering under the blazing fire of material existence. Therefore, if one takes the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda...," whose birthday is today, 31st January, 1969. 
So we should relish this instruction of Narottama däsa Öhäkura that in order to get relief from the pangs of blazing fire of this material existence, one should take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityänanda because it is as cooling as the moon rays combined together of millions of moons. That means one will immediately find peaceful atmosphere. Just like a man works whole day and if he comes under the moonshine, he feels relief. Similarly, any materialistic man who comes under the shelter of Lord Nityänanda will immediately feel that relief.
Then he says, nitäi-pada-kamala, koöi-candra-suçitala, je chäyäy jagata juräy, heno nitäi bine bhäi, rädhä-kåñëa päite näi, dharo nitäi-caraëa du'khäni. He says that "If you are anxious to go back to home, back to Godhead, and become associate with Rädhä and Kåñëa, then the best policy is to take shelter of Nityänanda." Then he says, se sambandha nähi jä'r, båthä janma gelo tä'r: "One who has not been able to contact Nityänanda, then one should think of himself that he has simply spoiled his valuable life." Båthä janma gelo, båthä means for nothing, and janma means life. 
Gelo tä'r, spoiled. Because he has not made connection with Nityänanda. The Nityänanda, very name suggests... Nitya means eternal. Änanda means pleasure. Material pleasure is not eternal. That is the distinction. Therefore those who are intelligent, they are not interested with this flickering pleasure of material world. Every one of us, as living entity, we are searching after pleasure. But the pleasure which we are seeking, that is flickering, temporary. That is not pleasure. Real pleasure is nityänanda, eternal pleasure. So anyone who has no contact with Nityänanda, it is to be understood that his life is spoiled.
Se sambandha nähi jä'r, båthä janma gelo tä'r, sei paçu boro duräcär. Narottama däsa Öhäkura uses here very harsh word. He says that such human being is an animal, an uncontrollable animal. As there are some animals that cannot be tamed, so anyone who has not contacted Nityänanda, he should be considered as an untamed animal. Sei paçu boro duräcär. Why? Because nitäi nä bolilo mukhe: "He never uttered the holy name of Nityänanda." And majilo saàsära-sukhe, "and become merged into this material happiness." 
Vidyä-kule ki koribe tär. "That nonsense does not know that what will his education and family and tradition and nationality will help him?" These things cannot help him. These are all temporary things. Simply, if we want eternal pleasure, we must contact Nityänanda. Vidyä-kule ki koribe tär. Vidyä means education, and kula means family, nationality. So we may have a very nice family connection, we may have very nice national prestige, but after ending this body, these things will not help me. I'll carry my work with me, and according to that work, I shall have to accept by force another type of body. It may be something other than human body. So these things cannot protect us or give us the real pleasure. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura advises that vidyä-kule ki koribe tär.
Then he says, ahaìkäre matta hoiyä. "Being maddened after false prestige and identification..." False identification with the body and prestige of bodily relationship, it is called ahaìkäre matta hoiyä. One is mad after this false prestige. Ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada päsariyä. Due to this false prestige we are thinking, "Oh, what is Nityänanda? What can He do for me? I don't care." So these are the signs of false prestige. 
Ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada päsa..., asatyere satya kori mäni. The result is that I am accepting something which is false. For example, I am accepting this body. This body, I am not this body. Therefore, with false identification I am becoming entangled more and more. So one who is puffed up with this false prestige, ahaìkäre matta hoiyä, nitäi-pada pä..., asatyere satya kori mäni, he accepts something wrong as right.
Then he says, nitäiyer koruëä habe, braje rädhä-kåñëa päbe. If you are actually serious about going back to home, back to Godhead, then please seek after the mercy of Nityänanda. Nitäiyer koruëä habe, braja rädhä-kåñëa päbe, dharo nitäi-caraëa du'khäni: "Please catch up the lotus feet of Nityänanda." Then he says, nitäiyer caraëa satya. One may think that as we catch hold of so many shelter, but in this material world later on they prove false, similarly, suppose we catch hold of the lotus feet of Nityänanda, it may also prove false. But Narottama däsa Öhäkura assures that nitäiyer caraëa satya: "It is not false. Because Nityänanda is eternal, His lotus feet is also eternal." Tähära sevaka nitya. And anyone who takes to the service of Nityänanda, they also become eternal.
Without being eternal, nobody can serve the eternal. That is the Vedic injunction. Without becoming Brahman, one cannot approach the Supreme Brahman. Just like without being fire, nobody can enter into the fire. Without being water, nobody can enter into the water. Similarly, without being fully spiritualized, nobody can enter into the spiritual kingdom. 
So nitäiyer caraëa satya. If you catch the lotus feet of Nityänanda, then you become immediately spiritualized. Just like if you touch electricity, immediately you become electrified. That is natural. Similarly, Nityänanda is eternal happiness, if you touch Nityänanda some way or other, then you become also eternally happy. Tähära sevaka nitya. Therefore one who has in contact with Nityänanda, they have become eternal. Nitäiyer caraëa satya, tähära sevaka nitya, dåòha kori' dharo nitäir päy. So just catch Him very tightly.
Narottama boro duùkhé, nitäi more koro sukhé. At the last Narottama däsa Öhäkura, the composer of this song, he is appealing to Nityänanda, "My dear Lord, I am very unhappy. So You please make me happy. And You kindly keep me in corner of Your lotus feet." 
That is the sum and substance of this song.

The meaning of this mantra, that I offer my humble obeisances to Lord Nåsiàha, who is the source of bliss to Prahläda. But hiraëyakaçipu vakñaù, his father, Hiraëyakaçipu, on his chest the nails of His finger is just like chisel cutting the stone. The same Personality of Godhead is prahläda ähläda-däyine. Ähläda means pleasure. 
For Prahläda, prakåñöa-rüpeëa ähläda, Prahläda. A devotee is, being always in Kåñëa consciousness, naturally is in blissfulness. Still more when he meets or associates with his Lord, still more blissfulness. That is the position of the theist devotee. Whereas the atheist nondevotee, he is always feeling like a strike of the chisel, like, what do you call, stone-cutting chisel, nakha, nakhälaye, simply by the nails of His finger. 
All right. [end]

Just as one can easily crush a wasp between one’s fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasplike demon Hiraëyakaçipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your beautiful lotus hands.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Nåsiàhadeva may save you. Lord Nåsiàha, prahläda ähläda-däyine. And to the Hiraëyakaçipu, çilä-öaìka-nakhälaye. Both ways Kåñëa is protecting. And Viñëu, you see He has got four hands. In two hands He's carrying çaëkha, cakra, and in two hands gadä, padma. This çaìkha and padma is for the devotee, and gadä and cakra for the demon. Kåñëa says in the Bhagavad-gétä, yadä yadä hi..., pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm [Bg 4.8]. 
[In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.]
He has got two business: to give protection to the devotee and to kill the demons. But the result is one. He does good to the demons by killing him, and He does good to the devotees by giving him protection.
So Nåsiàhadeva will give you protection in my absence. I am now going to Japan to get some books printed personally, and after that my program is to go to India. Maybe I shall be able to establish some temples there. Of course, in India there are many temples, but it does not mean that I shall not also establish some temples. Just like there is overpopulation, it does not mean that one should not beget child. Similarly, there may be many hundreds of thousand temples in India, still our this Society, ISKCON, should have their own temples. That is the way since time immemorial. There are hundreds and thousands of temples. 
So my advice to you: I am old man. So even I may not return, you shall continue this Kåñëa consciousness movement. This is eternal, and I shall request you to keep the standard as I have already given you the program: the Deity worship, the kértana, the street saìkértana, distribution of literature, books. You should carry on this program with great enthusiasm. That is my request.
In the path of Kåñëa consciousness the first principle is enthusiasm. If you lack enthusiasm then other things will not happen. And you can keep enthusiastic if you follow the rules and regulation and chant regularly Hare Kåñëa mantra. Otherwise that enthusiasm also will dry. 
So six things are required for advancing Kåñëa consciousness. The first thing is enthusiasm. Utsähän dhairyät. And patient. And niçcayäd, with conviction, firm conviction. Utsähän dhairyät niçcayäd tat-tat-karma-pravartanät [Upadeçämåta 3]:
[There are six principles favorable to the execution of pure devotional service: (1) being enthusiastic, (2) endeavoring with confidence, (3) being patient, (4) acting according to regulative principles [such as çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëam [SB 7.5.23]—hearing, chanting and remembering Kåñëa], (5) abandoning the association of nondevotees, and (6) following in the footsteps of the previous äcäryas. These six principles undoubtedly assure the complete success of pure devotional service.]
Following the rules and regulation, chalked-out plans. And sato våtteù, dealing very straightforward. No diplomacy, no politics, no duplicity. That will not help you. Sato våtteù. Våtteù, his profession, should be very straightforward. No underhand dealings. Sato våtteù and sädhu-saìga [Cc Madhya 22.83], and in the association of devotees. 
[The root cause of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa is association with advanced devotees. Even when one’s dormant love for Kåñëa awakens, association with devotees is still most essential.]
Six things: enthusiasm, patience, firm conviction, following the rules and regulations, dealing straightforward, no duplicity, and in association of devotees. If you can keep these six principles always in front, then your progress in Kåñëa consciousness is sure. There is no doubt about it. So as far as possible I've tried to train you, and you are doing nice. I'm satisfied. So keep the standard and go on. March forward, and Kåñëa will bless you. 
Thank you very much. Hare Kåñëa. [devotees offer obeisances] 
Chant. [end]

[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, His incarnation Çré Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Çré Gadädhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Çréväsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu are complete when we say, 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda 
çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
As preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by chanting this Païca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Païca-tattva mantra, namely, 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda 
çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. 
[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is known as mahä-vadänyävatära, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahä-mantra [Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare], we must first take shelter of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, learn the Païca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. That will be very effective.

Thank you very much.

9th December, 1968, Los Angeles
Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Hare Kåñëa. I was thinking of “Where is Jayänanda?” now immediately he has come. 
[someone brings some kind of offering and Çréla Prabhupäda says to give it to his Guru Mahäräja] 
Ah. Thank you very much. Take care it may not fall down. All right.
Mmmm. So today is the disappearance day of my Guru Mahäräja. As I told you that sädhava jéva mä maro vä. There was a nice story the other day I told you that a sage is giving different kinds of blessings to different types of persons. So to a king’s son, a prince, he blessed, räja-putra ciraà jéva: “Oh, you are king’s son, prince, you live forever.” And muni-putra, the son of a saintly person, he blessed him, mä jéva mä jéva: “You don’t live.” Räja-putra ciraà jéva muni-putra mä jéva. And sädhu, devotees, he blessed him, jéva vä maro vä: “Either you live or you die, as you like.” And there was a butcher, he blessed him, mä jéva mä mara: “You don’t die, don’t live.” So these words are very significant. That I have already explained, still I am explaining. 
A prince, he’s enjoying sense, that’s all. He has got enough facility for sense enjoyment. So his next life is hellish. Because if you indulge in sex life, then Kåñëa will give you facility to have sex life three times in an hour, just like the pigeons, the monkeys, the sparrows, they are very sexually strong. You have seen it. So the facility is given. So princely order, they are after sense enjoyment. So he’s blessed that “Better you live forever because after your death, you do not know what is going to happen to you, you are going to get a hellish life. Better you live for some time. Go on with your enjoyment.” And muni-putra mä jéva. Brahmacäré, working under the guidance, under strict disciplinary guidance of his spiritual master, he is blessed, mä jéva, “You better die. Because you are so trained to enter into the kingdom of God, so why should you take so much trouble? Better you die and go back to Godhead.” Mä jéva. And a devotee he blessed, jéva va maro va: “My dear devotee, either you live or die, the same thing.” And the butcher, he blessed him, ma jéva ma mara: “You don’t live, don’t die.” What he’s to do? His living condition is so abominable. From the morning, he has to slaughter so many animals, see the bloodstain, the ghastly scene. That is his livelihood. So what a horrible life this is. So “Don’t live. And don’t die also.” Because after death, oh, he is going to be in so much hellish condition, nobody can describe. So both life, living condition and death, after death, his condition is very horrible.
Anyway, apart from others, the devotee, for him, appearance and disappearance the same thing. Just like when my spiritual master appeared at Jagannätha Puré... He was the son of a very big government officer, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. He was magistrate, government officer. In those days a magistrate is a big officer in the government, practically next to governor. And Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura was in charge of the Jagannätha temple. That is the system in Jagannätha Puré. The manager in charge of the temple is the district magistrate. So there was a Ratha-yäträ festival, and the car was passing in front of Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura’s house. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura’s name was Kedaranath Datta. When he was magistrate, he was known as K.N. Datta. Kedaranath Datta. So the car stopped before his house, and at that time, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a child in the lap of his mother. The mother took the opportunity of rising on the car. He [She] was magistrate’s wife, so he [she] had the facility. Immediately, people gave her way to go on the top of the car and place the child on the lotus feet of Jagannätha. And there were many garlands. One garland fell upon him, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, blessings. This was one of the... There were so many other things.
When he was a child two, three years old, he ate one mango fruit which was kept for offering to the Deity. So his father mildly rebuked him, “Oh, you have done very wrong thing. It was meant for Deity, and you have taken it. You should not have done it.” The child was two or three years old. He took it so seriously that never after that he took mango. Whenever we offered him mango he said, “No, I am offender. I cannot take mango.” He was thinking like that, you see. Never in his life he took a mango. He was thinking that “I offended in my childhood by taking the mango of the Deity.” This is the characteristic of äcärya. They teach by their life’s action that one should be so much determined, that one should not be... A child took the mango, there was no offense. But he took that vow.
Another instance, in my presence. At that time, we were also young men, and one of my Godbrothers, his name is Dr. Oul Bihari Kapoor... He’s now retired in Våndävana, last time I saw him. He was also young man, and his wife was also young. So we were sitting together, talking with Guru Mahäräja, and the girl proposed, “My dear master, I want to speak with you.” So Guru Mahäräja said, “Yes, you can talk whatever you like.” So she said, “I want to talk with you secretly, not in the presence of everyone.” Guru Mahäräja said, “No, I cannot talk with you secretly. You can talk in the presence of my all other disciples.” So even that girl was just like his granddaughter by age calculation, he refused to talk with a young woman in a secret place. These are the instances.
So in his life he was akhaëòa brahmacäré. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura had many other sons, and he was the fifth son. And some of his other brother also, they did not marry. And my Guru Mahäräja, he also did not marry. From the childhood he is strict brahmacäré, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja. And he underwent very severe penances for starting this movement, worldwide movement. That was his mission. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura wanted do this. He, 1896, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura wanted to introduce this Kåñëa consciousness movement by sending his this book, Shree Chaitanya Mahäprabhu, His Life and Precepts. Fortunately, that year was my birth year, and by Kåñëa’s arrangement, we came in contact. I was born in a different family, my Guru Mahäräja was born in a different family. Who knew that I will come to his protection? Who knew that I would come in America? Who knew that you American boys will come to me? These are all Kåñëa’s arrangement. We cannot understand how things are taking place. In 1936... Today is 9th December, 1938[68]. That means thirty-two years ago. In Bombay, I was then doing some business. All of a sudden, perhaps on this date, sometimes between 9 or 10 December. At that time, Guru Mahäräja was indisposed little, and he was staying at Jagannätha Puré, on the seashore. So I wrote him letter, “My dear master, your other disciples, brahmacäré, sannyäsé, they are rendering you direct service. And I am a householder. I cannot live with you, I cannot serve you nicely. So I do not know how can I serve you?” Simply an idea, I was thinking of serving him, “How can I serve him seriously?” 
So the reply was dated 13th December, 1936. In that letter he wrote, “My dear such and such, I am very glad to receive your letter. I think you should try to push our movement in English.” That was his writing. “And that will do good to you and to the people who will help you.” That was his instruction. And then in 1936, on the 31st December—that means just after writing this letter a fortnight before his departure—he passed away. But I took that order of my spiritual master very seriously. But I did not think that I’ll have to do such and such thing, I was at that time a householder. But this is the arrangement of Kåñëa. If we strictly try to serve the spiritual master, his order, then Kåñëa will give us all facilities. That is the secret. Although there was no possibility, I never thought, but I took it little seriously by studying a commentary by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura on the Bhagavad-gétä. In the Bhagavad-gétä, the verse vyavasäyätmikä-buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana. [Bg 2.41]
[Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.]
In connection with that verse, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives his commentary that we should take up the words from the spiritual master as our life and soul. We should try to carry out the instruction, the specific instruction of the spiritual master, very rigidly, without caring for our personal benefit or loss.
So I tried a little bit in that spirit. So he has given me all facilities to serve him. Things have come to this stage, that in this old age I have come to your country, and you are also taking this movement seriously, trying to understand it. We have got some books now. So there is little foothold of this movement. Now on this occasion of my spiritual master’s departure, as I am trying to execute his will, similarly, I shall also request you to execute the same order through my will. I am an old man, I can also pass away at any moment. That is nature’s law. Nobody can check it. So that is not very astonishing. But my appeal to you on this auspicious day of the departure of my Guru Mahäräja, that at least to some extent you have understood the essence of Kåñëa consciousness movement. You should try to push it on. People are suffering for want of this consciousness. As we daily pray about devotees,
väïchä-kalpatarubhyaç ca
kåpä-sindhubhya eva ca
patitänäà pävanebhyo
vaiñëavebhyo namo namaù
[I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiñëava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.]
A Vaiñëava, or devotee of Lord, his life is dedicated for the benefit of the people. You know—most of you belong to Christian community—how Lord Jesus Christ, he said that for your sinful activities he has sacrificed himself. That is the determination of devotee of the Lord. They don’t care for personal comforts. Because they love Kåñëa or God, therefore they love all living entities because all living entities are in relationship with Kåñëa. So similarly you should learn. This Kåñëa consciousness movement means to become Vaiñëava and feel for the suffering humanity. But to feel for the suffering humanity, there are different angles of vision. Somebody is thinking of the suffering of the humanity from bodily conception of life. Somebody is trying to open hospital to give relief to the diseased condition. Somebody is trying to distribute foodstuff in poverty-stricken countries or places. 
These things are certainly very nice, but actual suffering of the humanity is due to lack of Kåñëa consciousness. These bodily sufferings, they are temporary, neither they can be checked by the laws of nature. Suppose if you give some distribution of foodstuff in some poverty-stricken country, that does not mean that this help makes solution of the whole problem. The real beneficial work is to invoke every person to Kåñëa consciousness. As soon as he comes to Kåñëa consciousness... The same example, as I have given several times, that a rich man’s son is loitering in the street, forgetting his father’s opulence and property. And somebody, out of sympathy, giving him some food. But other person comes to him and says, “Oh, my dear boy, I know you. You are the son of such and such rich man. Why you are loitering in the street? Come on, I shall take you to your father.” So if that gentleman takes that loitering boy to his father, the father is glad, and the boy inherits his father’s property, and his whole problem of life becomes solved. This is a crude example. Similarly, all living entities, they are loitering within this universe in different bodies, in different planets, and from time immemorial, without knowing that he belongs to the kingdom of God, he is the direct son of Kåñëa and God, that Kåñëa is the proprietor of everything, and he can enjoy his father’s property, and these problems of material conditioned life automatically solved. Just like if you become a rich man, if you can possess millions of dollars, then your poverty is automatically solved. Similarly, if you become Kåñëa conscious, if you act in that way, then all other problems in the material conditional life—solved.
So this is such a nice movement. Ahaà tvaà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù [Bg 18.66]. 
[Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.]
The Bhagavad-gétä says, the Lord says, people’s sufferings are due to his sinful activities. Ignorance. Ignorance is the cause of sinful activity. Just like a man does not know. Suppose a foreigner like me comes in America and he does not know... Because in India... Just like in your country, the car is driven from the right side; in India, I’ve seen in London also, the car is driven from the left side. So suppose if he does not know, he drives the car on the left side and incurs some accident, and he is taken by the police custody. And if he says, “Sir, I did not know that here the car is driven from the right side,” that does not make him excused. The law will punish him. So ignorance is the cause of breaking the law, or sinful activities. And as soon as you commit some sinful activity, you have to suffer the result. So the whole world is in ignorance, and due to ignorance he’s complicated in so many actions and reactions, either good or bad. There is nothing good within this material world, everything is bad. So we have manufactured something good and something bad. Here... Because in the Bhagavad-gétä we understand this place is duùkhälayam açäçvatam [Bg 8.15]. 
[After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogés in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.]
This place is for misery. So how you can say, in miserable condition, how you can say that “This is good” or “This is bad.” Everything is bad. So those persons who do not know—the material, conditional life—they manufacture something, “This is good, this is bad,” because they do not know everything here is bad, nothing good. One should be very much pessimistic of this material world. Then he can make advance in spiritual life. Duùkhälayam açäçvatam. This place is full of miseries, and if you study analytically you’ll find simply miserable condition. Therefore, the whole problem is that we should give up our material conditional life, and in Kåñëa consciousness we should try to elevate ourself to the spiritual platform and thereby be promoted to the kingdom of Godhead, yad gatvä na nivartante tad dhämaà paramaà mama [Bg 15.6], where going, nobody comes back to this miserable world. And that is the supreme abode of the Lord.
[That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.]
So there are description in the Bhagavad-gétä. So this Kåñëa consciousness movement is authorized, very important. Now, you American boys and girls who have taken to this movement, please take it more seriously and... That is the mission of Lord Caitanya and my Guru Mahäräja, and we are also trying to execute the will by disciplic succession. You have come forward to help me. I shall request you all that I shall go away, but you shall live. Don’t give up pushing on this movement, and you’ll be blessed by Lord Caitanya and His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Goswami Prabhupäda.
Thank you very much. [end]

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

’Rädhä-kåñëa’ bolo bolo bolo re sobäi. This is a song sung by Öhäkura Bhaktivinode. It is said that Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda, They are walking through the streets of the of Nadéyä town chanting this instruction, addressing everyone. They say, “You all people, please chant Rädhä-Kåñëa or Hare Kåñëa.” ’Rädhä-kåñëa’ bolo bolo bolo re sobäi. “Every one of you, simply chant Rädhä-Kåñëa or Hare Kåñëa.” This is the instruction. Ei çikhä diyä. Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityänanda, both together, while walking and dancing through the street, He was instructing that “All of you simply say Rädhä-Kåñëa.” Ei çikhä diyä, sab nadéyä, phirche [abhay?] gaura-nitäi. Phirche, phirche means walking. All over the town Nadéyä They were teaching this. Ei çikhä diyä, sab nadéyä, phirche [abhay?] gaura-nitäi. 
Then he says, [keno?] mäyär boçe, jäccho bhese’, “Why you are being washed away on the waves of this mäyä, material nescience?” Khäccho häbuòubu, bhäi. “And whole day and night you are merged into full of anxieties, simply. Just like a man, when he is put into the water, sometimes drowning, sometimes coming up, but he is struggling very hard. Similarly, in the ocean of mäyä, why you are so much struggling? Sometimes being drowned, sometimes coming up, sometimes feeling happiness, sometimes no happiness. Actually, there is no happiness. In the water, if you are put into the water, and if you are sometimes drowned and sometimes come out, that does not mean happiness. To come out for the temporary time, for the time being, and again being drowned up, that is not happiness.” 
So Caitanya Mahäprabhu is instructing that “Why you are troubling so much,” mäyär boçe, “under the spell of mäyä?” Then what is to be done? He says that jév kåñëa-däs, e viçväs, “Simply just believe it that you are servant of God, you are servant of Kåñëa.” Jév kåñëa-däs, e viçväs, korle to’ är duùkha näi: “As soon as you come to this point that you are servant of God or servant of Kåñëa, immediately all your troubles become ceased. There is no more trouble.” 
So this instruction is given by Lord Caitanya walking over the streets. Jév kåñëa-däs, e viçväs, korle to’ är duùkha näi. Then Bhaktivinode Öhäkura gives his own personal experience. He says, jay sakal vipod, “I become released from all kinds of dangers.” Gäi bhaktivinod. Bhaktivinode Öhäkura, he is äcärya, he is experienced, he says that “Whenever I chant Rädhä-Kåñëa or Hare Kåñëa, I become freed from all kinds of dangers.” 
Jay sakal vipod. Jakhon ami o-näm gäi, “Whenever I chant this Holy Name, Hare Kåñëa or Rädhä-Kåñëa, immediately all my dangers are over.” ’Rädhä-kåñëa’ bolo, saìge calo. So Lord Caitanya therefore says that “I am walking on the street and begging from you. What is that begging? That you simply chant. This is my request, begging.” ’Rädhä-kåñëa’ bolo, saìge calo. “And just follow Me.” ’Rädhä-kåñëa’ bolo, saìge calo, ei-mätra bhikñä cäi, “I am simply asking you for this contribution, that you chant Hare Kåñëa and follow Me so that your struggle for existence in this material ocean will cease.”

[Anyone who simply chants the name of Çré Kåñëa Caitanya will immediately develop love of Godhead. I offer him all congratulations by saying, "Bravo!"

[Anyone who takes pleasure sporting within the waves of the ocean of Lord Caitanya's distribution of love of God immediately becomes a confidential devotee of Çré Çré Rädhä-Mädhava. It doesn't matter whether such a devotee is in the renounced order of life or whether he is a householder. If he is actually taking part in Lord Caitanya's saìkértana activities and actually understanding what it is, then such a person is always liberated. Narottama däsa aspires for his association.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Gauräìgera duöi pada, yära dhana sampada, sei jäne bhakati-rasa-sära. This is another song composed by Narottama das Öhäkura, and he says that "One who has accepted the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya, in other words, one who has the only asset of possession, the two feet of Lord Caitanya, such person is supposed to know what is the essence of devotional service." 
Sei jäne bhakati-rasa-sära. What is the purport of devotional service, or what is the humor of devotional service, can be understood by a person who has accepted Lord Caitanya's lotus feet as everything. The idea is that actually Lord Caitanya, He is Kåñëa Himself, and He is teaching devotional service to the living entities personally, directly. Therefore the modes of devotional service, as taught by Lord Caitanya, is the most perfect. There cannot be any doubt. 
The expert, or the master, is teaching the servant how to work. If somebody is master of some engineering work and he is personally teaching some assistant, that teaching, instruction, is most perfect. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa Himself, in the role of a devotee, is teaching devotional service. Therefore the path chalked out by Lord Kåñëa is the most feasible way for perfection to devotional service. Sei jäne bhakati rasa sära. Sära means essence.
And then he says, gauräìgera madhuri-lélä, yära karëe praveçilä. Now he comes to the pastimes of Lord Caitanya. He says that "Lord Caitanya's pastimes are also as much transcendental as Lord Kåñëa's." As in the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that anyone who can simply understand the transcendental appearance, disappearance, activities, work of Kåñëa, he immediately becomes eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. Simply by understanding the pastimes and the work, transcendental activities of Kåñëa. Similarly, one who enters into the pastimes of Lord Caitanya, he immediately becomes freed from all contamination of the heart. Gauräìgera madhuri-lélä, yära karëe praveçilä. Karëe praveçilä means simply one has to receive the message of Lord Caitanya. Karëe means in the ear. To give the message a submissive aural reception. Then immediately one's heart becomes freed from all material contamination.
Then he says: yei gauräìgera näma laya, tära haya premodaya. The devotees are concerned how to develop love of Godhead. Narottama däsa Öhäkura recommends that anyone who simply chants çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu-nityänanda...'' Gauräìga means with all this paraphernalia. As soon as we speak of gauräìga, we should mean the five: Lord Nityänanda, Advaita, Gadädhara, and Çréväsa. All together. So yei gauräìgera näma laya, anyone who chants, immediately he will develop love of Godhead. Yei gauräìgera näma laya, tara haya premodaya, täre mui jaya bole hari. Narottama däsa Öhäkura says "I offer him all congratulations.'' Because it is certain that he has developed love of Godhead. Then he says, gauräìga-guëete jhure, nitya-lélä täre sphure. Anyone, if he cries by simply by hearing the transcendental qualities of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, he at once understands what is the loving affairs between Rädhä and Kåñëa.
Nitya-lélä means the pastimes, or the loving exchange, affairs between Rädhä and Kåñëa, that is eternal. That is not temporary. We should not think that Rädhä-Kåñëa pastimes, loving affairs, is just like the business of a young boy or girl, as we see in this material world. Such loving affairs is not at all loving affairs. They are lusty affairs, and they are not eternal. Therefore they break. Today I am in love with somebody and next day it breaks. But Rädhä-Kåñëa lélä is not like that. It is eternal. Therefore that is transcendental and this is temporary. So simply one who is absorbed in the pastimes of Lord Caitanya, he can immediately understand what is the actual position of the loving affairs of Rädhä-Kåñëa. Nitya-lélä täre sphure. Sei yaya rädhä-mädhava, sei yaya vrajendra-suta päça. And simply by doing that, he becomes eligible to enter into the abode of Kåñëa. Vrajendra-suta. Vrajendra-suta means the son of Nanda Mahäräja in Våndävana. He's sure to go to associate with Kåñëa in his next birth.
Gauräìgera saìge-gaëe, nitya-siddha boli mäne. Anyone who has understood that the associates of Lord Caitanya, they are not ordinary conditioned souls... They are liberated souls. Nitya-siddha bole mäni. There are three kinds of devotees. One is called sädhana-siddha. Sadhana-siddha means by following the regulative principles of devotional service, if one becomes perfect, he's called sädhana-siddha. Another devotee is called kåpä-siddha. Kåpä-siddha means even if he has not followed strictly all the regulative principle, still, by the mercy of äcärya or a devotee, or by Kåñëa, he is elevated to the perfectional stage. That is special. And another devotee is called nitya-siddha. Nitya-siddha means they were never contaminated. The sädhana-siddha and kåpä-siddha was contaminated by material touch, and by following regulative principles or by the mercy or grace of some devotee and äcärya they're elevated to the perfectional state. But nitya-siddha means they were never contaminated. They're ever liberated. So all the associates of Lord Caitanya, just like Advaita Prabhu, Çréväsa, Gadädhara, Nityänanda, they are Viñëu-tattva. They are all liberated. Not only they, the Gosvämés... There are many others. So they are ever-liberated. So one who can understand that the associates of Lord Caitanya are ever-liberated... Nitya-siddha bale mäni, sei yaya vrajendra suta-päça. Immediately he becomes eligible to enter into the abode of Kåñëa.
And then he says, gauòa-maëòala-bhümi, yebä jäni cintämaëi. The gauòa-maëòala means the place in West Bengal wherein Lord Caitanya had His pastimes. In Navadvépa, during Lord Caitanya's birth anniversary, the devotees go and circumambulate different places of Lord Caitanya's pastimes. It takes nine days. So that portion of Bengal is called gauòa-maëòala. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, "One who understands that there is no difference between this part of the country with Våndävana," tära haya vraja-bhümi väsa, "it is as good as one lives in Våndävana." Then he says, gaura-prema rasärëarve. Lord Caitanya's activities is just like an ocean of loving affairs of Kåñëa. 
Therefore one who takes a dip into this ocean, gaura-prema-rasärëave, sei taraìga yebä òube. Just like we take a dip and bath, and we play, sport, in the waves of the ocean or sea. Similarly, one who takes pleasure, taking a dip and sporting with the waves of the ocean of Lord Caitanya's distribution of love of God, such a person becomes immediately a confidential devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Sei rädhä-mädhava-antaraìga. Antaraìga means not ordinary devotee. They are confidential devotee. And Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, gåhe vä vanete thäke. "Such devotee, who is taking pleasure in the waves of Lord Caitanya's movement," because he has become a very confidential devotee of the Lord...
Therefore Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, "Such devotee, it doesn't matter whether he's in the renounced order of life or whether he is a householder." Gåha. Gåha means householder. So Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement does not say that one has to become a renounced order, sannyäsé. Just like Mäyävädé sannyäsés, impersonalists, Çaìkaräcärya, they first, they put the first condition that "You take up the renounced order of life first, and then talk of spiritual advancement." So in Çaìkara sampradäya nobody is accepted as bona fide impersonalist unless he has accepted the renounced order of life. But here, in Caitanya's movement, there is no such restriction. 
Advaita Prabhu, He was a householder. Nityänanda, He was householder. Gadädhara, He was also householder. And Çréväsa, he was also householder. And Caitanya Mahäprabhu also married twice. So it doesn't matter. Narottama däsa Öhäkura says that to become in renounced order of life, or to remain in householder life, that does not matter. If he is actually taking part in the movements of Caitanya's saìkértana activities and actually understanding what it is, he is taking sport in the waves of such devotional ocean, then such person is always liberated. And Narottama däsa Öhäkura is aspiring his association ever increasingly. That is the sum and substance of this song.

			Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

The materialistic demeanor cannot possibly stretch to the transcendental autocrat who is ever inviting the fallen conditioned soul to associate with Him through devotion or eternal serving mood. The phenomenal attractions are often found to tempt sentient being to enjoy the variegated position which is opposed to undifferenced monism. 
People are so much apt to indulge in transitory speculation even when they are to educate themselves on the situation beyond their empiric area or experiencing jurisdiction and almost foolishly they dare to declare that God is dead. The songs of Brahma-saàhitä as cintämaëi-prakara-sadmasu, will surely help such souls in their march toward the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual kingdom which is lying beyond their sensuous gaze of inspection.
The so-called astronomers cannot even definitely give us information of the visible sky which is overflooded with sunlight during daytime and moonlight at night. We can, however, learn about spiritual kingdom from the Bhagavad-gétä that it is situated far, far beyond the visible sky and in that sky there is no need of sunlight or moonlight or even electricity. 
There are innumerable spiritual planets in that self-effulgent sky and the gross estimate of that sky is given in the Bhagavad-gétä that the material world wherein there are innumerable suns and moons is only one-fourth of the whole kingdom of God. This material world is also part of the kingdom of God, but this kingdom of God is described as made of inferior energy on account of its temporary nature and is compared with a mass of clouds in the sky. 
When there is a mass of clouds in the sky there is certainly torrents of rain and there is a type of creation of new vegetation on account of such rainfall. But in spite of all such variegatedness, manifestation of greenery scene, of fruits and flowers, the whole show is only temporary. When the season is over, everything fades away into different situations and the temporary manifestation comes to an end.
Therefore the material world is called three phases of existence, namely creation, sustenance, and dissolution at last. This creation and dissolution is going on perpetually like seasonal changes and the portion of the vast sky where such temporary variegatedness is taking place and again becoming out of sight, is called the material world. 
And beyond this material manifestation of variegatedness, there is the world of spiritual sky where everything is eternal, full of life, blissful and knowledge distinct from the non-eternal, miserable existence of ignorance. In the material world everything is struggling hard for existence but the cruel laws of material nature will not allow anybody to exist although everyone of us aspires to exist eternally in full blissful life of perfect knowledge.
This information is available in the Brahma-saàhitä that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kåñëa, and His transcendental form is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. In the spiritual world, not only Kåñëa has His eternal body full of bliss and knowledge, but also everyone who associates with Kåñëa has the same spiritual nature. In the abode of Kåñëa which is called Cintämaëi-dhäma [Bs 5.29], the land, the trees, the animals, the residents, everything is of the same spiritual nature as that of Kåñëa. 
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakñmés or gopés.]
This spiritual nature is expansion of interior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa is called the cause of all causes.
It is said that Brahmä, who wrote Brahma-saàhitä after his mature knowledge by meditation, it was revealed in him that by the recollection of bhakti-yoga, it appeared to him that he is the eternal maid-servant of Kåñëa. Though other mysteries in regard to the condition of the maid-servant of Kåñëa were not revealed to him, Brahmä by dint of his searching self-consciousness became well acquainted with the ocean of truth. 
All the truths of the Vedas were revealed to him and with the help of those essence of the Vedas, he offered this hymn to the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa. Çréman Mahäprabhu, Lord Caitanya has taught this hymn to His favorite disciples in as much as it fully contains all the transcendental truths regarding Vaiñëava philosophy. The audience, the hearers of this record are requested to study and try to enter into the spirit of this hymn with great care and attention as a regular daily function.
The first verse is translated: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, fulfilling all desires, in the abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakñmés, or gopés. By the word cintämaëi is meant transcendental gem. Just as mäyä builds the mundane universe with the five material elements, so the spiritual cit potency has built the spiritual world of transcendental gems. 
The cintämaëi which serves as material in the building of the above Supreme Lord's place, Goloka, is a far rarer and more agreeable entity than the philosopher's stone. The purpose tree only, the fruits of piety, wealth, fulfillment of desires and liberation but the purpose trees in the abode of Kåñëa bestows innumerable fruits yielding the fulfillment of desire or oceans of milk in the shape of the fourteen love-showering transcendental bliss that take away with the hunger and thirst of all pure devotees. The trees in the abode of Lord Kåñëa can supply anything desired by the devotees. 
The devotees residing in the abode of Kåñëa have not desired to fulfill. Still, there are variegated transcendental desires of the devotees to satisfy their eternal Lord in loving service. In the material world a tree can supply only the fruits that it can produce but in the spiritual world any tree can supply any amount of fruits or any variety of fruits to the aspirant devotee.
The second verse is translated: "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept on playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals, with head bedecked with peacock feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of gopés." The matchless beauty of Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, or Govinda is being described. Kåñëa, the all-pervading cognisant has the spiritual form of youth. 
The form of Kåñëa is not a fanciful creation of imagination formed after visualizing the beautiful things of the world like the poet or the artist. When Brahmä saw in his ecstasy trance of pure devotion, He is being described. Kåñëa is engaged in playing upon His flute, that attracts the hearts of all living beings. Just as a lotus petal produces a pleasant sight, so the two beautiful eyes of Kåñëa, who causes the manifestation of our spiritual vision, display the unlimited splendor and beauty of His moon-like face. 
The loveliness that adorns His head with peacock feather is gorgeous. The surrounding feature of the spiritual beauty of Kåñëa, just as a mass of blue clouds offer a specifically soothing pleasant view, the complexion of Kåñëa is analogously tinged with a spiritual dark blue color. The beauty and loveliness of Kåñëa is far more enchanting than that of Cupid multiplied a million-fold.
The next verse is translated: "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, around whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with flute and jeweled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of Çyämasundara is eternally manifested." 
In the çloka beginning with cintämaëi-prakara-sadmasu, the transcendental region and the spiritual names of Govinda in the çloka beginning with govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi, the eternal beautiful form of Govinda, and in this çloka the amorous pastimes of Govinda, praëaya-keli, means the amorous pastimes of Govinda, the embodiment of sixty-four excellences have been described. 
All the spiritual affairs have come within this scope of description and the narration of the ecstatic mellow qualities, rasa, are included in the spiritual amorous order of Govinda. Lord Kåñëa, Govinda is always visible with His eternal consort, Rädhäräëé. This conjugal living pair is called by Narottama Däsa Öhäkura as yugala-périti. Yugala-périti means conjugal love. The conjugal love is existing originally in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and that is reflected only in the material world in a perverted form.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This verse is particularly important, because it describes the significance of sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù [Bs 5.1]. 
[Kåñëa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.]
The Lord's body is sac-cid-änanda. His body is not like ours. Our body is acit and..., asat, acit and niränanda, just the opposite. Asat means it will not exist, and acit means it is full of ignorance, and niränanda... Niränanda means full of miseries. These three qualification of our body, whereas the Lord's body is sac-cid-änanda: it is eternal and full of knowledge and full of bliss. 
Our body and with our self... My body and my self are different. But Lord and Lord's body is absolute. What is Lord, Lord's body is also the same. So that description is given here: aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våtti-manti. The Lord is not impersonal. He has got His form. And what sort of form? We should not consider that whenever there is a question of form, the form must be just like one of us. This is foolishness. Now, His form is completely different, just like we have explained. His form is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, and our this present material body is asat, acit and niränanda. Just completely different. 
So His form, His different parts of the body, described in the Vedas, apäëi-pädo javano grahétä paçyati... [Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 3.19]: 
[The Supreme Lord has no material hands and feet but accepts whatever is offered to Him and moves very quickly. The Supreme Person has no material ears and eyes but sees and hears everything. He is the knower of everything, and He is all that is to be known. It is said that He is the best and the greatest of all persons.]
"He has no hands and legs; still, He accepts all that you offer to Him.'' In the Bhagavad-gétä also we'll find that,
patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà
yo me bhaktyä prayacchati
tad ahaà bhakty-upahåtam
açnämi prayatätmanaù
 [Bg 9.26]
[If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.]
"My devotees..." God is not... The Lord is not in need of our offering, but still, He is so kind, if we offer Him something... Patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam. Not that we have to offer him very luxurious things, very highly valuable things. He says that even a piece of leaf, patraà, a piece of flower, patraà puñpam, a piece of fruit and little water... That means these four things can be secured by any poor man in any part of the world. There is no botheration for securing a piece of leaf, a piece of flower a little water or a piece of fruit. Any poor man, any rich man can secure. 
And the Lord says, patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà yo me bhaktyä prayacchati [Bg 9.26]: 
"Anyone who offers Me these four things with devotion, with love, I accept them." "I accept them." Why? Now, tad ahaà bhaktyä upahåtam açnämi: "Because that is secured with sincere love for Me." So God..., the Lord accepts our love.
Now, the Lord is... We cannot see. He is far, far away, and still, He is within us. Therefore His hand is not like our hands. The Vedas... When the Vedas describes, "The Lord has no hand," that means He has no hand like ours, not that a two-feet hand which we have got, or two- or three-feet hand; largest hand. His hand is so large that He can extend His hand in any part of His creation, millions and billions miles away, and everywhere. That is the specific significance of His body. So this is described here. [sings:]
aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våtti-manti
paçyanti pänti kalayanti ciraà jaganti
änanda-cinmaya-sadujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
 [Bs 5.32]
[I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth, substantiality and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane.]
And another special significance of the parts of His body, limbs or hands or legs, eyes, ears... What is that significance? Now, each part of His body has got all the potency of other parts of the body. Just like with our eyes we can simply see; but the Lord, He can not only see by His eyes, transcendental eyes, but He can also hear, He can also eat. All the... All the functions of all other parts of the body, He can function by any part of His body. Not that a particular part of the body can function only for a particular purpose. No. 
Just like simply by glancing... In the Vedic literature it is said, sa aikñata sa asåjata: "Simply by seeing—simply by seeing—He impregnated all the energies for creation. Simply by seeing." Mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram [Bg 9.10]. 
[This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunté, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.]
Simply by His glance. Simply by His glance He impregnates the material energy for functioning. It is going on.
So He has got all the potencies in all the parts of His body. Aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våtti-manti paçyanti pänti kalayanti. That is the difference between His body and our body. So when there is description in the Vedas that "He has no leg, no hand, no eyes," that does not mean He has no eyes. He has got eyes, but not these eyes just like we have got conception. So here it is explained that aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våtti-manti. His parts of the body are invested with all the potencies of other parts of the body. With any part of His body He can function any work.
[sings Brahma-saàhitä, verses 32–35, 37, 38]

aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våtti-manti

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti [Bs 5.38]. Now, people say that "Whether God can be seen? If anyone has seen God?" Yes, God can be seen. There is no doubt about it. But it requires some qualification. Not some, but only one qualification. God is so kind that He does not require any material qualification. He does not require that you should be very learned man, very beautiful, or very rich man, or a king or emperor or minister or president, no, nothing of the sort. You can be anything. But only one qualification required. Then you can see God. What is that qualification? 
[sings:] Premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti. That qualification is unalloyed love. That's all. 
One who has achieved that unalloyed..., unalloyed love for God... Unalloyed love means without any tinge of philosophical speculation or fruitive activities. That's another subject; it requires great explanation. But unalloyed love means without any tinge of material color. That is called unalloyed. Even philosophical speculation or fruitive activities, even if it is offered to the Supreme Lord, that is not love. Love is above this. So if one can achieve that unalloyed love for God, with that, I mean to say, magic wand, the eyes become eligible for seeing God. Premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena. And that, that eye, is called devotional eye. Devotional. 
We have to... Not only eyes, but every part of our body, we have to spiritualize by the contact. By the contact of spiritual service in devotion of the Lord, we can gradually spiritualize our whole set of senses. Just like a iron rod given to the fire: gradually the temperature rises. It becomes warm, warmer, warmest, very hot, then red hot. When it is red hot, then it is no longer iron; it is fire. Similarly, by our contact in devotional service of the Lord we can change the whole position of our material existence. And we have... If we have developed to that stage of unalloyed love for God, then God can be seen twenty-four hours, not that once seen and again not seen. No. 
This is described here, that santaù, the great devotees, unalloyed devotees, who are liberated souls, have no connection with material activities or philosophical speculation, such unalloyed devotees, because their eyes are smeared with the ointment of love only, therefore they can see the Lord sadaiva, always, twenty-four hour.

Balance Engineer: 		Ken Scott
Orchestral arrangements on Govinda: 	John Barham
All titles traditionally arranged:  	Mukunda Goswami

Rädhä Kåñëa Temple, London
Originally Recorded at 
Apple Studios in London, 
England, 1970

In 1966 Çréla Prabhupada with a handful of followers, registered the International Society for Kåñëa Consciousness at his humble storefront temple in New Yorks's lower east side, By 1969 the Hare Kåñëa Mantra had spread throughout the West, and with help of George Harrison and the Beatles, the recording of the mantra on this album reached the top ten in record charts throughout the world. The Hare Kåñëa devotees were featured three times on the BBC show, "Top of the Tops", and the lead song "Govinda" also appeared on the charts at the same time. The Hare Kåñëa chant had become a household word in Britain and in many other countries throughout the world.
George played harmonium and dubbed in lead and bass guitar on "The Hare Kåñëa Mantra" song, and the lead guitar opening on "Govinda". The devotees played all kinds of instruments: Tamala Kåñëa Goswami played the flute, Harivilasa played the oud, Jivananda and Lilavati sang on Çré Isopanisad and other songs and Yamuna sang on Govinda and Bhaja Hure Mana. The studio engineers and staff were very enthusiastic and everyone joined in spontaneously for the chorus of "The Hare Kåñëa Mantra". This recording is a milestone in the history of the Kåñëa consciousness movement in the West.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Pralaya-payodhi-jale-dhåtavän asi vedam, vihita-vahitra-caritram akhedam. Today is the incarnation day of Lord Kåñëa's appearing as the Boar. He lifted the world when it was submerged within the water of Garbhodakça, Garbhodaka Ocean. The universe which we are seeing, it is only half. The other half is filled with water, and in that water is Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu lying. 
So one demon, Hiraëyäkña, he pushed this earthly planet within that water, and Lord Kåñëa delivered this earthly planet from water in the shape of a boar. So that auspicious day is today, Varäha-dvadaçé. This is called Varäha-dvadasi. So on this day it is better to sing, to glorify the different incarnations of Lord within this universe. The first incarnation is the fish form.
So these prayers were offered by Jayadeva Gosvämé. One Vaiñëava poet advented about seven hundred years before Lord Caitanya’s appearance. He was a great devotee, and his specific poetry, Géta-govinda, is very famous all over the world. Géta-govinda. Géta-govinda is the subject matter of Kåñëa playing on flute about Rädhäräëé. That is the subject matter of Géta-govinda. 
The same poet, Jayadeva Gosvämé, has offered this prayer, pralaya-payodhi-jale-dhåtavän asi vedam. He says, “My dear Lord, when there was devastation within this universe, everything was filled with water. At that time You saved the Vedas stacked in a boat, and You held the boat from being drowned in the water, in the shape of a big fish.” This fish first of all was caught in the waterpot just like a small fish. Then it enlarged, and the fish was kept in a bigger water reservoir. In this way, the fish was increasing. Then the fish informed that “Devastation is coming. You just save all the Vedas on a boat, and I shall protect it.” Jayadeva Gosvämé is offering prayer, “My Lord, You saved the Vedas when there was devastation in the shape of fish.”
The next is Kürmävatära. There was churning of the ocean. One side all the demigods and one side all the demons, and the churning rod was a great hill called Mandara-pärvata. And the resting place was on the back of the Lord appeared as a tortoise. So he’s offering his prayer that “You appeared as a tortoise just to become the resting place. And this happened because You were feeling some itching sensation on Your back. So You accepted this big rod, Mandara Hill, to itch, as the itching instrument.”
Then the next incarnation is this Varäha, boar or hog. He delivered this earthly planet by the tusk, and He kept the whole world on His tusk. We can just imagine how big He appeared. And the world at that time appeared just like the moon disc with some marks on it. So keçava dhåta-varäha-çaréra. He says, “My dear Lord, You have appeared as the great boar. So let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.”
Fourth incarnation is Nåsiàhadeva. Nåsiàhadeva appeared to save Prahläda Mahäräja, who was five-years-old boy and he was being tortured by his atheistic father. So He appeared from the pillar of the palace as a half-man, half-lion. Because this Hiraëyakaçipu took benediction from Brahmä that he’ll not be killed by any man or any animal. So the Lord appeared neither man nor animal. This is the difference between the Lord’s intelligence and our intelligence. We are thinking that we can cheat the Lord by our intelligence, but the Lord is more intelligent than us. This Hiraëyakaçipu wanted to cheat Brahmä by indirect definition. First of all he wanted to become immortal. Brahmä said, “That is not possible because even I am not immortal. Nobody in this material world is immortal. That is not possible.” So Hiraëyakaçipu, the demon... The demons are very intelligent. He thought that “Round about way I shall become immortal.” He prayed to Brahmä that “Please give me the benediction that I shall not be killed by any man or any animal.” Brahmä said, “Yes, that is all right.” “I shall not be killed in the sky, on the water or on land.” Brahmä said, “Oh, all right.” “I shall not be killed by any man-made weapons.” “That’s all right.” 
In this way, he utilized his intelligence in so many ways just to come to the conclusion of being immortal. But the Lord is so cunning that He kept intact all the benediction given by Brahmä, still he was killed. He said that “I’ll not be killed either during daytime or night.” Brahmä said “Yes.” So he was killed just in the evening, just in the junction of day and night. You cannot say it is day or night. He took the benediction that “I shall not be killed in the sky, on the water, on the land.” So he was killed on His lap. He took the benediction that “I shall not be killed by any man-made or any God-made weapons.” That was given, “All right.” So he was killed by the nails. 
In this way, all the benedictions were kept intact, still he was killed. Similarly, we may make plan, we may make very advancement in scientific knowledge, but the killing process of nature will be there. Nobody can escape. By our intelligence we cannot escape. The four principles of material existence means birth, death, old age and disease. We can manufacture many medicines, many weapons, many means, many methods, but you cannot escape these four principles of material existence, however great you may be. That was proved by Hiraëyakaçipu. Hiraëyakaçipu was one of the stalwart materialistic and he wanted to live forever, enjoy, but he also could not live. Everything was finished.
Then next incarnation is Vämana, the dwarf. Lord Vämana appeared before Bali Mahäräja. That was also another cheating. Bali Mahäräja conquered all the universal planets, and the demigods were too much disturbed. So Vämana Mahäräja... Vämanadeva went to Bali Mahäräja that “You give me some alms. I am brähmaëa. I have come to beg from you.” So Bali Mahäräja said, “Yes. I’ll give You.” So He wanted three feet land only. So by one feet the whole universe was covered, upside, and another feet the other half was covered. Then the third feet Bali Mahäräja said, “Yes, now there is no place. Please keep Your feet on my head. Still my head is there.” So Vämanadeva was very much pleased by the sacrifice of Bali Mahäräja. He gave up everything for the Lord. So he is one of the great authorities. Out of the twelve authorities, Bali Mahäräja is one of the authorities because he sacrificed everything to satisfy the Lord.
Next is Paraçuräma. Paraçuräma, twenty-one times He made a massacre propaganda for killing all the kñatriya kings. The kñatriya kings were very much dishonest at that time, so he killed them for twenty-one times. They fled from here and there. And from the history of Mahäbhärata it is understood, at that time some of the kñatriyas fled and took shelter in the European side. And the Indo-European stock is from those kñatriyas. That is history, historical information from Mahäbhärata.
Then next incarnation is Lord Räma. So He fought with Rävaëa, who had ten heads. So... And the next incarnation is Balaräma. Balaräma is the elder brother of Kåñëa. He is incarnation of Saìkarñaëa, next expansion of Kåñëa. So He was very white in complexion, and He was wearing blue garments, and with His plow He was...sometimes He was angry with Yamunä River, and He tried to dry up the Yamunä River. That description is given here. And Yamunä, out of His fear, she agreed to the proposal of Balaräma.
And the next incarnation is Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha, He decried the Vedic principles. Therefore, He is calculated as atheist. Anyone who does not agree with the Vedic principles, he is considered as atheist. Just like one who does not believe in the Bible, they are called heathens; similarly, those who do not accept the Vedic principles, they are called atheists. So Lord Buddha, although incarnation of Kåñëa, He said that “I do not believe in Vedas.” What was the reason? The reason was to save the poor animals. 
At that time, people were sacrificing the poor animals under the plea of Vedic sacrifice. So demonic persons, they want to do something under the protection of authority. Just like a big lawyer takes the protection of the lawbook and he makes the law unlawful. Similarly, the demons are so intelligent that they take advantage of scriptural injunction and do all nonsense. So these things were going on. In the name of Vedic sacrifice, they were killing animals like anything. So Lord became very much compassionate to these poor animals and He appeared as Lord Buddha, and His philosophy was nonviolence. His philosophy was atheist because He said that, 
“There is no God. This combination of matter is a manifestation, and you dismantle the material elements, there will be void and there will be no sense of pleasure and pain. That is the nirväëa, ultimate goal of life.” That was His philosophy. But actually His mission was to stop animal killing, to stop the men from so much sinful activities. So Lord Buddha is also prayed herewith. So people will be surprised that Lord Buddha is designated as atheist and still the Vaiñëavas, they are offering their respectful prayers to Lord Viñëu [Buddha]. Why? Because the Vaiñëava knows how the God is acting for His different purposes. Others, they do not know.
The next avatär incarnation is Kalki. That is yet to take place. Kalki avatära will appear at the end of this age, Kali-yuga. The Age of Kali-yuga, duration of this age is still to be, I mean to say, fulfilled in 400,000’s of years. So at the end of Kali, that means at the last stage, after about 400,000’s of years, the incarnation of Kalki will appear. That is predicted in the Vedic literatures, as Lord Buddha’s appearance was also predicted in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. And Çrémad-Bhägavatam was compiled five thousand years ago, and Lord Buddha appeared about 2,500 years ago. 
Therefore, about Lord Buddha’s appearance it is predicted that at the beginning of Kali-yuga Lord Buddha will appear. There was prediction, and that has actually come to be true. Similarly, there is prediction about Kalki avatära, and that will also come to be true. So at that time, Lord Kalki’s business will be simply to kill. No instruction. Just like in Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa gave instruction in the shape of Bhagavad-gétä. But at the end of Kali-yuga, people will be so much degraded that there is no more possibility to give any instruction. They will not be able to understand even. 
At that time the only weapon will be to kill them. And one who is killed by the Lord, he also gets salvation. That is God’s all-merciful quality. Either He protects or He kills, the result is the same. So that will be the last stage of this Kali-yuga, and after that, again Satya-yuga, the age of religiosity, will begin. These are the statements of Vedic literature. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Pralaya-payodhi-jale dhåtavän asi vedam. This is a song sung by great Vaiñëava poet Jayadeva Gosvämé. The purport is that when there was devastation, the whole universe was flooded with water. The ultimate dissolution of this material world will be, first of all, there will be no water, all water on the earth will be dried up by scorching heat of the sun. The sun will become twelve times stronger as it is at the present moment. In that way, evaporate all the waters, the seas and the oceans will be all evaporate. 
Therefore all living creatures on the Earth will die, and then, due to scorching heat, practically everything will be turned into ashes. Then there will be rain for a hundred years, torrents of rain, like the trunk of the elephant, and thus the whole universe will be filled with water. That is called pralaya-payodhi. At the time of devastation, pralaya, the whole universe will be just like it is now filled with air, at that time it will be filled up with water.
So at that time Vedas will be saved by the Lord on a boat, and the boat will be stuck up in the wings of the great fish. That great fish is the incarnation of Kåñëa. Therefore he is worshiping, keçava dhåta-ména-çaréra jaya jagadéça. So ména-çaréra. The next is kñitir iha vipulatare tiñöhati tava påñöhe dharaëi-dharaëa-kiëa-cakra-gariñöhe. So there will be churning, next incarnation is tortoise. On the back of the tortoise the meru-parvata will be fixed up, or the world will rest on the back of the tortoise. This is second incarnation. First fish, and then tortoise.
Then varäha-avatära. One demon, Hiraëya, Hiraëyakaçipu and Hiraëyäkña. So he'll, by his demonic activities will throw the Earth on the Garbho Sea. There is a sea within this universe. Half of the globe is filled up with Garbhosamudra, on which Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is there, and from Him a lotus stem comes out wherein Brahmä takes birth. So all the planets are hanging as different stems of this original stem coming out from the abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. So one demon of the name Hiraëyäkña, he will put this Earth within this water, and at that time, the Lord will come out in the incarnation of Varäha. The Varäha incarnation came as a small insect from the nose of Brahmä, and when he put it on his hand, He began to increase. In this way He assumed a very gigantic body, and with His tusk, He picked up the Earth from within the water of Garbho ocean. That is called keçava-dhåta-varäha-rüpa.
The next is tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-såìgaà dalita-hiraëyakaçipu-tanu-bhåìgam. Hiraëyakaçipu, he was another demon who wanted to be immortal. So he took benediction from Brahmä that he'll not die on land, in the sky or in the water. So, in order to keep as it is, the benediction given by Brahmä, Lord Kåñëa tries to honor the words of His devotee. So Brahmä gave him benediction, "Yes, you will not die on land, on water, in sky.'' But Nåsiàhadeva appeared as half-lion, half-man, because Hiraëyakaçipu also took benediction from Brahmä that he'll not be killed by any man or any animal. 
So He assumed the form of something which you cannot say a man or animal, and He put the demon on His lap, which is neither land, water or sky. And he wanted to, not to be killed by any weapons. Therefore the Lord killed Him with His nails. Nail is not considered as weapon. In this way, he wanted to cheat Brahmä, but the Lord is so intelligent that He cheated Hiraëyakaçipu, and killed him. Keçava dhåta-narahari-rüpa. Dalita-hiraëyakaçipu-tanu-bhåìgam. Just like with our nails, we can kill any insect. Take an ant, you can bifurcate it. Similarly, Hiraëyakaçipu was such a giant demon, he was compared just like a little insect, and was killed by the nails of the Lord.
Then, next incarnation is Vämanadeva. This Vämanadeva, a dwarf, He went to Bali Mahäräja and asked him three feet land, and his guru, Çukräcärya, induced him not to promise, because He is Viñëu. But Bali Mahäräja was very much satisfied to offer something to Viñëu, he gave up the connection of his guru, because he forbade him to serve Viñëu. Therefore Bali Mahäräja is one of the mahäjanas. Nobody can check the worship of Viñëu. 
If anyone checks, he may be guru, he may be father, he may be relative, he should be rejected, immediately. Therefore Bali Mahäräja is a mahäjana. He showed this example: because his guru put hindrances on the path of his worshiping Lord Viñëu, he gave up the connection of his guru. So by this process he begged, but that was not begging, practically that was cheating. But Bali Mahäräja agreed to be cheated by the Lord. That is the symptom of the devotee. The devotee agrees to any action of the Lord, and Bali Mahäräja saw that the Lord wanted to be cheat. 
By asking three feet land, He'll take the whole universe, so he agreed. And by two feet the whole universe was covered up and down. Then Vämanadeva asked him that where is to keep the third feet? So Bali Mahäräja agreed, "My Lord, you keep it on my head, I have got my body still.'' In this way he purchased Lord Viñëu, Vämanadeva, and Vämanadeva remained as the doorkeeper of Bali Mahäräja. So by giving everything, sarvätma snapane bali, he gave everything to Lord, and by that giving up, he purchased the Lord. He remained voluntarily as doorkeeper of Bali Mahäräja. 
So, chalayasi vikramaëe balim adbhuta-vämana pada-nakha-néra-janita-jana-pävana, when Vämanadeva expanded His leg upwards, by His toe there was a hole in the covering of the universe, and through that hole the Ganges water came from Vaikuëöha. Pada-nakha-néra-janita, and that Ganges water is flowing now in the universe sanctifying everywhere, wherever the Ganges water is there. Pada-nakha-néra-janita-jana-pävana.
Then next incarnation is Bhågupati, Paraçuräma. Paraçuräma is a çaktyaveña avatära. So He, twenty-one times, killed the kñatriyas. So out of Paraçuräma's fear, all the kñatriyas, they migrated towards Europe, it is said in the history, Mahäbhärata. So twenty-one times he attacked all the kñatriyas. They were not in order, so He killed them, and there is a big tank in Kurukñetra where all the bloods were reserved. Later on it became water. So kñatriya-rudhira, in order to pacify the aggrieved Earth, He soaked the earth with the blood of the kñatriyas, snapayasi payasi ñamita-bhava-täpam. Vitarasi dikñu raëe dik-pati-kamanéyaà daça-mukha-mauli-balim ramaëéyam. 
Then next avatära is Rämacandra. So the Rävaëa, who had ten heads, he challenged the Lord, and Lord Rämacandra took up the challenge and killed him. Then vahasi vapuñi viçade vasanaà jaladäbhaà hala-hati-bhéti-milita-yamunäbham. When Baladeva wanted Yamunä to come near Him, so she was not coming. Therefore with His plow He wanted to bifurcate the earth, and at that time Yamunä submitted, and she came near to the Lord. Hala-hati-bhéti-yamunä, hala-hati-bhéti-milita-yamunäbham, Yamunä was punished by Lord Baladeva. Keçava dhåta-haladhara-rüpa, hala, haladhara means plow, haladhara-rüpa jaya jagadéça hare.
Next, Buddha, Lord Buddha. Nindasi yajïa-vidher ahaha çruti-jätam. Lord Buddha defied the Vedic injunction, because His mission was to stop animal-killing, and in the Vedas, in some of the sacrifices, animal-killing is prescribed. So those who are so-called followers of the Vedic rules, they wanted to stop Buddhadeva in His mission for stopping animal-killing, so therefore when people wanted to give evidence from the Vedas, that in the Vedas there is description, there is sanction of animal-killing in sacrifices, why you are stopping? He, nindasi, He defied. And because He defied the authority of Vedas, therefore Buddha philosophy was not accepted in India. Nästika, anyone who will deny the authority of the Veda, he'll be called a nästika, non-believer. Vedas cannot be disrespect. So in this way, Lord Buddha, to save the poor animals, He sometimes defied the injunction of the Veda. Keçava dhåta buddha-çaréra jaya jagadéça.
The next avatära is Kalki avatära. We are awaiting, after four hundred thousands of years from this time, the Kalki avatära will come, and He'll take a sword on the horseback, just like a king, He'll simply go on killing all these non-believers, Godless creatures. There will be no more preaching. As in other incarnation there is preaching, in Kalki avatära the population of the whole world will be so much reduced to animalism that there will be no more power to understand what is God, or what is spiritualism. And it is already there, the Kali-yuga. It will increase. People will have no power to understand this philosophy, God consciousness. So at that time there is no other alternative than to kill them all, and usher in another Satya-yuga. That is the way of [indistinct]. [end]

[I offer my obeisances to Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityänanda, Çré Advaita, Gadädhara, Çréväsa and all others in the line of devotion.]

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, His incarnation Çré Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Çré Gadädhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Çréväsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu are complete when we say, çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. As preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by chanting this Païca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Païca-tattva mantra, namely, 
çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda 
çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. 
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is known as mahä-vadänyävatära, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahä-mantra [Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare], we must first take shelter of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, learn the Païca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. That will be very effective.

[My dear Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord, kindly engage me in Your service. I am now embarrassed with this material service. Please engage me in Your service.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This is a prayer to Lord Caitanya. The devotee is saying, "O Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, kindly show me Your causeless mercy." Çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu doyä koro more. 
"Because You have come to deliver fallen souls, so You will not find the most fallen soul like me." This is the humble prayer. We should be conscious of our fallen condition and pray to the Lord in that way, that "My dear Lord, somehow or other I am fallen. Now kindly pick me up." 
The substance of this song is like this. Of course, the language, Sanskrit, you may understand..., you may not understand, but the vibration will act. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

saàsära-dävänala-léòha-loka-
träëäya käruëya-ghanäghanatvam
präptasya kalyäëa-guëärëavasya
vande guroù çré-caraëäravindam
This song is offering obeisances particularly to the spiritual master, and the symptoms of the spiritual master are described in this prayer. The spiritual master has two kinds of symptoms in his activities. One kind is called constant, and other kind is called temporary. 
So the first verse says that the constant symptom of the spiritual master is that he can deliver his disciple from the blazing fire of this material existence. That is the eternal qualification of spiritual master. 
[break] Träëäya käruëya-ghanäghanatvam. Träëäya means for deliverance; käruëya means compassionate, very merciful. The spiritual master comes to the deliverance of the fallen souls out of his causeless mercy. 
Nobody has any business for the sufferings of others. The best example is Lord Jesus Christ, that he suffered for others. And it is the principle, in the Bible, that he accepted all the sins of others. This is the sign of spiritual master, that he voluntarily accepts the sinful activities of others and delivers them. That is the qualification of spiritual master. 
How it is? Just like ghanäghanatvam. Ghanäghanatvam means dense cloud in the sky. The first example has been said that this material existence is just like forest blazing fire. Now, to extinguish the forest blazing fire, there is no use of sending fire brigade. The fire brigade cannot approach the forest fire; neither any man can go there to extinguish the fire. 
One has to depend completely on the mercy of nature. That means one has to completely depend on the clouds in the sky. Otherwise, there is no question of pouring water on that blazing fire. So the example is very appropriate. As man-made engine or fire brigade is unable to extinguish the forest blazing fire; similarly, the material existentional blazing fire cannot be extinguished by any man-made method.
They are planning to be very comfortable in this material existence, but they are still more being confused and failure. That peace movement, that United Nation movement, everything is failure. Why? These miseries of this material existence cannot be stopped by any material means. One has to take the shelter of spiritual means. Just like the blazing fire in the forest has to wait for the cloud in the sky, similarly, one has to wait for the merciful cloud as the spiritual master. That is described. Träëäya käruëya-ghanäghanatvam, präptasya kalyäëa-guëärëavasya.
[The spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean of mercy. Just as a cloud pours water on a forest fire to extinguish it, so the spiritual master delivers the materially afflicted world by extinguishing the blazing fire of material existence. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.]
So the spiritual master is not self-made. It is not that if anyone comes before you and bluffs you that "I have attained spiritual perfection, and I have realized something by some method.'' No. The spiritual master, bona fide spiritual, means he has to receive the power from authority. Otherwise it is useless. No. It is not that one can become spiritual master overnight. He has to take the power from his spiritual master. Therefore it is called präptasya. Präptasya means one who has obtained, one who has got the merciful blessings of his spiritual master.
We should always remember that the spiritual master is in the disciplic succession. The original spiritual master is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He blesses His next disciple, just like Brahmä. Brahmä blesses his next disciple, just like Närada. Närada blesses his next disciple, just like Vyäsa. Vyäsa blesses his next disciple, Mädhväcärya. Similarly, the blessing is coming. Just like royal succession—the throne is inherited by disciplic or hereditary succession—similarly, this power from the Supreme Personality of Godhead has to receive. 
Nobody can preach, nobody can become a spiritual master, without obtaining power from the right source. Therefore the very word, it is stated here, präptasya. Präptasya means "one who has obtained." Präptasya kalyäëa. What he has obtained? Kalyäëa. Kalyäëa means auspicity. He has received something which is auspicious for all the humankind. Präptasya kalyäëa-guëärëavasya. 
Here is another example: guëärnava. Arëava means ocean, and guëa means spiritual qualities. Just like the same example is going on. It is very nice poetry. There is nice rhetorics and metaphor. The example is set, blazing fire, and it is to be extinguished with the cloud. And wherefrom the cloud comes? 
Similarly, wherefrom the spiritual master receives the mercy? The cloud receives his potency from the ocean. Therefore the spiritual master also receives his power from the ocean of spiritual qualities, that is, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
So präptasya kalyäëa-guëärëavasya. Such kind of spiritual master one has to accept, and vande guroù çré-caraëäravindam, and one has to offer his respectful obeisances to such authorized spiritual master. [end]

"Extinguishing the Blazing Fire of Material Existence"

He says, "One who, with great care and attention, loudly recites this beautiful prayer to the spiritual master during the brähma-muhürta obtains direct service to Kåñëa, the Lord of Våndävana, at the time of his death."

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by His plenary expansion Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, His incarnation Çré Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Çré Gadädhara Prabhu, and His marginal potency Çréväsa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is always accompanied by these other tattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu are complete when we say, çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. As preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by chanting this Païca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Païca-tattva mantra, namely, çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is known as mahä-vadänyävatära, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahä-mantra (Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare), we must first take shelter of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, learn the Païca-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. That will be very effective.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu doyä koro more, tomä binä ke doyälu jagata-mäyäre. This is a song composed by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. He is praying Lord Caitanya that “My dear Lord, please be merciful upon me because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?’’ Actually, this is the fact. Not only Narottama däsa Öhäkura, but also Rüpa Gosvämé, he also prayed for Lord Caitanya when both of them met at Prayäga, Allahabad, in the first meeting of Lord Caitanya and Rüpa Gosvämé at Prayäga. 
At that time, Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé also said, “My dear Lord, You are the most munificent of all incarnations because You are distributing love of Kåñëa, Kåñëa consciousness.’’ In other words, when Kåñëa was personally present, He simply asked us to surrender but He did not distribute Himself so easily. He made condition that “First of all you surrender.’’ But here, in this incarnation, Lord Caitanya, although He’s Kåñëa Himself, He makes no condition. He simply distributes, “Take love of Kåñëa.’’ 
Therefore, Lord Caitanya is approved as the most munificent incarnation, and Narottama däsa Öhäkura says that “Please be merciful upon me. You are so magnanimous because You have seen the fallen souls of this age, and You are very much compassionate upon them. But you should know also that I am the most fallen. Nobody is greater fallen than me.’’ Patita-pävana-hetu tava avatära. “Your incarnation is just to reclaim the conditioned souls, fallen souls. But I assure You that You will not find a greater fallen than me. Therefore, my claim is first.”
Then he prays to Lord Nityänanda. He says, hä hä prabhu nityänanda, premänanda sukhé. “My dear Lord Nityänanda, You are always joyful, in spiritual bliss, and You appear always very happy. So I have come to You because I am most unhappy. So if You kindly put Your glance over me, then I may also become happy.”
Then he prays to Advaita Prabhu: prabhu sétä-pati advaita gosäi. Advaita Prabhu’s wife’s name was Sétä. Therefore He is sometimes addressed as sétä-pati. So “My dear Advaita Prabhu, the husband of Sétä, please You also be kind upon me because if You become kind upon me, then naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda also will be kind upon me.” The reason is that actually, Advaita Prabhu invited Lord Caitanya to come down. 
When Advaita Prabhu saw the fallen souls, they are all engaged simply in sense gratificatory processes without understanding Kåñëa consciousness, He felt very much compassionate upon the fallen souls, and He also felt Himself as incapable of claiming all these fallen souls. He therefore prayed to Lord Kåñëa that “You come Yourself. Without Your personal presence, it is not possible to deliver these fallen souls.” So by His invitation Lord Caitanya appeared. “Naturally...” Narottama däsa Öhäkura prays Advaita Prabhu that “If You be kind upon me, naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda also will be kind upon me.”
Then he prays to the Gosvämés. Hä hä svarüpa, sanätana, rüpa, raghunätha. “My dear Gosvämé Prabhus,’’ svarüpa. Svarüpa Dämodara was personal secretary of Lord Caitanya. He was always keeping with Caitanya Mahäprabhu, and whatever He wanted, he immediately arranged for that. Two personal attendants, Svarüpa Dämodara and Govinda, they were always constantly with Lord Caitanya. So Narottama däsa Öhäkura also praying Svarüpa Dämodara. And then the Gosvämés. 
The next disciples of Lord Caitanya were the Six Gosvämés: Çré Rüpa, Çré Sanätana, Çré Bhaööa Raghunätha, Çré Gopäla Bhaööa Gosvämé, Jéva Gosvämé, and Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé. These Six Gosvämés were directly instructed by Lord Caitanya for spreading this movement of Kåñëa consciousness. Narottama däsa Öhäkura is praying also their mercy. And after the Six Gosvämés, the next äcärya was Çréniväsa Äcärya. So he’s also praying Çréniväsa Äcärya.
Actually, Narottama däsa Öhäkura was in the disciplic succession after Çréniväsa Äcärya. Or almost he was contemporary. And his personal friend was Rämacandra, Rämacandra Cakravarté. So he is praying that “I always desire the company of Rämacandra.” Devotee’s company. The whole process is that we should always be praying mercy of the superior äcäryas, and we should keep company with pure devotee. Then it will be easier for us to advance in Kåñëa consciousness, to receive the mercy of Lord Caitanya and Lord Kåñëa. This is the sum and substance of this song sung by Narottama däsa Öhäkura.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Gäy gauracand madhu sware. This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. He says that Lord Caitanya, Gaura, Gaura means Lord Caitanya, Gaurasundara, the fair complexion. Gäy gauracand madhur sware. In sweet voice, He is singing mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.
In very sweet song He's singing, and it is our duty to follow His footsteps to sing the mahä-mantra. So Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura advises, gåhe thäko, vane thäko, sadä 'hari' bole' òäko. Gåhe thäko means either you stay at your home as a householder, or you stay in the forest as the renounced order of life, it does not make difference, but you have to chant the mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa. 
Gåhe vane thäko, sadä 'hari' bole' òäko. Always chant this mahä-mantra. Sukhe duùkhe bhulo nä'ko, "Do not forget chanting either in distress or in happiness." Vadane hari-näma koro re. So far chanting, there cannot be any check, because in whatever condition I may be, I can go on chanting this mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.
So Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura advises, "Never mind, you are in distress or happiness, but go on chanting this mahä-mantra." Mäyä-jäle baddha ho'ye, ächo miche käja lo'ye. You are entrapped by the network of illusory energy, mäyä-jäle baddha ho'ye, just like the fisherman catches from the sea all kinds of creatures within the network. Similarly we are also within the net of illusory energy, and because we have no freedom, therefore all our activities are useless. Action in freedom has got some meaning, but when we are not free within the clutches of mäya, within the network of mäyä, then our so-called freedom has no value. 
Therefore, whatever we are doing is simply defeat. Without knowing our constitutional position, if you are forced to do something by the pressure of the illusory energy, it is simply useless waste of time. Therefore, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, "Now you have got full consciousness in the human form of life. So just chant Hare Kåñëa, Rädhä-Mädhava, all these names. There is no loss but great profit." Jévana hoilo çeña, nä bhajile håñékeça. Now gradually everyone is on the verge of death, nobody can say that, "I shall remain, I shall stay for more hundred years." No, any moment we can die. 
Therefore, he advises jévana hoilo çeña: "Our life is at end at any moment, and we could not serve Håñékeça, Kåñëa. Bhaktivinodopadeça." Therefore Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura advises, ekbär näm-rase mäto re: "Please be enchanted, näm-rase, in the mellow of chanting the transcendental name. Dive yourself within this ocean. That is my request."

They are just like the ocean of love of God, and they are popular both with the gentle and with the ruffians, because they are not envious of anyone.

As such, they are very expert in increasing the limits of the ocean of transcendental bliss, and they are the saviors of the living entities from the devouring mouth of liberation.]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu instructed His disciples to write books on the science of Kåñëa consciousness, a task which those who follow Him have continued to carry out down to the present day. The elaborations and exposition on the philosophy taught by Lord Caitanya are in fact the most voluminous, exacting, and consistent, due to the unbreakable system of disciplic succession of any religious culture in the world. Yet Lord Caitanya in His youth, widely renowned as a scholar Himself, left us only eight verses called Çikñäñöaka.
Glory to the çré-kåñëa-saìkértana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years together. Thus the fire of conditioned life, of repeated birth and death, is extinguished.
Second verse. Oh my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction upon the living beings, and therefore You have hundreds and millions of names like Kåñëa, Govinda, etc. In these transcendental names You have invested all Your transcendental energies, and there is no hard and fast rule for chanting these holy names. Oh my Lord, You have so kindly made approach to You easy by Your holy names, but unfortunate as I am, I have no attraction for them.
Three. One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street, more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind, one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly. [end]

This saìkértana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.]
Lord Caitanya gave us eight stanzas of His mission, what He wanted to do. They are explained in eight stanzas, and they are known as Çikñäñöaka. Çikñä means instruction, and äñöaka means eight. So in eight stanzas He has finished His instruction, and His next disciples, the Six Gosvämés, have explained them in volumes of books. So Lord Caitanya says the subject is paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saëkértanam: all glories to the chanting of Hare Kåñëa mantra or Kåñëa saëkértan movement. All glories. All victory. How it is victory, all victory? 
That He explains, that ceto-darpaëa-märjanam. If you chant this Hare Kåñëa mantra, then the dirty things which have accumulated in your heart due to material contamination will be cleared off. He gives the example that the heart is just like a mirror. If on the mirror there are heaps of dust accumulated, then one cannot see the real face by the reflection of the mirror. Therefore, it should be cleansed. So in our present conditional life, our heart is overloaded with so much dust accumulated due to our material association from time immemorial. So if we chant this Hare Kåñëa mantra, then the dust will be removed. Even not immediately, it will begin to be removed. And as soon as the mirror of the heart is cleansed of all dust, immediately one can see the face what he is. That face means real identification. By chanting Hare Kåñëa mantra, one will understand that he is not this body. This is our misconception. The dust means this misconception, accepting this body or the mind as self. Actually, we are not this body or the mind. We are spirit soul. So as soon as we can understand that we are not these bodies, immediately bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam. The blazing fire of material conditions, or the blazing fire of material miseries, immediately becomes dissipated. No more misery. Ahaà brahmäsmi. 
As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä. Immediately one understands his real identification as spirit soul, he becomes joyful. We are not joyful. Due to our material contact, we are always full of anxieties. By chanting Hare Kåñëa mantra, we shall immediately come to the stage of joyful life. Bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam. And this is called liberation. When one becomes joyful, free from all anxieties, that stage is actual liberation because every living creature, the spirit soul is by nature joyful. The whole struggle for existence is that he is searching after that joyful stage of life, but he missing the point. Therefore, in every effort for joyful life we are being defeated. This constant defeat can be overcome immediately by chanting this Hare Kåñëa mantra. That is the effect of this transcendental vibration. And after liberation, after being joyful, the material joys decreases. Whatever joy you want to enjoy, that decreases. Take, for example, for eating. If we want to eat some nice foodstuff, after eating a few morsels of food we do not like to take any more. That means here in the material world, whatever joy we accept, it will decrease. But spiritual joy, Lord Caitanya says änandämbudhi-vardhanam, the spiritual joy is just like ocean. But here in the material world, we have got experience that ocean does not increase. Ocean remains within its limit. But the ocean of spiritual joyfulness increases. Änandämbudhi-vardhanam. Çreyaù-kairava-candrikä-vitaraëam. How it increases? He is giving the example like the moon, rising moon. As the waxing moon. As the moon from the day of new moon, new moon night, the first day it is just like a small curved line. But second day, third day it increases, gradually it increases. Similarly, the spiritual life, the spiritual joyful life increases like the moon rays day after day, day after day, till it reaches the full moon night, yes. So, 
ceto-darpaëa-märjanam bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam
çreyaù-kairava-candrikä-vitaraëam vidyä-vadhü-jévanam. 
And the life then becomes full of knowledge because spiritual life means eternal life, full of bliss and full of knowledge. So we increase our volumes of joy because proportionately we increase the volume of our knowledge. Çreyaù-kairava-candrikä-vitaraëaà vidyä-vadhü-jévanam, änandämbudhi-vardhanaà. It is just like a ocean, but still it increases. Änandämbudhi-vardhanaà, sarvätma-snapanaà. It is so nice that once situated in this state of life, one thinks that "I am fully satisfied." Sarvätma-snapanaà. Just like if one takes bath dipping into the water, he feels refreshed immediately. Similarly, this spiritual life increasing joys day after day makes one feeling that he is fully satisfied.

[My dear brother, I request that you just worship Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda with firm conviction and faith. If one wants to be Kåñëa conscious by this process, one has to give up his engagement in sense gratification. One simply has to chant, "Hare Kåñëa! Hari Hari!" without any motive.]

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

parama karuëa, pahuì dui jana,
nitäi-gauracandra
This is a song sung by Locana däsa Öhäkura. Almost a contemporary of Lord Caitanya. So in his appreciation of Lord Nityänanda and Lord Caitanya. He says that, “These two personalities are very merciful incarnation of God.” Parama karuëa—highest mercy. Pahuì dui jana, dui jana means—two personalities and Their names are Nitäi and Gaura. Nitäi-gauracandra. So They are the best of all incarnations. That is also admitted by Rüpa Gosvämé because Kåñëa when He came. He preached only that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead but He did not give Himself. He was not so much... But in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu He gave Kåñëa. That is therefore.., Caitanya Mahäprabhu addressed by Rüpa Gosvämé: namo mahä-vadänyäya [Madhya 19.53]. The most munificent of all incarnations, is giving Himself.
parama karuëa, pahuì dui jana,
nitäi-gauracandra
saba avatära—, sära çiromaëi,
kevala-änanda-kanda
[Çré Çré Gaura Nityänandera Dayä, 1]
And in this incarnation there is no miserable condition. He is delivering everyone simply in transcendental bliss, chanting and dancing. And giving prasädam. In other incarnation He had to take sword and this to kill to deliver the demon. In this avatära He is delivering all the demons simply by änanda—transcendental bliss. Kevala-änanda-kanda. Therefore Locana däsa Öhäkura advises: bhaja bhaja bhäi, caitanya-nitäi—you simply worship Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda. Sudåòha viçväsa kori—with firm faith and your life will be successful.
bhaja bhaja bhäi, caitanya-nitäi,
sudåòha viçväsa kori
[Çré Çré Gaura Nityänandera Dayä, 2]
With firm faith, “Oh I have taken shelter of Nityänanda and Caitanya Mahäprabhu my life is now successful.” And... But one thing you have to do: viñaya chäòiyä se rase majiyä, you have to take shelter of Nityänanda prabhu and Caitanya prabhu without any material desire. Then it will not be very good. Viñaya chäòiyä se rase mukhe bolo—and the means and the process is simply chanting Hare Kåñëa. That is.. To take shelter of Gaura-Nityänanda and chant Hare Krishna mantra your life is... That is so nice. Viñaya chäòiyä—don’t desire any material enjoyment. Viñaya chäòiyä se—simply chant Hare Kåñëa, take shelter. Mukhe bolo.
Dekha dekha bhäi, tri-bhuvane näi, now just compare Lord Nityänanda and Caitanya, these incarnations. You cannot have throughout the three worlds such merciful preacher or deliverer of the fallen souls.
dekha dekha bhäi, tri-bhuvane näi,
emona dayäla dätä
[Çré Çré Gaura Nityänandera Dayä, 3]
Not only merciful but the greatest dispenser of charity. Dekha dekha bhäi, tri-bhuvane näi, emona dayäla dätä. And He is so merciful, what to speak of human being. Even birds and bees who hear about His saìkértana movement, they also become melted. Paçu-päkhé jhure, päñäëa vidare—the hardest; hardest demon and the example is Jagäi and Mädhäi and many demons. They became melted simply by Caitanya Mahäprabhu’s mercy. Paçu-päkhé jhure, päñäëa vidare çuni yära guëa-gäthä—simply by hearing the activities of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu or Nityänanda prabhu. So unfortunately I am so much absorbed in material sense gratification that I cannot remember Nityänanda prabhu and Caitanya Mahäprabhu. 
Viñaya bhuliyä... Viñaya majiyä, rohili bhuliyä—being engaged only in sense gratification I have forgotten Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Nityänanda. So why? If He is so munificent, He is so merciful, a still I cannot take the advantage of it. So Locana däsa Öhäkura laments on our behalf. Äpana karama, bhuïjäye çamana—I am so miss-doer, miscreant that I am forced to suffer the resultant action of my mischievous activities in the past. Äpana karama, bhuïjäye çamana—the Yamaräja sword is forcing me. Kohoye locana-däsa—this is the statement of Locana.

Parama koruëa, paìhü dui jana, nitäi gauracandra. This is a song by Locana däsa Öhäkura, a great devotee and äcärya of the Gauòéya-sampradäya. He is declaring that paìhü dui jana. Paìhü means lords. Dui jana means two. Who are the two Lords? Nitäi Gauracandra. One is Lord Nitäi, Nityänanda; another is Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. 
So he says that "These two Lords are very merciful.'' Parama karuëa, paìhü dui jana.. Parama karuëa means very merciful. Nitai Gauracandra. Saba avatära-sära- çiromaëi. Avatära means incarnation, and saba means all. "They are the essence of all incarnations.'' Saba avatära-sära-çiromaëi, kevala änanda-kanda: "And the specific significance of these incarnations is that to prosecute Their ways of self-realization is simply joyful,'' änanda-kanda. 
They introduced chanting and dancing. No other incarnation... There are many incarnation, just like Lord Räma. Even Kåñëa, He taught Bhagavad-gétä. That requires knowledge, understanding. But here Lord Caitanya, Nityänanda, introduced some process which is simply joyful: simply chant and dance. Kevala änanda-kanda. Saba avatära-sära- çiromaëi, kevala änanda-kanda.
Therefore he requests everyone, bhaja bhaja bhäi, caitanya nitäi: "My dear brothers, I request you. Just you worship Lord Caitanya and Nityänanda,'' sudåòha viçväsa kari’, "with firm conviction and faith.'' Don't think that this chanting and dancing will not lead you to the desired goal. It will, because there is assurance of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu that you will get all perfection by this process. 
Therefore Locana däsa Öhäkura says that "You must have firm faith and conviction.'' It will act. Bhaja bhaja bhäi, caitanya-nitäi, sudåòha. Sudåòha means firm; viçväsa kori’, with faith and conviction. But what is the process? The process is viñaya chäòiyä, se rase majiyä. If you want to be Kåñëa conscious under that process, then you have to give up your engagement of sense gratification. That is the only restriction. You cannot do that. Then it will be very nice. 
If you give up sense gratification and come to this stage, then it is sure that you will reach to the desired goal. Viñaya chäòiyä, se rase majiyä, mukhe bala hari hari: "And you have to simply chant Hare Kåñëa, 'Hari Hari,' that's all, without any motive of sense gratification.''
Dekha ore bhäi, tribhuvane näi. He says, "My dear brothers, you just try and examine that within these three worlds there is nobody like Lord Caitanya or Nityänanda Prabhu.'' Because, paçu-päkhé jhure, päñäëa vidare: "Their mercy and qualities are so great that even birds and beasts, they are crying, what to speak of human being?'' 
Actually, when Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu passed through the forest of Jhärikhaëòa, the tigers, the elephants, the snake, the deer, all joined Him in chanting Hare Kåñëa. It is so nice. Anyone can join. Animals can join, what to speak of human being? Of course, it is not possible for ordinary man to enthuse animals to chant, but Caitanya Mahäprabhu did it actually. 
So even if we cannot enthuse animals, we can enthuse at least human being to this path of Hare Kåñëa mantra chanting. Paçu-päkhé jhure, päñäëa vidare. And it is so nice that even the most stonehearted men will be melted. Päñäëa vidare. Päñäëa means stone, and vidare. Päñäëa, even stone, will melt, it is so nice. 
But he regrets that, viñaya majiyä: "Being entrapped by sense gratification...'' Viñaya majiyä, rohili bhuliyä. He's addressing himself, "My dear mind, you are entrapped in the sense gratification process and you have no attraction for chanting Hare Kåñëa.'' Viñaya bhuliyä, rahili majiyä, se pade nahila äça: "You have no attraction for the lotus feet of Caitanya-Nityänanda. So what can I say? It is only...'' 
Äpana karama, bhuïjäya çamana: "I can simply think of my misfortune only that Yamaräja, the superintendent of death, he is punishing me in this way, that he is not allowing me to be attracted to this movement.'' This is the statement of... Kahaye locana-däsa: "This is the statement of Locana däsa Öhäkura.'' [end]

Parama koruëa, pahü dui jana, nitäi gauracandra. This is a song sung by Locana däsa Öhäkura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, almost contemporary. He wrote one book, Caitanya-maìgala, depicting the activities of Lord Caitanya. That is a very famous book, Caitanya-maìgala. And he has composed many songs. 
Practically all Vaiñëavas, they are transcendentally poetic. That is one of the 26 qualifications of the Vaiñëava. So he says that “These two Lords,” nitäi gauracandra, “Lord Nityänanda and Lord Gauräìga, or Lord Caitanya, They are very merciful incarnations.’’ Saba avatära-sära çiromaëi. “They are essence of all incarnations.’’ The incarnation is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä that whenever there is discrepancies in the prosecution of religiosities and there is prominence of impious activities, at that time the Lord incarnates, or He descends on this material world, for protecting the pious and annihilating the impious. That is the mission of incarnation. 
Every incarnation we’ll find two things. Lord Kåñëa, He’s so beautiful, so kind, but He is very dangerous to the demons. The demons were seeing Him as thunderbolt, and the gopés were seeing Him as the most beautiful cupid. So in the Bhagavad-gétä also it is stated, ye yathä mäà prapadyante [Bg 4.11]. 
[All of them—as they surrender unto Me—I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Påthä.]
The God is realized in proportion to one’s freedom from the demoniac propensities. So in this age... Of course, the last incarnation, Kalki, He will simply kill. Long, long after, He will come. But here Lord Caitanya, His mission is no killing, simply favoring. That is the specific characteristic of Lord Caitanya. Because in this age, of course, there is very much prominence of irreligiosity. But if Lord Caitanya wanted to kill them, then there was no question of their salvation. They would be... 
Of course, anyone who is killed by incarnation he also gets salvation. But not to the spiritual planets, but they merge into the Brahman effulgence as the impersonalists desire. In other words, the impersonalist’s goal of salvation is as good as the goal of salvation of the enemies of God. That is not a very difficult job. So Lord Caitanya is merciful because He is embracing everyone by bestowing love of Kåñëa. 
Rüpa Gosvämé has described Lord Caitanya as the most munificent of all the incarnations because He is giving Kåñëa to everyone, without any qualification. So Locana däsa Öhäkura says that parama koruëa, pahü dui jana, nitäi gauracandra, that They are essence of all incarnation. Kevala änanda-kanda. And Their preaching process is very pleasing. Caitanya Mahäprabhu recommends “You chant Hare Kåñëa, dance nicely, and when you feel tired, just take rest and eat Kåñëa prasädam.” 
So His formula is very pleasing. Kevala änanda-kanda. While He was present in Jagannätha Puré, every day in the evening, dancing was...chanting and dancing continued. And after dancing is finished, He used to distribute sumptuously prasädam of Jagannätha. So many thousands of people used to assemble every night. So simply transcendentally pleasing, this movement. Kevala änanda-kanda.
Then he recommends, bhajo bhajo bhäi, caitanya nitäi. “My dear brother, just try to worship these two Lords, Caitanya and Nityänanda,” sudåòha viçväsa kori’, “with faith and conviction.” One should have faith in the words of Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya says that “Go on chanting. Simply by chanting, one will get all perfection of life.” So this is a fact. Unless we take to chanting, we cannot realize it; but those who are chanting, they are realizing that they’re getting all desired perfection of life very quickly. So we should chant this mantra with faith and conviction. But the only qualification required in this connection, he says, viñaya chäòiyä, se rase majiyä, mukhe bolo hari hari. We have to chant with faith and conviction; at the same time we should take care, we should be guarding against sense enjoyment. Viñaya chäòiyä, viñaya means sense enjoyment. And chäòiyä means give up. One should give up sense enjoyment. Of course, in this materialistic life we have got our senses and we are practiced to use them. We cannot stop it. But there is no question of stopping, but regulating it. Just like we want to eat. Viñaya means eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. So these things are not forbidden altogether, but they are adjusted just to make it favorable for executing my Kåñëa consciousness. So we should not take... Just like eating. We should not eat just to satisfy the taste. We should eat only just to keep ourself fit for executing Kåñëa consciousness. So eating is not stopped, but it is regulated favorably. Similarly, mating. Mating is also not stopped. But the regulative principle is that you should marry and you should have sex life only for begetting children Kåñëa conscious. Otherwise don’t do it. So everything is regulated. There is no question of stopping defense also. Arjuna was fighting, defending, under the order of Kåñëa. So everything is there. Nothing stop. Simply it is adjusted for executing our Kåñëa consciousness. Viñaya chäòiyä. We should not accept these viñaya, these four principles of bodily demands, namely eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, for sense gratification. No. The politicians, they fight for sense gratification. They do not see to the good of the people. For their political aggrandizement they fight. That fight is forbidden. But when fight is necessity for defending people, that fighting should be taken. So we have to give up this principle of sense gratification, or sense gratificatory process.
Dekho dekho bhäi tri-bhuvane näi. Then he says, “Just see, there is nobody else so merciful.’’ Paçu päkhé jhure, päñäëa vidare. By His mercy even the birds and beasts, they are also maintained. Actually, when Caitanya Mahäprabhu passed through the forest known as Jhärikhaëòa in central India, He was only accompanied by his personal attendant, and He was alone, and when He was passing through the forest He touched one tiger. He was sleeping, and the tiger answered roaring. The company, Caitanya Mahäprabhu’s attendant, he thought, “Now we are gone.’’ But actually, Caitanya Mahäprabhu asked the tiger, “Why you are sleeping? Just stand up. Chant Hare Kåñëa.’’ And the tiger began to dance. So actually, this happened. When Caitanya Mahäprabhu preached this Hare Kåñëa movement, the tigers, the deers, the... everyone joined. So, of course, we are not so powerful. But it is possible that at least we have seen the dogs are dancing in saìkértana. So it is possible also to take. But we may not attempt such great risk. But Caitanya Mahäprabhu could induce tigers to dance, we can at least induce every human being to dance. This is such a nice movement.
So paçu päkhé jhure, päñäëa vidare. Päñäëa means stone. So even the stone-hearted man also melts by chanting Hare Kåñëa. That we have experienced, seen. Päñäëa vidare, çuni’ jära guëa-gäthä. Simply by hearing the transcendental pastimes and characteristics of Lord Caitanya, even hard-hearted men, they also melted. There were many instances, Jagäi Mädhäi. Many fallen souls, they became elevated to the highest spiritual platform. Then Locana däsa Öhäkura says that viñaya majiyä, rohili bhuliyä. “Unfortunately, I am so much entrapped in these demands of the body or the senses that I have forgotten the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu.’’ Viñaya majiyä, rohili bhuliyä, se pade nahilo äça. “I could not desire to be attached to the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya.’’ So why it is so? So he’s lamenting that äpana karama, bhuïjäye çamana, that “I am suffering the sequence of my past misdeeds, that I could not be attracted by the Kåñëa consciousness movement. It is a punishment on me by the Yamaraja, the superintendent of death.’’ Actually, this Kåñëa consciousness movement, saìkértana movement, is so nice and attractive, every simple, I mean to say, unsophisticated person shall be attracted. But if one is not attracted, it is to be understood that he is being punished by the laws of the superintendent of death. Anyway, if we stick to this principle of chanting, then even Yamaräja, the superintendent of death, he’ll also fail to punish. That is the verdict of Brahma-saàhitä. Brahma-saàhitä says one who takes to this devotional life, his reaction of past deeds are adjusted immediately. So every one of us should take part in this movement of Kåñëa consciousness by chanting Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa Kåñëa Kåñëa Hare Hare, Hare Räma Hare Räma Räma Räma Hare Hare. [end]

The Mercy of Çré Çré Gaura and Nityänanda

Prabhupäda: ...pahü dui jana. Pahü means prabhu. The shortcut is pahü. Prabhu, lord, or master. So these prabhu, two, two prabhus, Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Nityänanda Prabhu. Caitanya Mahäprabhu is addressed as Mahäprabhu, Mahä-puruña. And others, they are addressed as prabhu. So these two prabhus, Nityänanda Prabhu and Caitanya Mahäprabhu, are very merciful, parama koruëa. Parama koruëa means extremely merciful. Extremely merciful because Kåñëa is also merciful, but because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original feature... Caitanya Mahäprabhu is also Kåñëa, but He is acting as devotee. He is not acting as Kåñëa. He is acting as devotee of Kåñëa.
namo mahä-vadänyäya
kåñëa-preme-pradäya te
kåñëäya kåñëa-caitanya-
nämne...
He is Kåñëa, but at present He has assumed the name of Kåñëa Caitanya.
Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya also appreciated Caitanya Mahäprabhu. He made one hundred verses about Caitanya Mahäprabhu, but Caitanya Mahäprabhu, just to teach us, He destroyed the çlokas: "Oh, it is too much praising Me." So anyway, some of the çlokas were saved. Two of them are mentioned in the Caitanya-caritämåta. So one of the çloka, verse, is,
vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yoga-
çikñärtham ekaù puruñaù puräëaù
çré-kåñëa-caitanya-çaréra-dhäré
kåpämbudhir yas tam ahaà prapadye
 [Cc Madhya 6.254]
Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya is offering his obeisances to Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu, speaking like this, that "You are the same original person, Kåñëa, but You have now assumed the form of Kåñëa Caitanya just to teach vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yogam. You have come to teach the mass of people the art of becoming detached to this material world.'' Vairägya-vidyä. Vairägya. Rägya means attachment, and viräga means detachment. 
So we fallen souls, conditioned souls, we are very much attached to this material body, and consequently, material world. This is the disease. This is called bhava-roga, or material disease, to become attached to this body. "I am Indian,'' "I am American,'' "I am white,'' "I am black''—I identify with this body because we are very much attached to this body. But if we study very deeply, "Why I am attached to this body?'' Suppose if there is some danger, immediately warning, just this roof is going to fall down, we shall immediately take care of our own body, not of our Godbrothers, because we are very much attached to this body. This is the first business, how to save this body. 
Now, the next question is "Why you are so much anxious to save this body?'' What will be the answer? Can anyone say? Why one is so much attached with this body? The answer is that because I, the real I, I am within this body, therefore I am anxious to save it. Then why you are anxious to save the soul, individual soul? The answer will be that because I am part and parcel of Kåñëa. So ultimately we want to love Kåñëa, but because we are in a forgetful platform, then someone is trying to save his body, someone is trying to save his bodily relationship. Therefore in so many ways we are implicated with this material atmosphere.
So Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu came to teach us how to become detached to this material. That is vairägya-vidyä. Vidyä means vairägya-vidyä. Vidyä does not mean to become more and more attached to this material world. That is not... That is avidyä, illusion, because I will not be able to save this body. This body will change. I will be annihilated. But still, I am very much anxious for this body. This is called illusion or ignorance or avidyä. So Caitanya Mahäprabhu came to teach us vairägya-vidyä, how to become detached. He personally showed by His life example that... He was very learned scholar in Navadvépa. His name was Nimäi Paëòita. And He was very influential also. He was so influential that simply by His calling, 100,000 people joined Him to show a civil disobedience movement, disobeying the order of the magistrate that "You cannot perform kértana." So Caitanya Mahäprabhu organized immediately about one lakh of people and went to perform at the house of the magistrate. The civil disobedience movement, perhaps you know that it was inaugurated by Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi, in India against the British government. But long, long before, five hundred years before, Caitanya Mahäprabhu, He started this civil disobedience movement against the order of Kazi. 
So He was so popular. My point is that not only He was a very learned scholar... He was young man, twenty, twenty-two years, but He was so popular that He could call 100,000 people at once to start this civil disobedience, His social position. He was beautiful, Gaurasundara. His another name is Gaurasundara, very beautiful body. And a very learned scholar, Nimäi Paëòita. Nobody could defeat Him. And very influential and born of a very high grade brähmaëa family. His father, His grandfather was very, very learned scholars. So in every way He was very well situated, although the brähmaëas are not very rich. They do not care for money. They are interested in knowledge, brahma-jïäna. And if one knows Brahman, then he is brähmaëa. Brahma jänätéti brähmaëaù: "Brähmaëa means one who knows the Absolute Truth." That is brahma-jïäna. The human life is meant for that purpose, athäto brahma jijïäsä. Everyone should be interested to enquire about Brahman, the Absolute Truth. At least, a class of man must be there in the society. That is the brain, brain of the society, brähmaëa. Just like you have got the brain in your body. If the brain is absent, if the brain is gone mad, then your whole body is useless. 
That is the position at the present moment. There is no brain in the society. All çüdras; no brähmaëas. Because nobody is interested with the Absolute Truth. Everyone is interested how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex and how to defend. That is going on, nationwide, worldwide. Therefore our Kåñëa consciousness movement is interested to make a section of the people brähmaëa, brain. They can guide. It is not that everyone requires; neither it is possible. Unless one is very intelligent, he cannot become brähmaëa. Brähmaëa means the most intellectual class of the society. That is brähmaëa. Satya çamaù damaù titikña ärjavaù, jïänaà vijïänam ästikyaà brahma-karma svabhäva-jam [Bg 18.42]. 
[Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brähmaëas work.]
These are the brähmaëa's qualification. He must be truthful—so much so truthful that even to his enemy he will not keep any secret. That is called truthfulness. And çamaù. Çamaù means controlling the senses. Damaù... Çamaù means controlling the mind. Mind is our enemy; mind is our friend. So if we can control the mind, the mind can act as very good friend. And if we do not control the mind, then he acts as enemy. Therefore the yoga system means controlling the mind, controlling the senses so they can act as my friend. Otherwise they will act as my enemies, käma krodha lobha moha.
So there is necessity of a class of men who will act as the brain of the society. That is called brähmaëa. That is real human society, where there are four classes of men: one acting as brain; one acting as arms or armies or protection; one acting as belly, or the food digesting machine... Unless you eat and digest food, how your body will be maintained? So everything is very scientifically designed in the Vedic civilization. So in the Kali-yuga there is scarcity of brähmaëa. Brähmaëa is vairägya. A brähmaëa is not interested with pounds, shilling, pence, "Get money and enjoy." That is not brähmaëa's business. What is enjoyment? That is illusion. You cannot enjoy, because you are conditioned by the stringent laws of nature, and where is enjoyment? There is no enjoyment. But they are thinking, "I am enjoying." This is called illusion, mäyä. There cannot be any enjoyment. When you are not free, when you are conditioned under the stringent laws of... You do not like to die; you are forced to die. You must die. You cannot say, "No, I will not die." No, that is not possible. So where is your freedom? But we are declaring, "Now we are independent." This is all illusion.
So Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared to save us from all these illusions. That is Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Caitanya means living, not dead. If we have no spiritual consciousness, if we have not Kåñëa's consciousness, then we are dead. This..., what is this body? This body is dead. Alive or dead, so-called dead, it is already dead because it is matter. But because there is spirit soul, it is moving. The same example: the motorcar, what is this? A lump of matter, some iron, some other metals or some rubbers, some combination. And so long the driver is there—it is moving—it is important so long it is moving. And as soon as the movement stops, you throw it away. That is very good experience in your country. So many useless motorcars are heaped together. So similarly, the brähmaëa means one must know that who is the driver of this body, brahma-jïäna. So at the present moment nobody knows who is driving this body. So therefore all çüdras, fourth-class men. There is no first-class man. But in the human society there must be four classes of men: first class, second class, third class... Fourth class also required for assisting the higher, third class. Everything is very nicely described in the Bhagavad-gétä, and Bhagavad-gétä was taught by Kåñëa Himself. But people could not follow Him, misunderstood Him. Therefore Kåñëa again came as Kåñëa Caitanya to teach personally the philosophy of Kåñëa.
Caitanya Mahäprabhu did not teach anything else than what was taught by Kåñëa. Therefore, Sarvabhauma Bhaööäcärya said, vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yogam çikñärtham, puräëah puruñaù. That Supreme Personality of Godhead... Vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yogaà çikñärtham ekaù puräëaù puruñaù çré-kåñëa-caitanya-çaréra-dhäré [Cc Madhya 6.254]: "Now You have assumed the form of Çré Kåñëa Caitanya, but You are Kåñëa.'' That is also Rüpa Gosvämé said. We have to follow the mahäjanas, great personality, authorities. Mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù [Cc Madhya 17.186]. 
[Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated self-realized person. Consequently, as the çästras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahäjanas advocate.]
We cannot manufacture a way of life. We have to follow the footprints of mahäjana, great personalities. That is the way. Here, at the present moment, everyone is speculating. What is the use of speculation? You are imperfect. Your senses are imperfect. Whatever you establish, because you have established by imperfect senses, they are all imperfect. Therefore they are suffering. There is no solution. So speculative method will not help us. 
So Caitanya Mahäprabhu's teaching is... It is not as He had manufactured something. He is also following. He quoted one verse from the prayers of Lord Brahmä:
jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta eva
san-mukharitäà bhavadéya-värtäm
sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhir
ye präyaço 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyäm
[SB 10.14.3]
[Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.]
This is a quotation from Çrémad-Bhägavatam in Brahma's prayer to Kåñëa. The purport is that you should give up this bad habit of speculation, jïäne prayäsam. Prayäsam means endeavor: "I shall get this knowledge by speculating." This is called jïäna-prayäsam, endeavoring uselessly for knowledge. So udapäsya: you give it up. Jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta. Just become submissive. Don't think yourself that you are very learned. Because if the senses are imperfect, how you can be learned? Whatever you see, that is imperfect. Just like we see every day the sun, these eyes. And what we see? It is just like a disc. Is it a disc? It is fourteen hundred times bigger than this earth. So what is the value of your seeing? You cannot see what is behind the wall. Still, you are proud of seeing—"Can you show me? Can you show me God?" And what power you have got to see? That he does not consider. He thinks, "I have got seeing power." Similarly, you study every sense—they are all imperfect, blunt. So any knowledge you acquire by gymnastic of the senses—useless. This is Caitanya Mahäprabhu's teaching. Not Caitanya Mahäprabhu's; it is the Bhägavata's teaching, and Caitanya Mahäprabhu's the same. So we have to give up this nonsense idea, that "I can attain to the perfect knowledge by speculation, manodharma, by speculation, manodharma, mental gymnastic." This will not help us.
So jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta eva. Just become submissive. And where to submit? You must submit to a perfect person. Otherwise why should you submit? Tad-vijïänärthaà sa gurum eva abhigacchet, samit-päëiù çrotriyaà brahma-niñöham [Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.2.12]. 
[To understand these things properly, one must humbly approach, with firewood in hand, a spiritual master who is learned in the Vedas and firmly devoted to the Absolute Truth.]
So Bhagavän Kåñëa also says,
tad viddhi praëipätena
paripraçnena sevayä
upadekñyanti tad jïänaà
jïäninaù tattva-darçinaù
 [Bg 4.34]
[Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.]
Tattva-darçé, one who has seen the things as it is, go there and from him take the knowledge, not that one who is speculating. This is the process, Vedic process. Therefore it is called çruti. Çravaëam. Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]. 
[Prahläda Mahäräja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viñëu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kåñëa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
Çravaëam means hearing; kértanam means glorifying. Of whom? About Viñëu, not for anything else. [indistinct] So Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu approved this process. When He was talking with Çré Rämänanda Räya, Rämänanda Räya suggested various methods of self-realization. So Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu did not reject them. He said, "Yes, it is also nice, but you go farther above. Go forward still." So in this way, when Rämänanda Räya quoted this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam, jïäne prayäsam udapäsya, He said... No, in the beginning He had, eho bähya, äge kaha [Cc Madhya 8.59]: "This process is not very important; it is external. If you know better than this, say." So in this way, after many rejection, when Rämänanda Räya came to this version, jïäne prayäsam udapäsya, Caitanya Mahäprabhu did not say that it is useless. Eho haya: "Yes, it is nice." Eho haya: "It can be accepted." That is the beginning, that don't try to speculate. Just become humble and meek and hear from the realized soul. Namanta. Jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta eva. Just become submissive. Do not think that you know by everything. That is your illusion, mäyä. Because you cannot know everything. You can..., you may know something. That is not possible that you know everything.
So to know everything perfectly you cannot do it simply by speculating or handling your senses, imperfect senses. San-mukharitäà bhavadéya-värtäm [SB 10.14.3]. 
[Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.]
You hear from the realized soul. So Kåñëa, hear from Kåñëa. That is... He is perfect. And sthäne sthitäù: to hear about Kåñëa, you do not require to change your position. Sthäne sthitäù. You are a medical man? That's all right. Remain medical man. You are scientist? That's all right. You are lawyer? That's all right. You are fool? That's all right. [laughter] Because everyone is fool, but they are divided by mental concoction that "Here is a fool; here is a learned.'' Because the learned is also a fool, but by mental concoction he is recognized as intelligent. Same mental concoction. Dvaite' bhadräbhadra sakali samana. Caitanya-caritämåta kaj said that "In the material world, 'This is good' and 'This is bad'—this is all mental speculation.'' Dvaite' bhadräbhadra sakali samana, ei bhäla, ei manda', saba manodharma: "That division, 'This is good; this is bad,' it is mental speculation.'' It has no value. It has no value. So this mental speculation will not help us. And therefore sthäne sthitäù: you remain in your position. It doesn't matter, good or bad. The mental speculator's verdict that "This is good; this is bad. This is intelligent; this is fool,'' they are all mental speculation. That will not help.
So you remain in your position. Either in good or bad, it doesn't matter. But you do one thing. Sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhiù. You use your ear. That ear is bestowed upon everyone, either fool or learned. So use that ear, sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhiù, and hear attentively, and mold your life as you hear from the realized soul. Sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-mano... One who remains like this, although he is imperfect fool, whatever he may be, he can conquer the ajita. Ajita means God. Nobody can conquer Him, but a devotee who sincerely hears about Him from the realized soul, he can conquer even Ajita, Kåñëa. Just like gopés. The gopés were women, and not very high class woman—cowherd's men, in the village, not in town. Very educated, high society, brähmaëa, kñatriya—no. They all belonged to vaiçya class. And they were woman, not Vedäntist, not scholar. But they conquered Kåñëa. Why? And that is the... They heard about Kåñëa, and they became lover of Kåñëa. That is required. So that is the real qualification. Caitanya Mahäprabhu, He was so strict about womanly association. Still, He recommended, ramyä käcid upäsanä vraja-vadhü-vargabhir yä kalpitä: "There is no better type of worshiping Kåñëa than the system which vraja-vadhü, the gopés, adopted to love Kåñëa. That is the first class.''
That is the recommendation of Vedic çästra. Sa vai puàsäà paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokñaje [SB 1.2.6]. 
[The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.]
First-class religion... Religion means to understand God. That is the sum and substance. The process may be different according to country, men. Just like we worship the Deity in the temple. This is also bhakti. And the Christians go to the church and offers prayer to God. That is also bhakti. That is also bhakti. Nine items of bhakti: çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam, arcanaà vandanaà däsyam [SB 7.5.23]. 
[Prahläda Mahäräja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viñëu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kåñëa through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.]
Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam, arcanam vandanam. Vandanam is offering prayer. So they go to the church or go to the mosque, they offer prayers to the Supreme. That is also bhakti. So there is no question of what type of religion you are following. That doesn't matter. You follow anything, whatever suits you. But the result should be judged. What should be the result? The result is how to love God. That should be the result. 
If you have come to that platform, how to love God, mad after God, as Caitanya Mahäprabhu is...
yugäyitaà nimeñeëa
cakñuñä prävåñäyitam
çünyäyitaà jagat sarvaà
govinda-viraheëa me
Govinda-viraheëa: "Being separated from Govinda, God, My life is vacant." This is required. It doesn't matter whether you follow Christianity or Hinduism or Muslimism. Whether you are feeling vacancy, everything vacant without Kåñëa, without God—that is the test. Yugäyitaà nimeñeëa. Every moment... Because one who is feeling separation from the Lord, he is feeling also, "When I shall see Him?" So this anxiety, Caitanya Mahäprabhu, yugäyitaà nimeñeëa: "A moment is seeming to Me a millenium, hundreds and millions of years' separation." That is love. If you love somebody and if you... Of course, in the material world, this love is not possible. There is no love in the material world. It is all lust. So love means loving God. That is love. So the Caitanya Mahäprabhu is teaching this. Yugäyitaà nimeñeëa cakñuñä prävåñäyitam: "I am feeling one moment as a millenium, being separated from Kåñëa. And the torrents of tears are coming just like torrents of rain.'' And çünyäyitaà jagat sarvam: "And the whole world is seeming to Me vacant,'' govinda-viraheëa me, "being separated from Govinda.'' This is love. So it doesn't matter what religious system you are following, but the result should be this, that you should be mad after God. That is the test. Sa vai puàsäà paro... That is first-class religion, yato bhaktir adhokñaje [SB 1.2.6], to love. Bhakti means love, service, rendering service. Adhokñaje. Adhokñaje means beyond the speculation of mind, mental exercise, bodily exercise. Adhokñaja. Adhakåta akñaja jïänam.
So Caitanya Mahäprabhu taught this. And He took sannyäsa. For the benefit of the whole world, He took sannyäsa. He gave up His very opulent position in Navadvépa, as I have told you, very learned scholar, very beautiful body, very beautiful wife, very affectionate mother, good popularity. There was no scarcity. And He was God Himself. Why there will be any scarcity? There is no question. But in spite of, He took sannyäsa for the benefit of the whole world. That Caitanya Mahäprabhu has come here in Atlanta. So you worship this Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Parama koruëa, pahü dui jana. They are very, very merciful, and little service will enhance your devotional service to a larger scale.
Thank you very much.

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

Çuddha-bhakata-caraëa-reëu, bhajana-anuküla. This is a song, sung by Bhaktivinode Öhäkura in pursuance of Prahläda Mahäräja’s instructions in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Prahläda Mahäräja has recommended, eh. Naiñäà matis tävad urukramäìghrim [SB 7.5.32] “one cannot have pure devotional attachment to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.” Naiñäà matis tävad urukramäìghrim, spåçaty anarthäpagamo yad-arthaù, “by touching the lotus feet of a pure devotee means immediately all misconceptions of life becomes eradicated.” 
Naiñäà matis tävad urukramäìghrim, spåçaty anarthäpagamo yad-arthaù, mahéyasäà päda-rajo-'bhiñekaà. Mahéyasäm, “those who are great souls, great devotees who accept the dust of their lotus feet.” Niñkiïcanänäà na våëéta yävat, “unless one comes to that point it is very different to advance in Kåñëa consciousness.” 
Actually it is not possible, one cannot make any advancement in Kåñëa consciousness unless he accepts the dust of the lotus feet of the pure devotees. So Bhaktivinode Öhäkura says that “the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotees is very favourable for advancement in Kåñëa consciousness.” 
Çuddha-bhakata-caraëa-reëu, bhajana-anuküla, “it is very favourable.” Bhakata-sevä parama-siddhi prema-latikära müla, “the love of Godhead is always compared with a creeper as the creeper in the garden takes the shelter of another big tree.” Similarly when we approach a pure devotee and engage ourselves in the service of that pure devotee that is our shelter exactly like the creeper takes shelter of a big tree. 
Prema-latikära, prema-latikära, “the creeper of love stands in that position.” Mädhava-tithi “and after that following the instructions of the pure devotee,” means “mädhava-tithi.” Just like Ekädaçé. Ekädaçé is called mädhava-tithi or Janmäñöamé any festival in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called mädhava-tithi. 
Mädhava-tithi bhakti-janané, “if we observe the performance of mädhava-tithi then that becomes the mother of our devotional service.” Bhakti-janané jetane pälana kori, “one has to observe this mädhava-tithi very carefully.” 
Kåñëa-basati basati boli' parama ädare bori, “and kåñëa-basati, or Kåñëa’s place just like Våndävana, Mathurä, Dvärakä they are famous as being Kåñëa’s favourites, so to live in such holy place one should be very much hankering after, kåñëa-basati.” 
Gaur ämära je-saba sthäne koralo bhramaëa raìge, “similarly Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu has travelled many places in India, ye-saba sthäne. So one should be very much eager to see those places.” Gaur ämära, je-saba sthäne koralo bhramaëa raìge, “wherever he has travelled.” 
Se-saba sthäna, heribo ämi praëayi-bhakata-saìge, “I want to see those places which in company with a pure devotee.” If ordinarily anyone goes to such places he will see only the street and the trees and the cars and the, but the same place when it is visited along with a devotee it has got a different effect. 
Mådaìga-bädya çunite mana abasara sadä jäce, “I wish to hear the sound vibration of mådaìga, kohl, it is very pleasing to me.” 
Gaura-bihita kértana çuni'änande hådoya näce, “and when I hear some song which is approved by the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahäprabhu then my heart dances with that song.” 
Jugala-mürti dekhiyä mora parama-änanda hoya, the deities there, Rädhä and Kåñëa, when I see. I feel transcendental pleasure. 
Prasäda-sebä korite hoya sakala prapaïca jaya, “and when I take, respect the prasädam offered to Kåñëa then I think that I am becoming liberated,” actually it is so. The more we eat ordinary foodstuff we become entangled. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that, yajïa-çiñöäçinaù santo mucyante sarva-kilbiñaiù [Bg 3.13]. 
[The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.]
“One who eats prasädam he becomes free from all contamination of life.” 
Whereas one who cooks for himself, generally people do so, generally the mass of people they purchase things, so many uneatable things, meats, fish eggs along with vegetables also. But they eat only sins, sinful life there but if you eat prasädam you become free from sin and if you do not eat prasädam you cook ordinary things for your eating then you become entangled instead. 
Je-dina gåhe bhajana dekhi gåhete goloka bhäya, “whenever I see at home there is worship of the Lord I think the, my household life is as good as Vaikuëöha.” 
Caraëa-sédhu dekhiyä gaìgäsukha nä sémä päya, “and whenever I see the Ganges,” because the Ganges is emanating from the toe’s of Lord Viñëu “therefore I become highly pleased, ecstatic by seeing the Ganges River.” 
Tulasé dekhi' juräya präëa, “and similarly whenever I see the Tulasé plant.”Mädhava-toñaëé jäni', “because I know that by offering Tulasé—Kåñëa is very much pleased therefore as soon as I see a Tulasé plant I become very much ecstatic.” 
Gaura-priya çäka-sevane jévana särthaka mäni, “similarly when I eat çäka,” green vegetable which is very dear to Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu, “I feel that my life is now successful.”
Bhakativinoda kåñëa-bhajane anaküla päya jähä, Bhaktivinode Öhäkura, Bhaktivinode Öhäkura says that “whatever I feel favourable in the matter of executing my devotional service unto the Supreme Lord every day.” 
Prati-dibase parama-sukhe swékära koroye tähä, “I accept all of them every day with great pleasure.”
Kåñëa-känti: Nine, nine minutes.
Prabhupäda: Hmm. 14 and 9.
Kåñëa-känti: Almost 15. Yes.
Prabhupäda: Almost 24. [end]

Purport by His Divine Grace 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda

This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. He's asking everyone to rise early in the morning. Vibhävaré çeña, the night is over, äloka-praveça, the glimpses of sunlight are there, now you get up. Nidrä chäri uöha jéva, don't sleep any more. That is the way of Vedic life. One should not sleep after sunrise. He must rise before sunrise. That is healthy life also. So just instantly after rising from the bed, one should chant the holy names of the Lord. Here it is suggested, bolo hari hari, now you chant Hare Kåñëa mantra, mukunda muräri, Kåñëa's different names. 
Mukunda means one who gives liberation. Murari, murari means Kåñëa the enemy of the demon of the name Mura. Räma is another name, celebrated, Räma, Kåñëa. Hayagréva, Hayagréva is another incarnation of Kåñëa. Similarly Nåsiàha, Nara-hari, half-lion, half-man, Nåsiàhadeva. Vämana incarnation, nåsiàha vämana, çri-madhusüdana. Madhusüdana, there was a demon Madhu, and Kaiöabha, they came to swallow up Brahmä after his creation, so they were killed. Therefore Kåñëa's another name is Madhusüdana. Madhusüdana name is found in Bhagavad-gétä in various places. Madhusüdana means the enemy of Madhu. Kåñëa is both friend and enemy. He is actually friend of everyone, but He becomes enemy-like for one who treats Kåñëa as enemy. He is nobody's enemy, but if anyone wants to see Him as enemy, He appears like enemy. That is absolute. The demons, they want to see Kåñëa as enemy, so accepting the desire of the demons, He appears before him as enemy, kills him, and gives him liberation. That is absolute pastime of Kåñëa, madhusüdana brajendra-nandana çyäma. Actually God has no name, but His names are selected according to His pastime. Just like this Madhusüdana name is given to Him because He killed the Madhu demon. 
Similarly, He is known as brajendra-nandana, the son of vraja, våndävana, because He appeared as the son of Yaçodä and Nanda Mahäräja, brajendra-nandana. Çyäma, His bodily hue is blackish, therefore He is called Çyämasundara. Pütanä-ghätana, kaiöabha-çätana, jaya däçarathi-räma. So because He killed the demon Pütanä, His name is pütanä-ghätana. Ghätana means killer. Kaitabha-çätana, and He is chastiser of all kinds of dangers. Jaya-däçarathi-räma. In connection of His killing the Rävaëa, He is glorified, jaya däçarathi. Däçarathi means: His father name was Däçaratha, so He is däçarathi, däçarathi-räma. Yaçodä-duläla govinda-gopäla. Yaçodä-duläla means pet son of Mother Yaçodä. Govinda-gopäla, and He is cowherds boy, Govinda, giving pleasure to the cows. Våndävana-purandara, the chief of the Våndävana land. He is the center of attraction for everyone in Våndävana. Räväëäntakara gopé-priya-jana, He is very favorable to the gopés, gopé-priya. Rädhikä-ramaëa, and He always enjoys the company of Rädhäräëé, therefore His name is Rädhikä-ramaëa. Bhuvana-sundara-bara. So He attracted so many gopés, that means He is attractive to the whole universe. Nobody is more attractive than Kåñëa within this universe, or within anywhere, therefore He is called bhuvana-sundara-bara. Bara means the chief. Räväëäntakara, mäkhana-taskara, gopé-jana-vastra-hari. 
As Räma, when He appeared as Lord Rämacandra, He killed Rävaëa, räväëäntakara. Mäkhana-taskara, and in Våndävana He is known as the butter thief. In His childhood pastime, He used to steal butter from the pots of the gopés. That was His pleasure pastime, therefore He is called mäkhana-taskara, mäkhanacora. Gopé-jana-vastra-hari, and He also stolen the garments of the gopés, while they were taking bath. This is very confidential. Actually the gopés wanted Kåñëa. They prayed to Kätyäyani-devé, goddess Kätyäyani, because He was attractive to all the girls of His age, so they wanted Kåñëa as husband. So, superficially, Kåñëa was of the same age, and how He could be husband for all the gopés? But He accepted. Because the gopés wanted to become wives of Kåñëa, therefore Kåñëa accepted their proposal. In order to show them the mercy, He stole the garments, because a husband can take away the covering of wife's bodily garment. Nobody can touch it. So that is the purpose, but people do not know. Therefore Kåñëa-lila has to be heard from a realized soul, or this portion should be avoided. Otherwise we shall misunderstand that Kåñëa took away the garments, and He was very much fallen, woman-hunter, like that. Not that. He is Supreme Lord. He fulfills the desire of every devotee. So Kåñëa had no business to see the gopés naked, but because they wanted to become wife, so He fulfilled their desire. A token, "Yes, I am your husband, I have taken your garment. Now you take your garment and go home.'' Therefore He is known as gopé-jana-vastra-hari. Brajera räkhäla, gopa-vånda-päla, citta-häré vaàçé-dhäré. Brajera-räkhäla, the cowherd boy in Våndävana, and gopa-vånda-päla, His object was how to satisfy the cowherds men, including His father, uncle, they were all keeping cows, to please them. So He's gopa-vånda-päla. Citta-häré vaàçé-dhäré, and when He was playing the flute, it was taking the heart of everyone, citta-häré. He was taking away the heart of everyone. Yogéndra-vandana, in spite of Kåñëa's playing as a small cowherd boy in Våndävana, just like the village boy making jokes with His friends, but still, He is yogéndra-vandana. Yogéndra means greatest yogi, mystic. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù [SB 12.13.1]. 
[Süta Gosvämé said: Unto that personality whom Brahmä, Varuëa, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise by chanting transcendental hymns and reciting the Vedas with all their corollaries, pada-kramas and Upaniñads, to whom the chanters of the Säma Veda always sing, whom the perfected yogés see within their minds after fixing themselves in trance and becoming fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, and whose limit can never be found by any demigod or demon—unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead I offer my humble obeisances.]
The yoginaù, the meditation, whom they are trying to find out? This Kåñëa. They are trying to find out Kåñëa. So unless they come to the point of concentrating their mind on Kåñëa, their yogic principle, or mystic power, is baffled. Yoginäm api sarveñäà mad-gata-antara [Bg 6.47]. 
[And of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.]
Yogi, first-class yogi, must keep always Kåñëa within his heart. That is perfection of yoga. Therefore it is called yogéndra-vandana, çré-nanda-nandana, braja-jana-bhaya-häré. Although He is worshiped by the great mystics, still He lives in Våndävana as son of Nanda Maharaja, and the residents of Våndävana, they feel safe and sound under protection of Kåñëa. Navéna nérada, rüpa manohara, mohana-vaàçé-vihäré. Navéna nérada, nérada means cloud, His complexion is just like new cloud. New cloud, blackish, rüpa. Still He is so beautiful. 
Generally black is not considered very beautiful within this material world, but because His body is transcendental, even He is blackish, He is the universally attractive. Rüpa manohara. Mohana-vaàçé-vihäré, simply when He stands with His flute, He, even though He is blackish, He becomes so attractive to everyone. Yaçodä-nandana, kaàsa-nisüdana, He is very much celebrated as the son of Mother Yaçodä, He is the killer of Kaàsa, and nikuïja-räsa-viläsé, and He used to dance, rasa dance, in the nikuïja, vaàçé-vaöa, nikuïja. Kadamba-känana räsa-paräyaëa, there are many kadamba trees. Kadamba is a kind of flower that is especially grown in Våndävana, very fragrant and beautiful, solid flower, round. So Kadamba-känana, He used to enjoy His rasa dance underneath the tree of this kadamba. Änanda-vardhana prema-niketana, phula-çara-yojaka käma. So He was exciting the lusty desires of the gopés, and increasing their transcendental bliss. Änanda-vardhana prema-niketana, because He is the reservoir of all pleasure. 
The gopés used to come to enjoy because He is the reservoir of all pleasure. Just like we go to take water from a lake where there is water. Similarly, if we want actually blissful life, then we shall draw it from the reservoir of all pleasure, Kåñëa. Änanda-vardhana, that pleasure will increase. The material pleasure will decrease, you cannot enjoy for a long time, it will decrease, but spiritual pleasure, if you want to draw it from the reservoir of all pleasure, Kåñëa, then it will increase. Your pleasure potency will increase, and you will get more and more pleasure. As you increase your pleasure potency, or desire, the supply is also incessant. 
There is no limit. Phula-çara-yojaka käma, He is the transcendental cupid. Cupid, with his bows and arrow, he increases the lusty desires of the material world. Similarly in the spiritual world, He is the supreme cupid. He was increasing the lusty desires of the gopés. They used to come there, and both of them, there was no decrease. They were increasing their desire, and Kåñëa was supplying them, without any material concept of life. They were simply dancing, that's all. Gopäìganä-gaëa, citta-vinodana, samasta-guëa-gaëa-dhäma. He's especially attractive for the gopäìganä. Gopäìganä means the dancers of vraja-dhama. Gopäìgaëa-gaëa, citta-vinodana, they were simply absorbed in Kåñëa's thought. They were so much became attracted by, attached to Kåñëa, they could not give up His existence of His form within the heart for a moment, citta-vinodana, He captured the heart of the gopé, citta-vinodana. Samasta-guëa-gaëa-dhäma, He is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. 
Yamunä-jévana, keli-paräyaëa, mänasa-candra-cakora. Mänasa-candra-cakora, there is a bird which is known as cakora. He looks toward the moonshine. Similarly, He was the moon amongst the gopés, and they were simply looking after Him. And He is the life of the river Yamunä, because He used to enjoy jumping over the river of Yamunä. Näma-sudhä-rasa, gäo kåñëa-yaça, räkho vacana. So Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura is requesting everyone, "Now you chant all these different names of the Lord, and save me.'' Räkho vacana mano: "My dear mind, please keep my word. Don't refuse, go on chanting all these holy names of Kåñëa."
