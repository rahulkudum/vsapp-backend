hare purport by his divine grace a c bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada the transcendental vibration established by the chanting of hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare is the sublime method of reviving our krsna consciousness as living spiritual souls we are all originally krsna conscious entities but due to our association with matter from time immemorial our consciousness is now polluted by the material atmosphere the material atmosphere in which we are now living is called maya or illusion maya means “that which is not ” and what is this illusion? the illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material nature while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws when a servant artificially tries to imitate the all powerful master this is called illusion in this polluted concept of life we are all trying to exploit the resources of material nature but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities therefore although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature we are ever more dependent on her this illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our krsna consciousness krsna consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind this consciousness is the original energy of the living entity when we hear the transcendental vibration this consciousness is revived and this process is recommended for this age by authorities by practical experience also one can perceive that by chanting this maha mantra or the great chanting for deliverance one can at once feel a transcendental ecstasy coming through from the spiritual stratum and when one is factually on the plane of spiritual understanding surpassing the stages of senses mind and intelligence one is situated on the transcendental plane this chanting of hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare is directly enacted from the spiritual platform and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciousness namely sensual mental and intellectual there is no need therefore to understand the language of the mantra nor is there any need for mental speculation or any intellectual adjustment for chanting this maha mantra it springs automatically from the spiritual platform and as such anyone can take part in the chanting without any previous qualification and dance in ecstasy we have seen this practically even a child can take part in the chanting or even a dog can take part in it of course for one who is too entangled in material life it takes a little more time to come to the standard point but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly when the mantra is chanted by a pure devotee of the lord in love it has the greatest efficacy on the hearers and as such this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the lord so that immediate effects can be achieved as far as possible chanting from the lips of non devotees should be avoided milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects the word hara is the form of addressing the energy of the lord and the words krsna and rama are forms of addressing the lord himself both krsna and rama mean “the supreme pleasure ” and hara is the supreme pleasure energy of the lord changed to hare in the vocative the supreme pleasure energy of the lord helps us to reach the lord the material energy called maya is also one of the multi energies of the lord and we the living entities are also the energy marginal energy of the lord the living entities are described as superior to material energy when the superior energy is in contact with the inferior energy an incompatible situation arises but when the superior marginal energy is in contact with the superior energy called hara the living entity is established in his happy normal condition these three words namely hare krsna and rama are the transcendental seeds of the maha mantra the chanting is a spiritual call for the lord and his internal energy hara to give protection to the conditioned soul this chanting is exactly like the genuine cry of a child for its mother mother hara helps the devotee achieve the grace of the supreme father hari or krsna and the lord reveals himself to the devotee who chants this mantra sincerely no other means of spiritual realization therefore is as effective in this age as chanting the maha mantra hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare temple program prayers song name samsara davanala lidha loka official name sri sri gurv astaka eight prayers to the guru mangala arati author visvanatha cakravarti thakura book

maha vishnu is the portion of portion 22 i adore the primeval lord govinda from whom the separated subjective portion brahma receives his power for the regulation of the mundane world just as the sun manifests some portion of his own light in all the effulgent gems that bear the names of suryakanta etc 23 i adore the primeval lord govinda whose lotus feet are always held by ganesa upon the pair of tumuli protruding from his elephant head in order to obtain power for his function of destroying all the obstacles on the path of progress of the three worlds 24 the three worlds are composed of the nine elements viz fire earth ether water air direction time soul and mind i adore the primeval lord govinda from whom they originate in whom they exist and into whom they enter at the time of the

imbued with devotion and impartially ordains for each the due enjoyment of the fruits of one's activities of all those who walk in the path of work in accordance with the chain of their previously

meditating upon him under the sway of wrath amorous passion natural friendly love fear parental affection delusion reverence and willing service attain to bodily forms befitting the nature of their contemplation 29 i worship that transcendental seat known as svetadvipa where as loving consorts the laksmis in their unalloyed spiritual essence practice the amorous service of the supreme lord

stored away 3 you are quite confident in presenting yourself as a saintly spiritual master and thus you are busily engaged in initiating innocent people by reciting krishna nama into their ear is this

the human form of life is the rarest opportunity for attaining spiritual perfection but now i am lamenting because i've somehow or other been born with such an opportunity and i wasted it by never worshiping lord krsna oh to whom shall i tell the tale of this misery? 2 having married and entered into the entanglements of materialistic family life i passed my time in vain i never got any tangible gain or permanent benefit only trouble and botheration 3 what kind of world is this anyway? it seems to be just like a magic lantern show that i saw at a carnival wherein so many shadows and optical illusions dance magically before my eyes i feel great attachment and identification with such a world and thus day after day passby fruitlessly without any purpose whatsoever 4 when this body drops dead on the ground then what will remain mine? at that moment all of my sons and dearest loved ones will not be able to give me any happiness 5 i work hard just like an ass everyday and now i am wondering for whom am i working so hard? i am still surrounded by so many illusions 6 i waste every day in useless insignificant work and i waste every night controlled by sleep and in every 24 hours i never for one second consider that cruel death is sitting very close by my side 7 i live a very carefree life style sometimes eating a lot or eating a little if i feel like it sometimes i see nice things around the town or sometimes i do not go out at all sometimes i wear opulent clothing or if i'm in the mood i'll wear something simple i live so carefree that i never consider that one day i will have to give up this body 8 my poor heart is plagued by constant anxieties about the maintenance and daily turmoil created by my body my house my wife my family members and my social obligations all these anxieties are pinching me and destroying all my intelligence 9 alas alas what a remorseful situation has arisen i am absorbed in all this trouble but i never consider that all these things are temporary and subject to perish very soon after i'm dead and gone where will all of my material opulences remain? 10 when my body will be thrown in the pit at the cremation grounds it will simply lie there motionlessly then many crows vultures ants and worms will come and playfully sport there 11 all the stray dogs and jackals will then become very much delighted and in great ecstasy they will make a festival ground out of my body and will have a huge celebration and feast 12 just see this is the ultimate destination of this material body and the most amazing thing is that all of my material opulences house family and friends have exactly the same destination 13 therefore i ask of anyone who has any sharp intelligence please give up all of these temporary illusions presented by maya and kindly search after the means to get pure devotion to lord krsna for this is the only really tangible eternal truth song name ekhona bujhinu author bhaktivinoda thakura book name saranagati

yourself of the eternal treasure waiting for you the supreme goal of life 5 just become a little thoughtful for once and reflect back on your own life story how many demoniac temptations you were motivated by simply to get a little sense gratification how many unlimitedly sinful acts have you committed? so now just see the result the only gain in the long run is your certain death 6 alas never having once considered the purpose or goal of human existence such a person wastes his entire life just like a dog or a pig then at the time of death being bereft and cheated out of any means of deliverance he laments bitterly and burning the fire of repentance 7 my dear mind so tell me why you remain stupefied and unconscious absorbed in this useless temporary sense gratification? i want you to give it up right now and give up all hopes for future sense gratification as well for the expectation of this humble servant is that you will be able to conquer over this miserable material

kind upon this useless soul but i do not know why you have brought me here now you can do whatever you like with me 2 but i guess you have some business here otherwise why would you bring me to this terrible place? 3 most of the population here is covered by the material modes of ignorance and passion absorbed in material life they think themselves very happy and satisfied and therefore they have no taste for the transcendental message of vasudeva i do not know how they will be able to understand it 4 but i know your causeless mercy can make everything possible because you are the most expert mystic 5 how will they understand the mellows of devotional service? o lord i am simply praying for your mercy so that i will be able to convince them about your message 6 all living entities have come under the control of the illusory energy by your will and therefore if you like by your will they can also be released from the clutches of illusion 7 i wish that you may deliver them therefore if you so desire their deliverance then only will they be able to understand your message 8 the words of srimad bhagavatam are your incarnation and if a sober person repeatedly receives it with submissive aural reception then he will be able to understand your message 9 it is said in the srimad bhagavatam 1 2 17 21 "sri krishna the personality of godhead who is the paramatma [supersoul] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear his messages which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted by regular attendance in classes on the bhagavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service unto the personality of godhead who is praised with transcendental songs is established as an irrevocable fact as soon as irrevocable loving service is established in the heart the effects of nature’s modes of passion and ignorance such as lust desire and hankering disappear from the heart then the devotee is established in goodness and he becomes completely happy thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness the man whose mind has been enlivened by contact with devotional service to the lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the personality of godhead in the stage of liberation from all material association thus the knot in the heart is pierced and all misgivings are cut to pieces the chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the self as master " 10 he will become liberated from the influence of the modes of ignorance and passion and thus all inauspicious things accumulated in the core of the heart will disappear 11 how will i make them understand this message of krishna consciousness? i am very unfortunate unqualified and the most fallen therefore i am seeking your benediction so that i can convince them for i am powerless to do so on my own 12 somehow or other o lord you have brought me here to speak about you now my lord it is up to you to make me a success or failure as you like 13 o spiritual master of all the worlds i can simply repeat your message so if you like you can make my power of speaking suitable for their understanding 14 only by your causeless mercy will my words become pure i am sure that when this transcendental message penetrates their hearts they will certainly feel engladdened and thus become liberated from all unhappy conditions of life 15 o lord i am just like a puppet in your hands so if you have brought me here to dance then make me dance make me dance o lord make me dance as you like 16 i have no devotion nor do i have any knowledge but i have strong faith in the holy name of krsna i have been designated as bhaktivedanta and now if you like you can fulfill the real purport of bhaktivedanta song name krsna tava punya habe bhai official name bhagavan krsner pada padme prarthana

brother the supreme lord krsna will bestow virtue upon you but he will do this only when srimati radharani first becomes pleased with you this i surely declare to you 1 sri srimad bhaktisiddhanta sarasvati thakura who is very dear to lord gauranga the son of mother saci is unparalleled in his service to the supreme lord sri krsna he is that great saintly spiritual master most magnanimous within this universe who bestows devotion to krsna in various places throughout the world 2 his desire is very powerful and thus he is causing the holy name of lord gauranga to spread throughout all the countries of the western world in all the cities towns and villages on the earth extending to all the oceans rivers and streams everyone may accept the holy name of krsna 3 thus all directions will be conquered by a flood of transcendental ecstasy flowing with the excessive mercy of sri caitanya mahaprabhu when all the miserable living entities that have been corrupted by maya become happy then the vaisnava's desire is fulfilled 4 although my guru maharaja ordered me to accomplish this mission i am unworthy to do it being very fallen and incompetent that being the case o lord krsna your mercy is today arising in a befitting manner to make me become worthy for you are the wisest of all 5 if you bestow your divine power then one attains the factual substance which is service to the spiritual master and life becomes successful if that service is obtained then one becomes truly satisfied and ultimately receives your association due to good fortune 6 as stated by prahlada maharaja to lord nrsimhadeva in the srimad bhagavatam 7 9 28 "thus by associating with material desires one after another i was following the general populace by falling into a blind well full of snakes my dear lord o supreme personality of godhead then the great sage narada muni kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve the transcendental position similar to his own how could i ever leave the service of your servant?" 7 o lord krsna you are my eternal companion forgetting you i have suffered the kicking of maya birth after birth if today the chance to meet you occurs again then surely i will be able to rejoin you 8 o my dear brother in your company i will experience great joy once again wandering about the pastures and fields i will pass the entire day with you in tending the cows joking with you and frolicking throughout so many forests of vraja i will roll upon the ground in spiritual ecstasy when oh when will that day be mine? 9 today that remembrance of being with you came to me in a very nice way feeling great longing i called out for you o lord krsna only because i am your eternal servant do i desire your association so much except for you i have

to the fallen and wretched souls who did not desire it 4 the ocean of mercy had formerly been sealed tight but nitai cut a channel in its boundary to allow the great flooding waves of nectarean prema

very merciful they are the essence of all incarnations the specific significance of these incarnations is that they introduced a process of chanting and dancing that is simply joyful 2 my dear brother i request that you just worship lord caitanya and nityananda with firm conviction and faith if one wants to be krsna conscious by this process one has to give up his engagement in sense gratification one simply has to chant "hare krsna hari hari " without any motive 3 my dear brother just try and examine this within the three worlds there is no one like lord caitanya or lord nityananda their merciful qualities are so great that upon hearing them even birds and beasts cry and stones melt 4 but locana dasa regrets that i am entrapped by sense gratification since i have no attraction for the

place is only for the sake of attaining the false prestige of a worldly reputation it is nothing but pure hypocrisy 2 such materialistic prestige is as disgusting as the stool of a hog do you not know that it is only a mere illusion cast by the potency of maya? what is the value of contemplating day and night your plans for enjoying wealth and women? all these things are only temporary 3 when you claim wealth as your own it creates in you ever increasing desires for material enjoyment your riches should be used for serving madhava the lord of all wealth neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust for women whose only true proprietor is lord yadava 4 the demon ravana lust incarnate fought with lord ramachandra love incarnate in order to gain the tree of worldly reputation but that oasis turned out to be but a mirage cast in the desert wasteland of the lord's illusory material potency please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and solid platform whereupon a vaisnava ever stands if you neglect worshiping the lord from this position then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence 5 why do you needlessly suffer the torment of blaspheming the devotees of lord hari attempting to achieve their eminence thereby only proving your own fruitless foolishness? the desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one becomes a devotee of the lord for eternal fame automatically follows the heels of a vaisnava and that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly opulence 6 the relationship between a devotee and lord hari is devoid of even a trace of worldly illusion it has nothing to do with the materialistic cheating propensity the prestige of so called popularity in the material realm is compared to a treacherous dog eating witch and the attempt to live in solitude to supposedly engage in unalloyed bhajan is compared to an entangling network of distraction please know that anyone striving in either of these ways verily lives in the hell of maya's illusion 7 "i shall give up chanting the lord's name publicly in kirtan and retire to solitude thus smearing myself with worldly honor " dear mind what is the good of seeking such so called glory? i will always remind you that the great soul madhavendra puri never deceived himself in that regard by committing theft in his own storehouse of perception the way you do 8 your cheap reputation is equal to the stool of a hog an ordinary ambitious man like you can never be equated with a devotee of madhavendra puri's eminence under the sway of envy you have drowned yourself in the filthy waters of material enjoyment after having abandoned the excellent perfection of congregational kirtan 9 truly o wicked mind the glories of so called solitary worship are propagated only by false yogis using unscrupulous means to deceive others to save yourself from these pitfalls please contemplate the instructions that the supreme lord sri chaitanya mahaprabhu kindly gave us while addressing srila sanatana goswami with the utmost care 10 do not forget for a moment the two most valuable concepts that he taught 1 the principle of dry apparent renunciation as opposed to real appropriate renunciation and 2 the principle of a soul being trapped in the bondage of matter as opposed to a soul who is liberated don't ever make the mistake of thinking that these conflicting concepts are on the same level please remember this while engaging yourself in chanting the lord's holy names as loud as you possibly can 11 one is truly a vaisnava who has given up the habit of falling victim to the ferocious tigress of wealth beauty and fame such a soul is factually detached from material life and is known as a pure devotee someone with this consciousness of detachment has thereby become victorious over the mundane world of birth and death 12 one is indeed detached who moderately partakes of worldly things that are deemed necessary for living in devotional service a devotee acting in that manner does not fall prey to the disease of material infatuation thus devoid of selfish attachment and endowed with the ability to see things in relation to the lord all sense objects are then directly perceived as being lord madhava himself 13 this is the standard of befitting renunciation and one who realizes this is most fortunate indeed everything involved in such a devotee's life represents lord hari's personal spiritual opulence as manifest in the world of matter on the other hand one who engages in chanting the lord's name with hopes of enhancing his own material reputation finds that all his activities and paraphernalia represent only the riches of hypocrisy 14 o mind please reject the company of two types of persons those desiring impersonal liberation from the material world and those who desire to enjoy the pleasure of material sense objects both of these are equally non devotees the things that are used in relation to lord krsna are objects belonging directly to the transcendental realm and thus having nothing to do with matter they cannot be either owned or forsaken by persons interested in mundane enjoyment or renunciation 15 an impersonal philospher is opposed to thinking of krsna as an object of devotion and thus being puffed up with the false pride of imaginary liberation he dares to criticize the true devotees of the lord o mind you are the servant of the vaisnavas and you should always hope for attaining devotion why then do you make such a loud commotion by calling to me and trying to prove the supposed supremacy of your practice of solitary worship? 16 one who falsely gives up things that could actually be used in the lord's service proudly calls himself a renunciate ' but unfortunately he can never become a vaisnava by such an attitude abandoning his servitorship to the lotus feet of lord hari and resigning himself to his solitary home whatever is gained by that exercise can only be the worthless treasure of deception 17 ever engage yourself in the service of sri radha and keep aloof from the vicious snake of materialistic sense gratification the glory of participating in the lord's kirtan is not meant to bolster anyone's ambitions for personal recognition o mind why then have you abandoned the identity of being radha's eternal servant in favor of retiring to a solitary place to practice the cheating process of so called bhajan? 18 the most valuable treasures amongst the lord's preachers are the eternal personalities residing in vraja dham they never occupy themselves with begging for worthless material reputation which is cherished only by the living dead the vraja vasis are truly infused with life and therefore they preach in order to give life to the walking corpses of the mundane world all the songs that the vraja vasis sing about the glories of lord krsna are devoid of any tinge of desire for fame 19 srila bhaktisiddhanta saraswati servant of radha and her beloved krsna always hopes for kirtan and he begs all to loudly sing the names of lord hari the transcendental power of congregational chanting automatically awakens remembrance of the lord and his divine pastimes in relation to one's own eternal spiritual form only at that time does it become possible to go off to a solitary place and engage in the confidential worship of their lordships song name krsna hoite caturmukha official name sri guru parampara author bhaktisiddhanta saraswti 1 krsna hoite catur mukha hoy krsna sevonmukha brahma hoite naradera mati narada hoite vyasa

in the beginning of creation the science of devotional service was received by the four headed brahma from the supreme lord sri krsna devarsi narada's understanding of this divine science was obtained from brahma the great sage krsna dvaipayana vyasa who was empowered to compile the vedic literatures became a disciple of devarsi narada sripada madhvacarya the founder of the suddha dvaita school of vedanta philosophy who visited vyasadeva at badarikasrama in the thirteenth century to learn from him vedanta philosophy calls himself a servant of krsna dvaipayana vyasa purnaprajna tirtha [madhva] is the guru and sole refuge of padmanabha tirtha 2 the two other principal disciples of madhva are nrhari tirtha and madhava tirtha madhava tirtha accepted the great paramhamsa aksobhya tirtha as a disciple the principal disciple of aksobhya tirtha was known as jayatirtha jayatirtha's service was for his disciple jnanasindhu 3 dayanidhi received the science of devotional service from jnanasindhu and the servant of dayanidhi was vidyanidhi [vidyadhiraja tirtha] rajendra tirtha became a disciple of vidyadhiraja tirtha rajendra tirtha's servant was known as jayadharma or vijayadhvaja tirtha in this way you should properly understand this disciplic succession 4 the great sannyasi sri purusottama tirtha received his knowledge in the service of his guru vijayadhvaja tirtha [jayadharma] the principal disciple of purusottama tirtha was subrahmanya tirtha his servant was the great vyasatirtha [vyasa raya] vyasatirtha's servant was laksmipati tirtha whose disciple was madhavendra puri gosvami 5 the chief disciple of madhavendra puri was isvara puri and two of his other disciples were the renowned incarnations of godhead sri nityananda and advaita acarya sri caitanya mahaprabhu the spiritual preceptor of all the worlds made isvari puri greatly fortunate by accepting him as his spiritual master 6 mahaprabhu sri caitanya is non different from sri sri radha and krsna and is the very life of those vaisnavas who follow sri rupa gosvami sri svarupa damodara gosvami rupa gosvami and sanatana gosvami were the givers of great happiness to visvambhara [sri caitanya] 7 the great souls jiva gosvami and raghunatha dasa gosvami became very dear to rupa gosvami jiva gosvami was a disciple of rupa gosvami and raghunatha dasa gosvami a disciple of advaita acarya's disciple

lokanatha gosvami they lived together in vrndavana and always discussed the topics of krsna with one another lokanatha gosvami a disciple of gadadhara pandita had only one disciple whose name was narottama dasa narottama dasa was always engaged in the service of his guru and he also engaged himself in the service of his guru's intimate friend thus he became very dear to krsnadasa kaviraja gosvami to serve i the feet of narottama dasa thakura was the only desire of visvanatha cakravarti thakura who was the fourth acarya in disciplic succession from narottama dasa 8 visvanatha cakravarti thakura was the siksa guru [instructing spiritual master] of baladeva vidyabhusana to whom he taught the precepts of srimad bhagavatam jagannatha dasa babaji was a very prominent acarya after sri

embodiment of eternal existence knowledge and bliss whose shark shaped earrings are swinging to and fro who is beautifully shining in the divine realm of gokula who i due to the offense of breaking the pot of yogurt that his mother was churning into butter and then stealing the butter that was kept hanging from a swing is quickly running from the wooden grinding mortar in fear of mother yasoda but who has been caught from behind by her who ran after him with greater speed to that supreme lord sri damodara i offer my humble obeisances 2 seeing the whipping stick in his mother's hand he is crying and rubbing his eyes again and again with his two lotus hands his eyes are filled with fear and the necklace of pearls around his neck which is marked with three lines like a conch shell is shaking because of his quick breathing due to crying to this supreme lord sri damodara whose belly is bound not with ropes but with his mother's pure love i offer my humble obeisances 3 by such childhood pastimes as this he is drowning the inhabitants of gokula in pools of ecstasy and is revealing to those devotees who are absorbed in knowledge of his supreme majesty and opulence that he is only conquered by devotees whose pure love is imbued with intimacy and is free from all conceptions of awe and reverence with great love i again offer my obeisances to lord damodara hundreds and hundreds of times 4 o lord although you are able to give all kinds of benedictions i do not pray to you for the boon of impersonal liberation nor the highest liberation of eternal life in vaikuntha nor any other boon which may be obtained by executing the nine processes of bhakti o lord i simply wish that this form of yours as bala gopala in vrndavana may ever be manifest in my heart for what is the use to me of any other boon besides this? 5 o lord your lotus face which is encircled by locks of soft black hair tinged with red is kissed again and again by mother yasoda and your lips are reddish like the bimba fruit may this beautiful vision of your lotus face be ever manifest in my heart thousands and thousands of other benedictions are of no use to me 6 o supreme godhead i offer my obeisances unto you o damodara o ananta o vishnu o master o my lord be pleased upon me by showering your glance of mercy upon me deliver this poor ignorant fool who is immersed in an ocean of worldly sorrows and become visible to my eyes 7 o lord damodara just as the two sons of kuvera manigriva and nalakuvara were delivered from the curse of narada and made into great devotees by you in your form as a baby tied with rope to a wooden grinding mortar in the same way please give to me your own prema bhakti i only long for this and have no desire for any kind of liberation 8 o lord damodara i first of all offer my obeisances to the brilliantly effulgent rope which binds your belly i then offer my obeisances to your belly which is the abode of the entire universe i humbly bow down to your most beloved srimati radharani and i offer all obeisances to you the supreme lord who displays unlimited pastimes song name jayati te 'dhikam janmana vrajah official name gopi gitam the gopis’ songs

resides here it is only for your sake that we your devoted servants maintain our lives we have been searching everywhere for you so please show yourself to us 2 o lord of love in beauty your glance excels the whorl of the finest most perfectly formed lotus within the autumn pond o bestower of benedictions you are killing the maidservants who have given themselves to you freely without any price isn't this murder? 3 o greatest of personalities you have repeatedly saved us from all kinds of danger — from poisoned water from the terrible man eater agha from the great rains from the wind demon from the fiery thunderbolt of indra from the bull demon and from the son of maya danava 4 you are not actually the son of the gopi yasoda o friend but rather the indwelling witness in the hearts of all embodied souls because lord brahma prayed for you to come and protect the universe you have now appeared in the satvata dynasty 5 o best of the vrsnis your lotuslike hand which holds the hand of the goddess of fortune grants fearlessness to those who approach your feet out of fear of material existence o lover please place that wish fulfilling lotus hand on our heads 6 o you who destroy the suffering of vraja's people o hero of all women your smile shatters the false pride of your devotees please dear friend accept us as your maidservants and show us your beautiful lotus face 7 your lotus feet destroy the past sins of all embodied souls who surrender to them those feet follow after the cows in the pastures and are the eternal abode of the goddess of fortune since you once put those feet on the hoods of the great serpent kaliya please place them upon our breasts and tear away the lust in our hearts 8 o lotus eyed one your sweet voice and charming words which attract the minds of the intelligent are bewildering us more and more our dear hero please revive your maidservants with the nectar of your lips 9 the nectar of your words and the descriptions of your activities are the life and soul of those suffering in this material world these narrations transmitted by learned sages eradicate one's sinful reactions and bestow good fortune upon whoever hears them these narrations are broadcast all over the world and are filled with spiritual power certainly those who spread the message of godhead are most munificent 10 your smiles your sweet loving glances the intimate pastimes and confidential talks we enjoyed with you — all these are auspicious to meditate upon and they touch our hearts but at the same time o deceiver they very much agitate our minds 11 dear master dear lover when you leave the cowherd village to herd the cows our minds are disturbed with the thought that your feet more beautiful than a lotus will be pricked by the spiked husks of grain and the rough grass and plants 12 at the end of the day you repeatedly show us your lotus face covered with dark blue locks of hair and thickly powdered with dust thus o hero you arouse lusty desires in our minds 13 your lotus feet which are worshiped by lord brahma fulfill the desires of all who bow down to them they are the ornament of the earth they give the highest satisfaction and in times of danger they are the appropriate object of meditation o lover o destroyer of anxiety please put those lotus feet upon our breasts 14 o hero kindly distribute to us the nectar of your lips which enhances conjugal pleasure and vanquishes grief that nectar is thoroughly relished by your vibrating flute and makes people forget any other attachment 15 when you go off to the forest during the day a tiny fraction of a second becomes like a millennium for us because we cannot see you and even when we can eagerly look upon your beautiful face so lovely with its adornment of curly locks our pleasure is hindered by our eyelids which were fashioned by the foolish creator 16 dear acyuta you know very well why we have come here who but a cheater like you would abandon young women who come to see him in the middle of the night enchanted by the loud song of his flute? just to see you we have completely rejected our husbands children ancestors brothers and other relatives 17 our minds are repeatedly bewildered as we think of the intimate conversations we had with you in secret feel the rise of lust in our hearts and remember your smiling face your loving glances and your broad chest the resting place of the goddess of fortune thus we experience the most severe hankering for you 18 o beloved your all auspicious appearance vanquishes the distress of those living in vraja's forests our minds long for your association please give to us just a bit of that medicine which counteracts the disease in your devotees' hearts 19 o dearly beloved your lotus feet are so soft that we place them gently on our breasts fearing that your feet will be hurt our life rests only in you our minds therefore are filled with anxiety that your tender feet might be wounded by pebbles as

sound of his own name he began to dance in ecstasy 2 in srivasa angana srivasa thakura’s divine courtyard he inaugurated the auspicious reverberations of the kirtana in a booming voice “gopala govinda ” 3 in the courtyard the sounds of the mrdanga small cymbals conch karatalas and beautiful singing all mixed together 4 the loud sound passed through the entire brahmanda and filled the whole sky reaching svetadvipa destroying everything inauspicious in all the fourteen worlds 5 from morning visvambhara he who nourishes and maintains the whole universe by bhakti started dancing many groups sang charmingly – each group singing a different melody 6 srivasa pandita was the guru of one group of kirtaniyas and mukunda was the lead singer of another 7 govinda ghosa was the head of another group gauracandra danced in the middle of the whole kirtana party 8 the mighty nityananda prabhu protected mahaprabhu when he swooned while dancing as advaita acarya secretly took his foot dust at that time 9 tears came to gadadhara mukunda sridhara and others upon hearing mahaprabhu’s kirtana as the rising of asta sattvika bhavas overwhelmed their hearts 10 visvambhara danced with so much force that the earth trembled causing all the devotees to become afraid 11 sometimes visvambhara danced so gracefully and sweetly that he appeared to be natavara nanda nandana the best of dancers 12 mahaprabhu’s beauty is unequalled and unsurpassed defeating even krsna’s beauty even krsna has no mahabhava all his followers’ eyes filled with ananda seeing his dancing 13 mahaprabhu visvambhara danced absorbed in ananda hearing the rhythm of his dancing feet the devotees became spellbound 14 as mahaprabhu danced being filled with bhava his garland could not stay around his neck but broke all the flowers falling at the feet of his devotees 15 the auspicious sounds of sri harinama sankirtana spread in every direction while jagannatha misra’s son danced in the midst of all the devotees 16 siva chants the same blissful name and becomes so absorbed in prema that his cloth falls down hearing mahaprabhu’s glories siva starts to dance and mahaprabhu hearing his own glories also dances 17 by this same nama valmiki achieved the wealth of austerity – he saw all rama lila and by this same nama all of ajamila’s anarthas and aparadhas were pulled out by the root 18 hearing sri krsna nama totally cuts all worldly attachments sri krsna himself came in kali yuga as mahaprabhu dancing and advising all to chant krsna nama 19 sukadeva and narada also chant this krsna nama and distribute it with thousands of tongues mahaprabhu sings the glories of this nama 20 taking mahaprabhu’s name constitutes the highest form of atonement seeing mahaprabhu dancing the devotees became supremely fortunate 21 seeing mahaprabhu’s bliss the devotees embraced each other and wept loudly as the rays of mahaprabhu’s ananda entered their hearts 22 all the devotees attended kirtana and mahaprabhu personally decorated their bodies with candana and garlands sri gaurasundara and the devotees sang and tasted krsnarasa with great joy 23 absorbed in kirtana all the vaisnava devotees completely lost sense of their own bodies and everyone else around them 24 “jaya krsna murari mukunda vanamali ” day and night all the devotees sang kirtana in great happiness 25 visvambhara danced twenty four hours with his devotees but never tired because his body was sattva kalevara fully transcendental 26 daily mahaprabhu in full prema danced in kirtana the whole night and only stopped three hours before sunrise 27 daily mahaprabhu the hero who enjoys the prema rasa of vaikuntha svetadvipa tasted and distributed great bliss in navadvipa 28 gauracandra and all his associates enter in the hearts of the devotees who hear the allvirtuous hari katha with full faith thus their hearts become srivasa angana 29 vrndavana dasa says “sri krsna caitanya and the moon like nityananda prabhu are my life and soul

brahmanas the gayatri mantra the holy name and the transcendental shelter that is the fresh young couple of vraja radha and krsna 2 o mind don’t concern yourself with the pious and impious deeds described in the vedas rather intently serve sri sri radha krsna in vraja always remember that lord caitanya is the son of maharaja nanda and that my guru is most dear to lord mukunda 3 o mind just listen to me if you desire to reside in vraja birth after birth and if you desire to directly serve the divine youthful couple there with great attraction then with intense love always remember and bow down to srila svarupa damodara gosvami to srila rupa gosvami and his elder brother srila sanatana gosvami and to all their associates and followers 4 o mind give up friendship with nondevotees which is nothing but a prostitute who will steal the treasure of your heart–your desire to serve radha krsna don’t listen to talks of impersonal liberation which are a tigress who devours everyone you should even give up attraction for lord narayana which leads to the world of vaikuntha instead o mind just worship sri sri radha krsna in vraja for they bestow upon their worshipers the jewel of pure love for themselves 5 the highwaymen of lust and his friends have bound me around the neck with the painful horrible powerful ropes of many wicked deeds o mind please scream out to the devotees of krsna the killer of baka "i am being killed " then he will save me 6 o mind why do you burn us both by bathing in the urine trickling from the ass of great deviousness and hypocrisy? instead you should delight us by eternally bathing in the glistening nectar ocean of pure love for sri sri gandharva giridhari sri sri radha krsna 7 as long as the impudent untouchable woman of the desire for fame dances in my heart why should pure love for radha krsna touch me? o mind continuously serve my spiritual master the leader of those who are dear to the lord then my master will quickly kick out that harridan and allow that pure love to enter 8 so that he will mercifully smash my wickedness even though i am a great rascal so that he will give me the splendid nectar of transcendental love and so he will engage me in sri radha’s service please o mind with words choked with emotion worship lord giridhari here in vraja 9 o mind please meditate on krsna the moon of vraja forest as the lord of my controller srimati radharani and please meditate upon srimati radharani the queen of vraja forest as krsna’s controller also please meditate upon lalita as the peerless friend of radha and krsna visakha as the guru who teaches them many things and radha kunda and govardhana hill as two places the mere sight of which bestows charming transcendental love for the divine couple 10 o mind please worship lord hari’s beloved radha with the splendor of her beauty she makes rati gauri and lila burn with envy with the power of her good fortune she defeats saci laksmi and satyabhama and with her ability to control krsna she completely eclipses candravali and the other pious young girls of vraja 11 o mind in order to attain the direct service of the two divine lovers sri sri radha giridhari in the company of their friends every day you must constantly drink with sri rupa gosvami the five nectars of worshiping them chanting their names meditating on them hearing about them and bowing down before them and every day you must worship govardhana hill 12 these eleven excellent instructions to the mind grant all spiritual benedictions a person who stays with the devotees follows srila rupa
