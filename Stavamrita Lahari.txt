Song 1 


Text 1
sri sri Gurvastaka

samsara-davanala-lidha-loka-
tranaya karunya-ghanaghanatvam
praptasya kalyana-gunarnavasya
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

The spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean of mercy.  Just as a cloud pours water on a forest-fire to extinguish it, so the spiritual master delivers the materially afflicted world by extinguishing the blazing fire of material existence.  I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.

Text 2
mahaprabhoh kirtana-nrtya-gita-
vaditra-madyan manaso rasena
romanca-kampasru-taranga-bhajo
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

Chanting the holy name, dancing in ecstasy, singing, and playing musical instruments, the spiritual master is always gladdened by the sankirtana movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.  Because he is relishing the mellows of pure devotion within his mind, sometimes his hair stands on end, he feels quivering in his body, and tears flow from his eyes like waves.  I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

The spiritual master is always engaged in the temple worship of Sri Sri Radha and Krsna.  He also engages his disciples in such worship.  They dress the Deities in beautiful clothes and ornaments, clean Their temple, and perform other similar worship of the Lord.  I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

Text 4
catur-vidha-sri-bhagavat-prasada
svada-anna-trptan hari-bhakta-sanghan
krtvaiva trptim bhajatah sadaiva
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

The spiritual master is always offering Krsna four kinds of delicious food [analysed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk, and sucked].  When the spiritual master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating bhagavat-prasada, he is satisfied.  I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

Text 5
sri-radhika-madhavayor apara
madhurya-lila-funa-rupa-namnam
prati-ksanasvadana-lolupasya
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

The spiritual master is always eager to hear and chant about the unlimited conjugal pastimes of Radhika and Madhava, and their qualities, names, and forms.  The spiritual master aspires to relish these at every moment.  I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

Text 6
nikunja-yuno rati-keli-siddhyai
ya yalibhir yuktir apeksaniya
tatrati-daksyad ati-vallabhasya
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

The spiritual master is very dear, because he is expert in assisting the gopis, who at different times make different tasteful arrangements for the perfection of Radha and Krsna conjugal loving affairs within the groves of Vrndavana.  I offer my most humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

Text 7
saksad-dharitvena samasta-sastrair
uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih
kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya
vande guroh sri caranaravindam

The spiritual master is to be honoured as much as the Supreme Lord, because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord.  This is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities.  Therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a bona fide representation of Sri Hari [Krsna].

Text 8
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gitah kuto 'pi
dhyayan stuvams tasya yasa tri-sandhyam
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam

By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of Krsna.  Without the grace of the spiritual master, on cannot make any advancement.  Therefore, I should always remember and praise the spiritual master.  At least three times a day I should offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master.

Text 9
srimad-guror astakam etad uccair
brahme muhurte pathati prayatnat
yas tena vrndavana-natha-saksat-
sevaiva labhya januso ‘nta eva

One who during the brahma-muhurta hour carefully recites these eight prayers glorifying the spiritual master will at the end of this life attain direct service to the Lord of Vrndavana.

sri Saci-nandana-vijayastaka

gadadhara yada parah sa kila ksacanalokito
maya srita-gayadhavana madhura-murtir ekas tada
navambuda iva bruvan dhrta-navambudo netrayor
luthan bhuvi niruddha-vag vijayate saci-nandanah

One day, Gadadhara Pandita heard the following words: O Gadadhara! I saw the most extraordinary person on the road to Gaya.  His form was very handsome, and He roared just like a thundercloud.  His eyes rained tears as if they had become rain clouds, and He rolled about on the ground, His voice choked up in the ecstasy of love of God.  All glories to that Lord, the son of Saci-devi.

Text 2

Oh, what kind of extraordinary state has He attained?  Although He is the leader of the scholars, He no longer delights in study.  When He holds class, surrounded by his pupils, if He hears the sound “Hari”, He begins to tremble.  All glories to that Lord, the son of Saci-devi.

Text 3
haha kim idam ucyate patha pathatra krsnam muhur
vina tam iha sadhutam dadhati kim buddha dhatavah
prasiddha iha varna-sanghatita-samyag-amnayakah
sva-namni yad iti bruvan vijayate saci-nandanah

Once during class Lord Caitanya interrupted a pupil and asked, ‘What are you saying?  Instead of these verbs, you should constantly repeat the name of Krsna, the most famous of all worlds according to the Vedas.  O students, without Krsna, what benefit can verbs give?’  All glories to Lord Caitanya, the son of Saci-devi, who chants His own holy name in that way.

Text 4
navambuja-dale yad-iksana-savarnata-dirghate

sa pathayati vismitan smita-mukhah sva-sisyan iti

No matter what the particular topic of study was, He would smile and instruct His astonished grammar students in this way: ‘O students, please place the two large eyes of Sri Krsna, which are as beautiful as two lotus petals, within your hearts, and please place His lotus feet within your hearts in the same way.’  All glories to that Lord, the son of Saci-devi.

Text 5
kva yani karavani kim kva nu maya harir labhyatam
tam udisatu kah sakhe kathaya kah prapadyeta mam
iti dravati ghurnate kalita-bhakta-kanthah suca
sa murchayati mataram vijayate saci-nandanah

At other times, the Lord would say, ‘O friend, where shall I go, and what shall I do to attain Lord Hari?’  Who will show Him to Me?  Please tell me who will help me in this way’.  Speaking thus, the Lord ran here and there and rolled about on the ground.  Their throats filled with grief, the stricken devotees called out to Him.  In this way the Lord caused His mother Saci-devi, to faint.  All glories to that Lord, the son of Saci-devi.

Text 6
smararbuda-durapaya tanu-ruci-chata-cchayaya

The reflection of the splendid beauty of the Lord is not attainable even by millions of Cupids, and with that splendour the Lord uproots the darkness of the ignorance of the age of Kali.  Descending with the principal demigods, the Lord delighted the eyes of the residents of this earth planet.  All glories to that effulgent Lord, the son of Saci-devi.

Text 7

He is like a golden mountain that scatters jewels of pure love of God.  Because of His great mercy He wandered on this earth planet.  That Lord, known as Visvambhara, the maintainer of the universe, inundated His own universe with the currents of the Ganges river of tears of love of Godhead flowing from His eyes.  All glories to that Lord, the son of Saci-devi.

Text 8

tadiya-rasa-carvanam vijayate saci-nandanah

Lord Krsna said to Uddhava: ‘What is the condition of Srimati Radharani now that I have come to Mathura?  Please tell me so that I may understand.’  In order to fulfil His own desire, Lord Krsna, the son of the king of Vraja, has descended as Lord Caitanya to taste the mellows of His own devotional service

Text 9

O Lord, O son of Saci-devi, O ocean of transcendental qualities, please place in Your abode all who read these eight verses and are full of faith in Your lotus feet.

“Svarupa Damodara, among these aspiring devotees you have not selected one worthy to explain the most exalted parakiya-rasa.”  With a glance the Lord then singled out the astonished Sanatana Gosvami.  May Lord Gauracandra eternally shine in my heart.

“Svarupa Damodara, I made the entire universe chant Lord Hari’s name.  Why can I not make this son of Sivananda Sena chant?”  By speaking these words the Lord transformed that child into a great poet.  May Lord Gauracandra eternally shine in my heart.

Text 5

“Svarupa Damodara, let the lotus-eyed gopis describe the nectar stream that flows in Vraja.  My ears yearn for that stream, which is born from intense jealous love.  Here is the jealous goddess of fortune!  Look!”  Speaking in this way, may Lord Gauracandra eternally shine in my heart.

Text 6
svarupa rasa-mandiram bhavasi man-mudam aspadam

“Svarupa Damodara, you are a temple of nectar!  You are the home of My happiness!  Here in Jagannatha Puri you are My Vraja!”  Speaking these words and embracing him, the Lord overwhelmed Svarupa Damodara, making the hairs of his body stand up in ecstasy.  May Lord Gauracandra eternally shine in my heart.

Text 7

“Svarupa Damodara, what did I see?”
“Where, my Lord?”
“In a dream at night.”
“Tell me, what was it, my Lord.”
“It was a youth that was a monsoon cloud.”
“What did He do?  Do You see Him now?”
“He has not left My sight.”
May Lord Gauracandra eternally shine in my heart.

Text 8

“Svarupa Damodara, why does smiling Krsna not come before My eyes?  O Friend, why does He not extend His hand to Me?”  Again and again He runs, stumbles, sighs, and trembles.  May Lord Gauracandra eternally shine in my heart.

Text 9

sri Svapna-vilasamrtastaka

yatha vrndaranye natana-patavas tatra bahavah
mrdangadyam vadyam vividham iha kascid dvija-manih
sa vidyud-gaurangah ksipati jagatim prema-jaladhau

Srimati Radharani said: Beloved, in a dream I saw a river shore like the Yamuna here.  There were many expert dancers as in Vrndavana.  There were mrdangas and other instruments.  There was a brahmana jewel as splendid as lightning who was tossing the universe into an ocean of pure love.

Text 2
kadacit krsneti pralapati rudan karhicid asau
kva radhe ha heti svasiti patati projjhati dhrtim
nataty ullasena kvacid api ganaih svaih pranayibhis
trnadi-brahmantam jagad atitaram rodayati sah

Sometimes He calls out: “O Krsna!”  and sometimes He sighs: “O Radha, where are You?”  Sometimes He falls to the ground, sometimes He acts wildly, losing all composure, and sometimes He dances ecstatically with His loving associates.  He has made all the residents of this world, from the blades of grass up to Lord Brahma, loudly call out the name of Krsna.

Text 3
tato buddhir bhranta mama samajani preksya kim aho

As I gazed at Him, My intelligence became bewildered.  If He is my lover, where am I?  If He is I, where is My lover?  If He is My lover, where am I?  As I slept, I became more and more bewildered.

Text 4
priye drstva tas tah kutukini maya darsita-cari

katham vipro vismapayitum asakat tvam tava katham
tatha bhrantim dhatte sa hi bhavati ko hanta kim idam

Sri Krsna said: O inquisitive girl, when I showed You Narayana and My other forms You were not surprised.  Why does this brahmana surprise You?  Why does He bewilder You so You say “Who is He?”

Text 5
iti procya prestham ksanam atha paramrsya ramano
hasann akuta jnam vyanudad atha tam kaustubha-manim
tatha diptim tene sapadi sa yatha drstim iti tad

After speaking these words to His beloved, the smiling lover, Krsna, touched His Kaustubha jewel.  The jewel, understanding the Lord’s intent, glowed and then showed all the same pastimes and all the moving and non moving entities She saw in her dream.

Text 6
vibhavyatha proce priyatama maya jnatam akhilam
tavakutam yat tvam smitam atanuthas tattvam asi mam
sphutam yan navadir yad abhimatir atrapy aham iti
sphuranti me tasmad aham api sa evety anumime

Srimati Radharani reflected for a moment and said: Beloved, I know what is in Your heart now that makes You smile.  You are He.  What You have said and thought is now clear to Me, and therefore I think I am also He.

Text 7

Making this Kaustubha jewel, which is so delightful to Us, shine in this way, You have revealed Yourself to all living entities.  By Your own transcendental potency You will appear, display Your pastimes, teach everyone, and again plunge the world into the ocean of pure love.

Text 8
yad uktam gargena vraja-pati-samaksam sruti-vida

In the king of Vraja’s presence, the learned Vedic scholar Gargacarya said that You will appear with a yellow complexion.  He did not lie.  This dream of Mine is true.  It is not an illusion.  In this dream I have directly seen You.

Text 9

If the bumble-bee of the reader’s mind drinks the nectar of this Svapna-vilasamrta, then that intelligent reader will quickly awaken from the dream of materialistic doubt.

May Nanda’s son, who is full of six opulences, who from His very birth was supremely opulent, who displayed supreme (2) strength by killing a multitude of demons, who became supremely (3) famous by protecting Arjuna, who manifested supreme (4) wealth at Dvaraka, the capitol of the Yadus, who spoke supreme transcendental (5) knowledge to Arjuna, and who exhibited supreme (6) renunciation in the Yadus’ fratricidal war, be pleased with me.

He possesses all fame because He gives liberation to His enemies, because although He took birth in human society, He defeated Siva and the other demigods, because He is submissive to the humble devotees who offer obeisances to Him, because He gave a benediction to Draupadi in the assembly, and because He was lavishly worshipped in the Rajasuya sacrifice.  May Nanda’s son be pleased with me.

Text 5

He gave to a dear friend the jewel Bhagavad-gita, which has no equal in the world.  With love He gave to Uddhava the ultimate truth of the Vedas.  He gave to the saintly gopis, who thought Him more dear than  life, the knowledge of the sweetest nectar.  May Nanda’s son, who possesses all knowledge, be pleased with me.

Text 7

He brought an offensive hunter to Vaikuntha in his own body.  He abandoned His own proud relatives, even though the sruti declares that they were already liberated and had eternal spiritual bodies.  May Nanda’s son, who possesses all renunciation, be pleased with me.

Although He is unborn, He takes birth.  Although He is affectionate, He is aloof from everything.  Although He enjoys pastimes, he is inactive.  He is both all-pervading and limited.  He possesses and does not possess ego and possessiveness.  May Nanda’s son, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is full of all opulences, be pleased with me.
