     1. His youthful golden form staggers in ecstasy. His moonlike face smiles with waves of nectar.
     2. His forest garland reaches to the ground. His sweet fragrance attracts swarms of bees.
     3. In one set of hands He holds a bow and sharp arrows. Seeing them His enemies tremble in fear.
     4. These arms are dark like dürvä grass. They have ornaments of claws. His jewel bracelets and anklets glisten.
     5. Below these is another pair of arms. These arms are dark like monsoon clouds. In these hands He plays peerless charming melodies on the flute.
     6. These nails defeat a host of jewel moons. Decorated with jewel ornaments they make Kämadeva faint in ecstasy.
     7. Below these is another pair of arms. In these hands He holds a daëòa and kamaëòalu. Into pieces these arms break Kali-yuga’s sins and offenses.
     8. A necklace of jewels and pearls sways to and fro on the mountain of His chest. A Kaustubha jewel sways to and fro on His chest marked with Çrévatsa.
     9. His sandal-paste-anointed arms rest at the edge of His chest. His navel is deep. His waist is slender like a lion’s waist.
     10. His garments reach to reddish feet. Ananta däsa worships the nails on His toes.
