Part 1 Viraha Astaka-Prayers in Separation From My Spiritual Master, December 1958

Song 1_The Flood of Krsna Prema

Text 1 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this anniversary of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Text 2 
"The ocean of mercy was previously held back by a dam, but Lord Nityananda personally cut a channel in it and thereby released the outpouring flood of pure ecstatic love of God. " (from Locana's dasa's  song Nitai Guna mani)

Text 3 
Those devotees to whom the responsiblity was given to continue spreading  this flood of love somehow became overpowered by Maya and were thus  reduced to simply performing ritualistic Hindu ceremonies for the benefit of the materialists.

Text 4 
Lord Nityananda's inundation of prema was thus completely stopped by those known as jati-gosai (caste gosvamis) But Then you personally came, O Master to open wide the floodgates once again.

Text 5 
Again you engulfed everyone in the deluge of pure divine love - even such a low, wretched, fallen and sinful soul as myself.

Text 6 
On the strength of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's command you sent all of your servants as spiritual masters, going from door to door, just to deliver the fallen souls.

Text 7 
The devotees were enthusiastically preaching everywhere - from the oceans to the Himalaya mountains, But now that you have gone from our midst everything today has become very dark.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 2_The Merciful Flood Has Been Stopped

Text 1 
Just as Advaita Prabhu had prayed fervently and thus induced Sri Gauranga to descend, so did your father, Bhaktivinoda Thakura, pray for you to incarnate.

Text 2 
Due to Bhaktivinoda's eagerness, O Master, you came and proclaimed to everyone that India is the most holy land of the Lord's divine pastimes.

Text 3 
"One who has taken birth in this land of Bharata-bhumi (India) should first make his own life successful and then work for the benefit of all other people" (C.C Adi 9.41)

Text 4 
This is the most significant message of Lord Caitanya that you boldly preached everywhere. But now in your absence, O Master, everything has fallen into darkness.

Text 5 
The overflowing ocean of your compassion has once again been dammed up. This makes me feel as if a spear of great misery has indeed pierced my heart.

Text 6 
Without Caitanya Mahaprabhu's message being spread there is only confusion and upheaval in the movement. Seeing this situation, all the Vaisnavas are also feeling overwhelmed with the pangs of your separation.

Text 7 
The spirit souls have once again been captured by Maya and plunged into absolute darkness. Desperately searching for relief, they are simply perishing in a fathomless ocean of anxiety.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 3_Practical Chanting and Preaching

Text 1 
You instructed everyone you met to chant the holy name of Lord Krsna. You showed the example of continually reciting the maha-mantra into their ears.

Text 2 
You empowered everyone with the qualification to further distribute that holy name But now, by the influence of Maya, there is only darkness on all sides.

Text 3 
The souls who are truly attached to worshiping the Lord always sing and dance in joyful sankirtana. Following in the footsteps of their spiritual master, they deliver the whole world.

Text 4 
But those who have no such qualification perform nirjana bhajana or so-called confidential worship in a solitary place. Thus acting whimsically, all of them actually remain absorbed in personal sense gratification.

Text 5 
[As stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam 10,33,30]: "An ordinary soul should never imitate the activities of the Supreme Lord, even in his mind." According to these instructions in devotional service, the unqualified imitators are ruined.

Text 6 
You preached "utility is the principle" - that is, one should act without attachment and use anything that is deemed appropriate in the devotional service of the Lord.

Text 7 
In such detached devotional service to Lord Krsna there would be a temple established in every house. But now just the opposite situation is apparent everywhere.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 4_The Essential Purport Neglected

Text 1 
Everything regarding material prosperity as well as mystic perfection is fully present in your transcendental message: "Because the residents of Vraja have life, therefore they engage in preaching work." (Dusta Mana verse)

Text 2 
The "resolute intelligence" ("vyavasayatmika buddhi") explained by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti [in his commentary to Bhagavad Gita 2.41] is now spoiled since your disciples have become ensnared in the bewildering noose of Maya.

Text 3 
Those disciples who were irresolute in performing devotional service according to your instructions have now divided your mission in many factions. It appears that the tigress of ambition for material names and fame has appeared and personally provoked this upheaval.

Text 4 
The essential purport of your message obviously did not enter their ears. O where will I get the strength to perform this hari-nama-sankirtana?

Text 5 
To chant the holy name of the Lord is the explicit command of my worshipful spiritual master. I could never honestly neglect that order.

Text 6 
Your greatest acclaim is that you propagated the topmost religious culture. Anyone who accepts the holy name from you becomes spiritually qualified.

Text 7 
If all those who attained this qualification were to go out and make disciples then the miserable conditioned souls would all be delivered from this world of birth and death.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 5_The Disciple's Empowerment is Lost

Text 1 
The greatest mantra of all, consisting of thirty-two letters, is:
 Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare
 Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare
 People who are possessed by gross foolishness refuse to chant it.

Text 2 
Your so-called disciple, the jackal named Ananta Vasudeva, disobeyed your final instructions to keep the mission united, and thereby created a scandalous fiasco. The result of this philosophical deviation is evident to this day as imitative sahajiyas are being worshiped as gurus in your temples.

Text 3 
Is there a single temple to be found where your instructions are still being followed? As it is said: "punar musiko bhava"- Everyone has "again become a mouse."

Text 4 
The lion's food has been stolen away by the deceptive tricks of the jackal. Now caught in Maya's mighty clutches everyone is reduced to wailing and weeping.

Text 5 
O Master! If your are merciful to us one again, then even though we are trapped here on the shores of the ocean of death, we will finally behold a change for the better.

Text 6 
Then once again we can blissfully remember the holy name of Krsna, and once again we will have firm faith in your "Vaikuntha messages."

Text 7 
Once again you will make us dance in the pure holy name of Krsna. Thus you will personally dispel all this confusion caused by Maya.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 6_The Preaching Mission is Scattered

Text 1 
"Continue dancing, singing and performing sankirtana in the association of devotees." ( C.C. Adi 7.9Text 2 
These words spoken by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are especially nectarine.

Text 2 
If we have complete faith in these instructions given by you, our spiritual master, then in the performance of sankirtana actual love for Krsna will be aroused in us.

Text 3 
Without love of God, our tiny intelligence only becomes entangled in the network of Maya's delusions. Because no one actually attained prema, now there has been great upheaval in your mission.

Text 4 
The whole world has become filled with impersonalists, and the Vaisnavas have given up the work of preaching that was entrusted unto them and have simply gone off to perform solitary worship.

Text 5 
The Vaisnava's were famous as "patita pavana" (deliverers of the falen) but now this title has fallen into disgrace. Countless numbers of your disciples have been forced to leave your movement.

Text 6 
At such an inauspicious time, O Master, what can be done to repair the damage that is done? The beautiful garden that you had so carefully planted is now parched and withered away.

Text 7 
O Master, please awaken some good intelligence in this insignificant disciple of yours so that my firm faith in your transcendental message may increase more and more.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 7_Distributing the Pure Devotional Process

Text 1 
The most magnanimous incarnation of the Lord is Sri Krsna Caitanya. Distributing the process of attaining love of God by chanting the holy names of Krsna, He thus blessed the entire universe.

Text 2 
O Master, you are the personification of the transcendental message of Lord Caitanya. You are the distributor of that message to every town and village.

Text 3 
You sent your devotees to preach in the faraway lands of the Western countries, and you personally traveled all over India, even to the South.

Text 4 
You preached the pure philosophy of Lord Gauranga in such a way that intelligent persons could understand. And you showed such great concern, O Master, in convincing all your adversaries!

Text 5 
Lord Gauranga used many tricks just to engage the conditioned souls in devotional service, and you have also understood how to use all those tricks perfectly well.

Text 6 
You understood time, place and circumstance, and utilized everything as a strategy for preaching. Although observing your activities with their very eyes. those who are blind like owls and other creatures of the night could not see your true purpose.

Text 7 
What will the Auls and the Sahajiyas and the other nonsense groups ever understand? And what will the sheep-like common people or dry logicians ever understand?

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Song 8_If Only You would Come Again

Text 1 
Lord Caitanya's method of devotional service is not performed in solitude. You preached this again and again to your own devotees.

Text 2 
Just as the Lord delivered Jagai and Madhai out of His own causeless mercy, you explained to everyone that this same method of preaching work has to go on.

Text 3 
The world has now filled up with many Jagais and Madhais to deliver. Everyone is anxiously looking down the road waiting for Caitanya-Nitai to come to their rescue.

Text 4 
If, at such a time as this, you were to personally return to this world and once more preach about all these things the way you always used to do.

Text 5 
If there were enthusiastic preaching activities again taking place in every direction, then all the people as before would be stirred up in blissful excitement.

Text 6 
Your profound shouting would cause the demons and atheists to flee, and your narrations of Lord Caitanya's message would fill the hearts of the innocent souls.

Text 7 
Again the whole world would be excitedly bustling with good tidings, but as it is, in your absence now there is nothing of value anywhere.

Text 8 
O Srila Prabhupada! You personally suffer to see the suffering of the fallen conditioned souls. On this day of your separation I am utterly despondent.

Text 9 
O Master! My heart is broken in your absence. This disciple named Abhay has hereby revealed only a small token of his wretched agony of separation.


Part 2 Vaisistya Astaka-Vrndavana, Radha Damodara, 1961

Song 1_First song

Text 1 
On that day, O my master, I made a cry of grief, I was not able to tolerate the absence of you, my guru.
Text 2 
On this auspicious day I have come with this offering just to worship you, remembering your lotus feet.
Text 3 
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s judgement is that renunciation is the most important thing. Not only that, but knowledge of such renunciation must be delivered to every living being.
Text 4
The beginner in devotional service has no ability to do this properly, but you are a maha-bhagavata. You have given us direction.
Text 5
If one is bewildered by ignorance, what kind of renunciant can he be? He will only be a phalgu-vairagi, renouncing externally.
Text 6
Renunciation is actually the result of real spiritual emotion. Without such feeling, it is simply known as “show-bottle.”
Text 7
But there is another show-bottle for the purpose of preaching.  That is the Lord’s sannyasa, by which the Mayavadis are converted.
Text 8
Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is beyond varnasrama. It is bhagavata-dharma and is meant for putting an end to all cheating processes of religion.
Text 9
In performing dry renunciation, there can be no real preaching. Therefore yukta-vairagya is given as the highest essential understanding.
Text 10
The sannyasa which you have given us is for preaching in devotion. The faithless sense enjoyers are not able to understand this.

Song 2_Second song

Text 1
Generally the sannyasis renounce everything and go to stay in mountain caves, but you, O master, keep your sannyasis in mansions of marble.
Text 2
To see a sense enjoyer is just like drinking poison, but you, O my master, go far and near, even abroad, to give them your darsana.
Text 3
Mlecchas and yavanas are forbidden to enter the Hindu temples, but you, my Lord, make them the chairman and sit them in the assembly of devotees.
Text 4
Hindus are not allowed to cross the ocean, but you send your devotees overseas to preach.
Text 5
In the cities of the Kali-yuga the instructions of bona fide spiritual preceptors are “forbidden,” still you remain there in any way possible.
Text 6
The devotees want to hide in a secluded place to perform their bhajana. You, however, do not accept this in your judgement.
Text 7
Wherever there is an increase in the population, in that place the preaching work is to be found.
Text 8
In London you want a student hostel. You explain that it must be very first class.
Text 9
In the land of barbarians, a student hostel for preaching hari-katha! Who can understand the significance of these things? 
Text 10
To resolve all these apparently contradictory statements is not the play of some incompetent fool.

Song 3_Third song

Text 1
If everyone simply sat down together and considered these things, then what nice preaching there could be!
Text 2
That is your order also, that everyone coming together should merge in your message and preach it to the world.
Text 3
If everyone simply imitates, then there will only be a contradictory result. As long as it goes on, there will only be failure.
Text 4
Even now, my Godbrothers, you return here in the order of our master, and together we engage in his puja. 
Text 5
But simply a festival of flowers and fruits does not constitute worship. The one who serves the message of the guru, really worships him.
Text 6
The service of the message is the real meaning of the Vedas. Don’t be proud, brothers. Come back to this.
Text 7
Kalidas Nag [a learned man who was defeated in debate by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and later became his disciple], that master said in public forum one day,
Text 8
That Kali’s mission was to kill all the entire world while the essential meaning of Lord Caitanya’s message was kept locked up in a cage.
Text 9
Oh, shame! My dear brothers, aren’t you embarrassed? In the manner of businessmen you increase your disciples.
Text 10
Our spiritual master said to preach! Let the neophytes remain inside the temples and simply ring the bells.

Song 4_Fourth song

Text 1
All these things are not our spiritual master’s preaching methods. These are all the things done by the caste gosvamis.
Text 2
But just take a good look at the terrible situation that has arisen. Everyone has become a sense enjoyer and has given up preaching.
Text 3
In the temples also they have begun to lock the doors. Preach this bhagavata-dharma, don’t hesitate.
Text 4
Whithin this world there is another world, whose sound is the unequaled penetrating force.
Text 5
The preaching that “the molla only goes as far as the mosque and no further” should be put to an end today.
Text 6
From the seas, across the earth, penetrate the universal shell, come together and preach this Krsna consciousness.
Text 7
Then our master’s service will be in proper order. Make your promise today. All of you get together and decide what should be done.
Text 8
You have become renouncers, brothers, so renounce everything. But if you also renounce the order of your spiritual master, then what kind of renunciation is that?
Text 9
The one who renounces his guru’s order (guru-tyagi) and the one who tries to enjoy the assets of his spiritual master (guru-bhogi) are two kinds of useless persons. First become a servant of your spiritual master (guru-sevi), and then you will understand all these things clearly.

Song 5_Fifth song

Text 1
If there is only one Supreme Lord, then a true sadhu, even if his wealth increases, gives up his desire for profit, adoration and prestige in this material world.
Text 2
Your gold, brother, is the father of sense gratification. This meaningful statement was spoken by Prabhupada himself. 
Text 3
Give up your wealth for preaching. Sit down together and make a special effort to come to a decision.
Text 4
The Supreme Lord says that everything is His. Don’t protest. Just unite and preach.
Text 5
Srila Prabhupada gave this final message himself. Jake great care to do that completely and in all respects.
Text 6
Otherwise your sannyasa will be wasted and useless. O saintly ones, be careful, otherwise afterward you will regret.
Text 7
So what is the difficulty for all of us to come together in this way? And why do all these things even have to be said to you?
Text 8
Give up your stubbornness, there is no time! Come, all my brothers, on this auspicious holy occasion.

Song 6_Sixth song

Text 1
When will that day come when there will be a temple established in every house in every corner of the world?
Text 2
When the high court judge will be a Gaudiya Vaisnava with tilaka beautifully decorating his forehead.
Text 3
When a Vaisnava winning votes will be elected president of the land, and preaching will be spread everywhere.
Text 4
The demons simply plunder the Lord’s wealth. The helpless populace cries “hey, hey” in distress.
Text 5
The demons want so many plans just to cheat the people. They sell sheat flour at thirty-two rupees a mound.
Text 6
Will opening a factory fill a hungry man’s belly? Being oppressed by starvation, they will eat grass and mango pits.
Text 7
Wearing a two paisa string, a man is called a brahmana. Wearing a saffron cloth, he has become a sannyasi.
Text 8
The householders beg from the sannyasis and why not? The sannyasis have tens of millions of rupees in the bank.
Text 9
As the days pass, the influence of Kali-yuga increases and the poor jivas are all crying in distress.
Text 10
Ten thousand cows are killed daily, and the nation’s expert leaders are all eating untouchable foodstuffs.
Text 11
People of muddy intelligence increase day by day. A man and his wife separate simply on a mere word.
Text 12
Everyone has become a witch by the influence of the age. Everyone is unhappy due to the absence of the mercy of the Vaisnavas.

Song 7_Seventh song

Text 1
The Vaisnavas are famous as para-duhkha-duhkhih. This fame will increase as the preaching increases.
Text 2
If eternally pure devotional service to Krsna is awakened in everyone, then Kali will flee, screaming, of his own accord.
Text 3
Praninam upakaraya: do work for the benefit of all living beings. This is Mahaprabhu’s teaching. This is the storehouse of happiness in this life and the next.
Text 4
So which work has fallen into your hands, gather together and do it.
Text 5
Vasudeva Datta said to the Lord, paying his obeisances: “Save all the living beings in the material world.
Text 6
“Give all their sins and sufferings to me, who am the lowest of all. In this way all the miseries of the suffering conditioned souls will end.”
Text 7
He was the best of Vaisnavas, para-duhkha-duhkhi. He knew that there is no real happiness in gratifying the senses.
Text 8
And what kind of mercy can the non-Vaisnava have? He simply makes offenses by his daridra-narayana philosophy.
Text 9
The mercy of the Vaisnavas is scientific and authorized. Without the Vaisnavas’ mercy, this world is simply insurmountable Maya.
Text 10
If there is a kingdom of Visnu and Vaisnavas on the surface of the earth, then the world will be happy. So say all the great sages and Rsis.

Song 8_Eighth song

Text 1
Why is everyone crying for Rama-rajya? The only way it can be had is if there is a Visnu-centered kingdom.
Text 2
Lord Krsna enthroned King Yudhisthira, then the whole world was rich and fortunate due to the qualities of a Vaisnava.
Text 3
The streams, rivers, trees, fields and mountains were all full of fruits and flowers. The milk-laden cows were floating in abundant milk.
Text 4
The birds, beasts and lower creatures were all non-envious. Material life in the Vaisnava kingdom was regulated and perfect.
Text 5
All immersed in bliss, sing the glories of Hari! The hearts if the Vaisnavas dance in ecstasy to see this.
Text 6
The entire world is filled with the use of material objects without a trace of devotion to the Lord.
Text 7
Still, they are searching after peace. Preach Krsna consciousness — fulfill their desires.
Text 8
Today, my brothers, get to this task. Save the battered souls by your preaching.
Text 9
Srila Prabhupada! Please be merciful today. This time have compassion. You are not a conditioned soul of this material world.
Text 10
Whatever independence one may have, let it be cast into the waters. The lowly Abhaya offers this presentation today.

How could I leave his service?” [Prahlāda Mahārāja to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, Bhāg. 7.9.28)

   It is said in the Srīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.2.17-21):
śrnvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ   punya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi   vidhunoti suhṛt satām
naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu   nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā
bhagavaty uttama-śloke   bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī
tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ   kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye
ceta etair anāviddhaṁ   sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati
evaṁ prasanna-manaso   bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ
bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ   mukta-saṅgasya jāyate
bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś   chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ
kṣīyante cāsya karmāṇi   dṛṣṭa evātmanīśvare

"Srī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted. By regular attendance in classes on the Bhāgavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed, and loving service unto the Personality of Godhead, who is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact. As soon as irrevocable loving service is established in the heart, the effects of nature's modes of passion and ignorance, such as lust, desire and hankering, disappear from the heart. Then the devotee is established in goodness, and he becomes completely happy. Thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness, the man whose mind has been enlivened by contact with devotional service to the Lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead in the stage of liberation from all material association. Thus the knot in the heart is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the self as master."

Who unfolds to me the loving pair

Let my mind fixed up in them

Narottama shall not be despair.
