om—O my Lord; namaù—offering my obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Personality of Godhead; väsudeväya—unto Väsudeva (the son of Vasudeva), or Lord Çré Kåñëa, the primeval Lord; janma-ädi—creation, sustenance and destruction; asya—of the manifested universes; yataù—from whom; anvayät—directly; itarataù—indirectly; ca—and; artheñu—purposes; abhijïaù—fully cognizant; sva-räö—fully independent; tene—imparted; brahma—the Vedic knowledge; hådä—consciousness of the heart; yaù—one who; ädi-kavaye—unto the original created being; muhyanti—are illusioned; yat—about whom; sürayaù—great sages and demigods; tejaù—fire; väri—water; mådäm—earth; yathä—as much as; vinimayaù—action and reaction; yatra—whereupon; tri-sargaù—three modes of creation, creative faculties; amåñä—almost factual; dhämnä—along with all transcendental paraphernalia; svena—self-sufficiently; sadä—always; nirasta—negation by absence; kuhakam—illusion; satyam—truth; param—absolute; dhémahi—I do meditate upon.

O my Lord, Çré Kåñëa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Çré Kåñëa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmäjé, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.

PURPORT
Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, directly indicate Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaké. This fact will be more explicitly explained later in the text of this work, when Çré Vyäsadeva directly asserts that Çré Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his Kåñëa-sandarbha. And Brahmä, the original living being, has explained the subject of Çré Kåñëa substantially in his treatise named Brahma-saàhitä. In an Upaniñad in the Säma-veda, it is also stated that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the divine son of Devaké. 
Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word Kåñëa, which means the all-attractive. In the Bhagavad-gétä, in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, who also cites great sages like Närada, Vyäsa, and many others. In the Padma Puräëa, it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name Kåñëa is the principal one. Although the name Väsudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and although all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with Väsudeva, are thus indicated in this text, the name Väsudeva particularly indicates Kåñëa, the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaké. Çré Kåñëa is always meditated upon by the paramahaàsas, who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.
Väsudeva, or Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mahäprabhu Çré Caitanya as the spotless Puräëa because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. The history of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also very glorious. It was compiled by Çré Vyäsadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of Çré Näradajé, his spiritual master. Vyäsadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the Vedas, the Vedänta-sütras (or the Brahma-sütras), the Puräëas, the Mahäbhärata, and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus Närada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord Çré Kåñëa. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Bhägavatam's Tenth Canto, which is considered its substance. But in order to reach the very substance one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.
It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord Çré Kåñëa is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist, who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.
In the Vedic literatures it is said that the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahmä, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahmä, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man's brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. Çréla Vyäsadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the parameçvara. He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the para or the parameçvara or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that parameçvara is Çré Kåñëa, as admitted in the Bhagavad-gétä and other scriptures delivered by Çré Vyäsadeva, and specifically in this Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In the Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that there is no other para-tattva (summum bonum) than Himself. Therefore, Çré Vyäsadeva at once worships the para-tattva, Çré Kåñëa, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.
Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto, and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord's räsa dance. This portion of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the most confidential part of this great literature. Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord's worshipable transcendental pastimes called räsa dance and His loving affairs with the gopés. This subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of paramahaàsa can transcendentally relish this räsa dance. Çréla Vyäsadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a Gäyatré mantra, dhémahi. This Gäyatré mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people. When one is successful in chanting the Gäyatré mantra, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra successfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord—His name, His fame, His qualities and so on.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the narration of the svarüpa of the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency, which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience. Çréla Vyäsadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this çloka. Çré Vyäsadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahmä, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia.
The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are apparently being carried out by demigods. Beginning from Brahmä down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the matter of material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent. He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth.
Conditioned souls, beginning from Brahmä, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them are independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self. This is called mäyä, or illusion. Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence. This is refuted in this çloka by Çréla Vyäsadeva: "Since the complete whole, or the Absolute Truth, is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth." Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.
In the çruti-mantra, it is also stated that the absolute whole, or Brahman, is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into Him. That is the law of nature. In the småti-mantra, the same is confirmed. It is said there that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahmä's millennium, and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth, or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literature, Brahmä is the creator of this universe. Yet he had to meditate to get inspiration for such creation. Therefore, neither Brahmä nor the sun is  the ultimate creator. It is stated in this çloka that Brahmä was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahmä, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahmä, in order that Brahmä could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. In the Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Çré Kåñëa states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy, prakåti, which constitutes the totality of matter. Therefore, Çré Vyäsadeva does not worship Brahmä, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahmä in his creative activities. 
In this çloka, the particular words abhijïaù and svaräö are significant. These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other living entity is either abhijïaù or svaräö. That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahmä has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even Mäyävädé impersonalists, who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord, are neither abhijïaù nor svaräö. Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like Rävaëa or Hiraëyakaçipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists, who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä in the well-known verse yadä yadä hi dharmasya gläniù. "Whenever there is a decline of dharma and a rise of adharma, O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself." (Bg. 4.7)
That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all çruti-mantras. It is said in the çruti-mantras that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God's further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God. But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually. Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is asamordhva, which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him. Paraà satyam, or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior. This is confirmed in the çruti-mantras. It is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone. That Lord instructed Brahmä in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä.
Unless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that he will be bewildered. When an intelligent man surrenders unto the lotus feet of Kåñëa and knows completely that Kåñëa is the cause of all causes, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä, then only can such an intelligent man become a mahätmä, or great soul. But such a great soul is rarely seen. Only the mahätmäs can understand that the Supreme Lord is the primeval cause of all creations. He is parama or ultimate truth because all other truths are relative to Him. He is omniscient. For Him, there is no illusion.
Some Mäyävädé scholars argue that Çrémad-Bhägavatam was not compiled by Çré Vyäsadeva. And some of them suggest that this book is a modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva. In order to refute such meaningless arguments, Çré Çrédhara Svämé points out that there is reference to the Bhägavatam in many of the oldest Puräëas. This first çloka of the Bhägavatam begins with the Gäyatré mantra. There is reference to this in the Matsya Puräëa, which is the oldest Puräëa. In that Puräëa it is said about the Bhägavatam that in it there are many narrations of spiritual instructions, that it begins with the Gäyatré mantra, and that it contains the history of Våträsura. Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full-moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the Bhägavatam in other Puräëas also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand çlokas. In the Padma Puräëa also there is reference to the Bhägavatam in a conversation between Gautama and Mahäräja Ambaréña. The king was advised therein to read regularly Çrémad-Bhägavatam if he desired liberation from material bondage. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the Bhägavatam. Within the past five hundred years, many erudite scholars and äcäryas like Jéva Gosvämé, Sanätana Gosvämé, Viçvanätha Cakravarté, Vallabhäcärya, and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya made elaborate commentaries on the Bhägavatam. And the serious student would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcendental messages.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura specifically deals with the original and pure sex psychology (ädi-rasa), devoid of all mundane inebriety. The whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life. In modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities. Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life.
This Çrémad-Bhägavatam will gradually elevate the unbiased reader to the highest perfectional stage of transcendence. It will enable him to transcend the three modes of material activities: fruitive actions, speculative philosophy, and worship of functional deities as inculcated in Vedic verses.
TEXT 2

dharmaù—religiosity; projjhita—completely rejected; kaitavaù—covered by fruitive intention; atra—herein; paramaù—the highest; nirmatsaräëäm—of the one-hundred-percent pure in heart; satäm—devotees; vedyam—understandable; västavam—factual; atra—herein; vastu—substance; çivadam—giving well-being; täpa-traya—threefold miseries; unmülanam—causing uprooting of; çrémat—beautiful; bhägavate—the Bhägavata Puräëa; mahä-muni—the great sage (Vyäsadeva); kåte—having compiled; kim—what is; vä—the need; paraiù—others; éçvaraù—the Supreme Lord; sadyaù—at once; hådi—within the heart; avarudhyate—becomes compact; atra—herein; kåtibhiù—by the pious men; çuçrüñubhiù—by culture; tat-kñaëät—without delay.

Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bhägavata Puräëa propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhägavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyäsadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of the Bhägavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.
PURPORT
Religion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, economic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from material bondage. Irreligious life is a barbarous condition. Indeed, human life begins when religion begins. Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are the four principles of animal life. These are common both to animals and to human beings. But religion is the extra function of the human being. Without religion, human life is no better than animal life. Therefore, in human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization and which makes reference to man's eternal relationship with God.
In the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition to lord it over the material nature, or, in other words, there is a continuous rivalry to satisfy the senses. Driven by such consciousness, man turns to religion. He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order to gain something material. But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion. Churches, mosques and temples are now practically vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord. Consequently, all these states are simply different types of sense gratification.
In the Vedas, the above-mentioned four activities are prescribed in the regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense gratification. But Çrémad-Bhägavatam is transcendental to all these sense-gratificatory activities. It is purely transcendental literature which can be understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord, who are transcendental to competitive sense gratification. In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead, where life is eternal and blissful. Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The contemporary socialist's conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator. From the point of view of the Vedas or from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are three paths mentioned in the Vedas. One involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets, another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him.
The impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest. Above the impersonal feature is the Paramätmä feature, and above this is the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, or Bhagavän. Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature. It is therefore higher than impersonal speculations and the jïäna-käëòa division of the Vedas, what to speak of the karma-käëòa division. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is even higher than the upäsanä-käëòa because it recommends the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, the divine son of Vasudeva. In the karma-käëòa, there is competition to reach heavenly planets for better sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the jïäna-käëòa and the upäsanä-käëòa. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam is superior to all of these because it aims at the Supreme Truth, which is the substance or the root of all categories. From Çrémad-Bhägavatam one can come to know the substance as well as the categories. The substance is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy.
Nothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies are different from the substance. This conception is not contradictory. Çrémad-Bhägavatam explicitly promulgates this simultaneously-one-and-different philosophy of the Vedänta-sütra, which begins with the "janmädy asya" [SB 1.1.1] sütra.
This knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators' attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously-one-and-different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are (1) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (2) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (3) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes, over which one has no control. Çrémad-Bhägavatam begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one's spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances.
Over and above this, Çrémad-Bhägavatam is a personal commentation on the Vedänta-sütra by Çré Vyäsadeva. It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of Närada. Çré Vyäsadeva is the authorized incarnation of Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is no question as to his authority. He is the author of all other Vedic literatures, yet he recommends the study of Çrémad-Bhägavatam above all others. In other Puräëas there are different methods set forth by which one can worship the demigods. But in the Bhägavatam only the Supreme Lord is mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body. Consequently, one who worships the Supreme Lord does not need to worship the demigods, because the Supreme Lord becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu has recommended the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as the spotless Puräëa and distinguished it from all other Puräëas.
The proper method for receiving this transcendental message is to hear it submissively. A challenging attitude cannot help one realize this transcendental message. One particular word is used herein for proper guidance. This word is çuçrüñu. One must be anxious to hear this transcendental message. The desire to sincerely hear is the first qualification.
Less fortunate persons are not at all interested in hearing this Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The process is simple, but the application is difficult. Unfortunate people find enough time to hear idle social and political conversations, but when invited to attend a meeting of devotees to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam they suddenly become reluctant, or they indulge in hearing the portion of the Bhägavatam they are unfit to hear. Sometimes professional readers of the Bhägavatam immediately plunge into the confidential topics of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, which they interpret as sex literature. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is meant to be heard from the beginning. Those who are fit to assimilate this work are mentioned in this çloka: "One becomes qualified to hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam after many pious deeds." The intelligent person, with thoughtful discretion, can be assured by the great sage Vyäsadeva that he can realize the Supreme Personality directly by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Without undergoing the different stages of realization set forth in the Vedas, one can be lifted immediately to the position of paramahaàsa simply by agreeing to receive this message.

O expert and thoughtful men, relish Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.

PURPORT
In the two previous çlokas it has been definitely proved that the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the sublime literature which surpasses all other Vedic scriptures due to its transcendental qualities. It is transcendental to all mundane activities and mundane knowledge. In this çloka it is stated that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is not only a superior literature but is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literatures. In other words, it is the cream of all Vedic knowledge. Considering all this, patient and submissive hearing is definitely essential. With great respect and attention, one should receive the message and lessons imparted by the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.
The Vedas are compared to the desire tree because they contain all things knowable by man. They deal with mundane necessities as well as spiritual realization. The Vedas contain regulative principles of knowledge covering social, political, religious, economic, military, medicinal, chemical, physical and metaphysical subject matter and all that may be necessary to keep the body and soul together. Above and beyond all this are specific directions for spiritual realization. Regulated knowledge involves a gradual raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual realization is knowledge that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all spiritual tastes, or rasas.
Every living entity, beginning from Brahmä, the first-born living being within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions. These sensual pleasures are technically called rasas. Such rasas are of different varieties. In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of rasas are enumerated: (1) raudra (anger), (2) adbhuta (wonder), (3) çåìgära (conjugal love), (4) häsya (comedy), (5) véra (chivalry), (6) dayä (mercy), (7) däsya (servitorship), (8) sakhya (fraternity), (9) bhayänaka (horror), (10) bébhatsa (shock), (11) çänta (neutrality), (12) vätsalya (parenthood).
The sum total of all these rasas is called affection or love. Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, parental affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the rasa is called conjugal love. But when such loving affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror. Sometimes loving affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes. Such rasas are displayed between man and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an exchange or rasa between a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living being within the material world. The rasas are exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the rasas were originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual exchange or rasa is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the çruti-mantras, Vedic hymns, as "the fountainhead of all rasas." When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one's constitutional rasa with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.
These çruti-mantras indicate that every living being has his constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of rasa to be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition only, this primary rasa is experienced in full. In the material existence, the rasa is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus the rasas of the material world are exhibited in the material form of raudra (anger) and so on.
Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different rasas, which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original rasas which are reflected in the material world. The learned scholar seeks to relish the real rasa in the spiritual form. In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different rasas.
In this çloka, it is definitely stated that spiritual rasa, which is relished even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam due to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge. By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can attain the full pleasure of his heart's desire. But one must be very careful to hear the message from the right source. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is exactly received from the right source because it was brought by Närada Muni from the spiritual world and given to his disciple Çré Vyäsadeva. The latter in turn delivered the message to his son Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, and Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé delivered the message to Mahäräja Parékñit during the seven days before the King's death. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was a liberated soul from his very birth. He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth. At birth no one is qualified, neither in the mundane nor in the spiritual sense. But Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization. Yet despite his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcendental rasa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is adored by liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns. The Supreme Lord's pastimes are more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people. He is of necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcendental rasa with a person.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons, including those who seek liberation to relish the humor of becoming one with the supreme whole.
In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as çuka. When a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the Bhägavatam exactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men.
The subject matter is so presented through the lips of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé that any sincere listener who hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of Kåñëaloka. Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance. Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental rasa, known as the räsa dance, without following in the footsteps of Çukadeva Gosvämé, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization. One should be intelligent enough to know the position of Çrémad-Bhägavatam by considering personalities like Çukadeva Gosvämé, who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession of the Bhägavata school suggests that in the future also, for all time, Çrémad-Bhägavatam has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the Bhägavatam illegally is certainly not a representative of Çukadeva Gosvämé. Such a man's business is only to earn his livelihood. Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men. Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They usually plunge into the subject matter of the räsa dance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé.
One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of rasa should receive the message of the Bhägavatam in the chain of disciplic succession from Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, who describes the Bhägavatam from its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of Çukadeva Gosvämé or his bona fide representative.

Song-2 Pranams to Srila Sukadeva Goswami &Others (SB I.2.2-4)
TEXT 2
süta uväca
yaà pravrajantam anupetam apeta-kåtyaà
dvaipäyano viraha-kätara äjuhäva
putreti tan-mayatayä taravo 'bhinedus
taà sarva-bhüta-hådayaà munim änato 'smi


sütaù—Süta Gosvämé; uväca—said; yam—whom; pravrajantam—while going away for the renounced order of life; anupetam—without being reformed by the sacred thread; apeta—not undergoing ceremonies; kåtyam—prescribed duties; dvaipäyanaù—Vyäsadeva; viraha—separation; kätaraù—being afraid of; äjuhäva—exclaimed; putra iti—O my son; tat-mayatayä—being absorbed in that way; taravaù—all the trees; abhineduù—responded; tam—unto him; sarva—all; bhüta—living entities; hådayam—heart; munim—sage; änataù asmi—offer obeisances.

Çréla Süta Gosvämé said: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that great sage [Çukadeva Gosvämé] who can enter the hearts of all. When he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sannyäsa], leaving home without undergoing reformation by the sacred thread or the ceremonies observed by the higher castes, his father, Vyäsadeva, fearing separation from him, cried out, "O my son!" Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.

PURPORT
The institution of varëa and äçrama prescribes many regulative duties to be observed by its followers. Such duties enjoin that a candidate willing to study the Vedas must approach a bona fide spiritual master and request acceptance as his disciple. The sacred thread is the sign of those who are competent to study the Vedas from the äcärya, or the bona fide spiritual master. Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé did not undergo such purificatory ceremonies because he was a liberated soul from his very birth.
Generally, a man is born as an ordinary being, and by the purificatory processes he is born for the second time. When he sees a new light and seeks direction for spiritual progress, he approaches a spiritual master for instruction in the Vedas. The spiritual master accepts only the sincere inquirer as his disciple and gives him the sacred thread. In this way a man becomes twice-born, or a dvija. After qualifying as a dvija one may study the Vedas, and after becoming well versed in the Vedas one becomes a vipra. A vipra, or a qualified brähmaëa, thus realizes the Absolute and makes further progress in spiritual life until he reaches the Vaiñëava stage. The Vaiñëava stage is the postgraduate status of a brähmaëa. A progressive brähmaëa must necessarily become a Vaiñëava, for a Vaiñëava is a self-realized, learned brähmaëa.
Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was a Vaiñëava from the beginning; therefore, there was no need for him to undergo all the processes of the varëäçrama institution. Ultimately the aim of varëäçrama-dharma is to turn a crude man into a pure devotee of the Lord, or a Vaiñëava. Anyone, therefore, who becomes a Vaiñëava accepted by the first-class Vaiñëava, or uttama-adhikäré Vaiñëava, is already considered a brähmaëa, regardless of his birth due to his past deeds. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted this principle and recognized Çréla Haridäsa Öhäkura as the äcärya of the holy name, although Öhäkura Haridäsa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusion, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was born a Vaiñëava, and, therefore, brahminism was included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any lowborn person—be he a Kiräta, Hüëa, Ändhra, Pulinda, Pulkaça, Äbhéra, Çumbha, Yavana, Khasa or even lower—can be delivered to the highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vaiñëavas. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was the instructing spiritual master of Çré Süta Gosvämé, who therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé before he begins his answers to the questions of the sages at Naimiñäraëya.
TEXT 3
yaù svänubhävam akhila-çruti-säram ekam
adhyätma-dépam atititérñatäà tamo 'ndham

yaù—he who; sva-anubhävam—self-assimilated (experienced); akhila—all around; çruti—the Vedas; säram—cream; ekam—the only one; adhyätma—transcendental; dépam—torchlight; atititérñatäm—desiring to overcome; tamaù andham—deeply dark material existence; saàsäriëäm—of the materialistic men; karuëayä—out of causeless mercy; äha—said; puräëa—supplement to the Vedas; guhyam—very confidential; tam—unto him; vyäsa-sünum—the son of Vyäsadeva; upayämi—let me offer my obeisances; gurum—the spiritual master; munénäm—of the great sages.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto him [Çuka], the spiritual master of all sages, the son of Vyäsadeva, who, out of his great compassion for those gross materialists who struggle to cross over the darkest regions of material existence, spoke this most confidential supplement to the cream of Vedic knowledge, after having personally assimilated it by experience.

PURPORT
In this prayer, Çréla Süta Gosvämé practically summarizes the complete introduction of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the natural supplementary commentary on the Vedänta-sütras. The Vedänta-sütras, or the Brahma-sütras, were compiled by Vyäsadeva with a view to presenting just the cream of Vedic knowledge. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the natural commentary on this cream. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé was a thoroughly realized master of the Vedänta-sütra, and consequently he also personally realized the commentary, Çrémad-Bhägavatam. And just to show his boundless mercy upon bewildered materialistic men who want to cross completely over nescience, he recited for the first time this confidential knowledge.
There is no point in arguing that a materialistic man can be happy. No materialistic creature—be he the great Brahmä or an insignificant ant—can be happy. Everyone tries to make a permanent plan for happiness, but everyone is baffled by the laws of material nature. Therefore the materialistic world is called the darkest region of God's creation. Yet the unhappy materialists can get out of it simply by desiring to get out. Unfortunately they are so foolish that they do not want to escape. Therefore they are compared to the camel, who relishes thorny twigs because he likes the taste of the twigs mixed with blood. He does not realize that it is his own blood and that his tongue is being cut by the thorns. Similarly, to the materialist his own blood is as sweet as honey, and although he is always harassed by his own material creations, he does not wish to escape. Such materialists are called karmés. Out of hundreds of thousands of karmés, only a few may feel tired of material engagement and desire to get out of the labyrinth. Such intelligent persons are called jïänés. The Vedänta-sütra is directed to such jïänés. But Çréla Vyäsadeva, being the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, could foresee the misuse of the Vedänta-sütra by unscrupulous men, and, therefore, he personally supplemented the Vedänta-sütra with the Bhägavata Puräëa. It is clearly said that this Bhägavatam is the original commentary on the Brahma-sütras. Çréla Vyäsadeva also instructed the Bhägavatam to his own son, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé, who was already at the liberated stage of transcendence. Çréla Çukadeva realized it personally and then explained it. By the mercy of Çréla Çukadeva, the Bhägavata-vedänta-sütra is available for all those sincere souls who want to get out of material existence.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the one unrivaled commentary on Vedänta-sütra. Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya intentionally did not touch it because he knew that the natural commentary would be difficult for him to surpass. He wrote his Çäréraka-bhäñya, and his so-called followers deprecated the Bhägavatam as some "new" presentation. One should not be misled by such propaganda directed against the Bhägavatam by the Mäyäväda school. From this introductory çloka, the beginning student should know that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the only transcendental literature meant for those who are paramahaàsas and completely freed from the material disease called malice. The Mäyävädés are envious of the Personality of Godhead despite Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya's admission that Näräyaëa, the Personality of Godhead, is above the material creation. The envious Mäyävädé cannot have access to the Bhägavatam, but those who are really anxious to get out of this material existence may take shelter of this Bhägavatam because it is uttered by the liberated Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. It is the transcendental torchlight by which one can see perfectly the transcendental Absolute Truth realized as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän.
TEXT 4
näräyaëaà namaskåtya
naraà caiva narottamam
devéà sarasvatéà vyäsaà
tato jayam udérayet


näräyaëam—the Personality of Godhead; namaù-kåtya—after offering respectful obeisances; naram ca eva—and Näräyaëa Åñi; nara-uttamam—the supermost human being; devém—the goddess; sarasvatém—the mistress of learning; vyäsam—Vyäsadeva; tataù—thereafter; jayam—all that is meant for conquering; udérayet—be announced.

Before reciting this Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is the very means of conquest, one should offer respectful obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, unto Nara-näräyaëa Åñi, the supermost human being, unto Mother Sarasvaté, the goddess of learning, and unto Çréla Vyäsadeva, the author.

PURPORT
All the Vedic literatures and the Puräëas are meant for conquering the darkest region of material existence. The living being is in the state of forgetfulness of his relation with God due to his being overly attracted to material sense gratification from time immemorial. His struggle for existence in the material world is perpetual, and it is not possible for him to get out of it by making plans. If he at all wants to conquer this perpetual struggle for existence, he must reestablish his eternal relation with God. And one who wants to adopt such remedial measures must take shelter of literatures such as the Vedas and the Puräëas. Foolish people say that the Puräëas have no connection with the Vedas. However, the Puräëas are supplementary explanations of the Vedas intended for different types of men. All men are not equal. There are men who are conducted by the mode of goodness, others who are under the mode of passion and others who are under the mode of ignorance. The Puräëas are so divided that any class of men can take advantage of them and gradually regain their lost position and get out of the hard struggle for existence. Çréla Süta Gosvämé shows the way of chanting the Puräëas. This may be followed by persons who aspire to be preachers of the Vedic literatures and the Puräëas. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the spotless Puräëa, and it is especially meant for those who desire to get out of the material entanglement permanently.

Song-3 Prayers by Arjuna to Lord Krishna (SB 1.7.22-26)

TEXT 22
arjuna uväca
kåñëa kåñëa mahä-bäho
bhaktänäm abhayaìkara
tvam eko dahyamänänäm
apavargo 'si saàsåteù


arjunaù uväca—Arjuna said; kåñëa—O Lord Kåñëa; kåñëa—O Lord Kåñëa; mahä-bäho—He who is the Almighty; bhaktänäm—of the devotees; abhayaìkara—eradicating the fears; tvam—You; ekaù—alone; dahyamänänäm—those who are suffering from; apavargaù—the path of liberation; asi—are; saàsåteù—in the midst of material miseries.

Arjuna said: O my Lord Çré Kåñëa, You are the almighty Personality of Godhead. There is no limit to Your different energies. Therefore only You are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of Your devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in You only.

PURPORT
Arjuna was aware of the transcendental qualities of Lord Çré Kåñëa, as he had already experienced them during the Kurukñetra War, in which both of them were present. Therefore, Arjuna's version of Lord Kåñëa is authoritative. Kåñëa is almighty and is especially the cause of fearlessness for the devotees. A devotee of the Lord is always fearless because of the protection given by the Lord. Material existence is something like a blazing fire in the forest, which can be extinguished by the mercy of the Lord Çré Kåñëa. The spiritual master is the mercy representative of the Lord. Therefore, a person burning in the flames of material existence may receive the rains of mercy of the Lord through the transparent medium of the self-realized spiritual master. The spiritual master, by his words, can penetrate into the heart of the suffering person and inject knowledge transcendental, which alone can extinguish the fire of material existence.
TEXT 23
tvam ädyaù puruñaù säkñäd
éçvaraù prakåteù paraù
mäyäà vyudasya cic-chaktyä
kaivalye sthita ätmani


tvam ädyaù—You are the original; puruñaù—the enjoying personality; säkñät—directly; éçvaraù—the controller; prakåteù—to material nature; paraù—transcendental; mäyäm—the material energy; vyudasya—one who has thrown aside; cit-çaktyä—by dint of internal potency; kaivalye—in pure eternal knowledge and bliss; sthitaù—placed; ätmani—own self.

You are the original Personality of Godhead, who expand Yourself all over the creations and are transcendental to material energy. You have cast away the effects of the material energy by dint of Your spiritual potency. You are always situated in eternal bliss and transcendental knowledge.

PURPORT
The Lord states in the Bhagavad-gétä that one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord can get release from the clutches of nescience. Kåñëa is just like the sun, and mäyä or material existence is just like darkness. Wherever there is the light of the sun, darkness or ignorance at once vanishes. The best means to get out of the world of ignorance is suggested here. The Lord is addressed herein as the original Personality of Godhead. From Him all other Personalities of Godhead expand. The all-pervasive Lord Viñëu is Lord Kåñëa's plenary portion or expansion. The Lord expands Himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings, along with His different energies. But Çré Kåñëa is the original primeval Lord, from whom everything emanates. The all-pervasive feature of the Lord experienced within the manifested world is also a partial representation of the Lord. Paramätmä, therefore, is included within Him. He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material manifestation because He is far above the material creation. Darkness is a perverse representation of the sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence of the sun, but in the sun proper there is no trace of darkness. As the sun is full of light only, similarly the Absolute Personality of Godhead, beyond the material existence, is full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also full of transcendental variegatedness. Transcendence is not at all static but is full of dynamic variegatedness. He is distinct from the material nature, which is complicated by the three modes of material nature. He is parama, or the chief. Therefore He is absolute. He has manifold energies, and through His diverse energies He creates, manifests, maintains and destroys the material world. In His own abode, however, everything is eternal and absolute. The world is conducted not by the energies or powerful agents by themselves, but by the potent all-powerful with all energies.
TEXT 24
sa eva jéva-lokasya
mäyä-mohita-cetasaù
vidhatse svena véryeëa
çreyo dharmädi-lakñaëam


saù—that Transcendence; eva—certainly; jéva-lokasya—of the conditioned living beings; mäyä-mohita—captivated by the illusory energy; cetasaù—by the heart; vidhatse—execute; svena—by Your own; véryeëa—influence; çreyaù—ultimate good; dharma-ädi—four principles of liberation; lakñaëam—characterized by.

And yet, though You are beyond the purview of the material energy, You execute the four principles of liberation characterized by religion and so on for the ultimate good of the conditioned souls.

PURPORT
The Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, out of His causeless mercy, descends to the manifested world without being influenced by the material modes of nature. He is eternally beyond the material manifestations. He descends out of His causeless mercy only to reclaim the fallen souls, who are captivated by the illusory energy. They are attacked by the material energy, and they want to enjoy her under false pretexts, although in essence the living entity is unable to enjoy. One is eternally the servitor of the Lord, and when he forgets this position he thinks of enjoying the material world, but factually he is in illusion. The Lord descends to eradicate this false sense of enjoyment and thus reclaim conditioned souls back to Godhead. That is the all-merciful nature of the Lord for the fallen souls.
TEXT 25
tathäyaà cävatäras te
bhuvo bhära-jihérñayä
svänäà cänanya-bhävänäm
anudhyänäya cäsakåt


tathä—thus; ayam—this; ca—and; avatäraù—incarnation; te—Your; bhuvaù—of the material world; bhära—burden; jihérñayä—for removing; svänäm—of the friends; ca ananya-bhävänäm—and of the exclusive devotees; anudhyänäya—for remembering constantly; ca—and; asakåt—repeatedly.

Thus You descend as an incarnation to remove the burden of the world and to benefit Your friends, especially those who are Your exclusive devotees and are constantly rapt in meditation upon You.

PURPORT
It appears that the Lord is partial to His devotees. Everyone is related with the Lord. He is equal to everyone, and yet He is more inclined to His own men and devotees. The Lord is everyone's father. No one can be His father, and yet no one can be His son. His devotees are His kinsmen, and His devotees are His relations. This is His transcendental pastime. It has nothing to do with mundane ideas of relations, fatherhood or anything like that. As mentioned above, the Lord is above the modes of material nature, and thus there is nothing mundane about His kinsmen and relations in devotional service.
TEXT 26
kim idaà svit kuto veti
deva-deva na vedmy aham

kim—what is; idam—this; svit—does it come; kutaù—wherefrom; vä iti—be either; deva-deva—O Lord of lords; na—not; vedmi—do I know; aham—I; sarvataù—all around; mukham—directions; äyäti—coming from; tejaù—effulgence; parama—very much; däruëam—dangerous.

O Lord of lords, how is it that this dangerous effulgence is spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand it.

PURPORT
Anything that is presented before the Personality of Godhead should be so done after due presentation of respectful prayers. That is the standard procedure, and Çré Arjuna, although an intimate friend of the Lord, is observing this method for general information.

Song-4 Prayers by Uttara (SB 1.8.9-10)

TEXT 9
uttaroväca
pähi pähi mahä-yogin
deva-deva jagat-pate
nänyaà tvad abhayaà paçye
yatra måtyuù parasparam


uttarä uväca—Uttarä said; pähi pähi—protect, protect; mahä-yogin—the greatest mystic; deva-deva—the worshipable of the worshiped; jagat-pate—O Lord of the universe; na—not; anyam—anyone else; tvat—than You; abhayam—fearlessness; paçye—do I see; yatra—where there is; måtyuù—death; parasparam—in the world of duality.

Uttarä said: O Lord of lords, Lord of the universe! You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me, protect me, for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality.
This material world is the world of duality, in contrast with the oneness of the absolute realm. The world of duality is composed of matter and spirit, whereas the absolute world is complete spirit without any tinge of the material qualities. In the dual world everyone is falsely trying to become the master of the world, whereas in the absolute world the Lord is the absolute Lord, and all others are His absolute servitors. In the world of duality everyone is envious of all others, and death is inevitable due to the dual existence of matter and spirit. The Lord is the only shelter of fearlessness for the surrendered soul. One cannot save himself from the cruel hands of death in the material world without having surrendered himself at the lotus feet of the Lord.
TEXT 10
abhidravati mäm éça
çaras taptäyaso vibho

abhidravati—coming towards; mäm—me; éça—O Lord; çaraù—the arrow; tapta—fiery; ayasaù—iron; vibho—O great one; kämam—desire; dahatu—let it burn; mäm—me; nätha—O protector; mä—not; me—my; garbhaù—embryo; nipätyatäm—be aborted.

O my Lord, You are all-powerful. A fiery iron arrow is coming towards me fast. My Lord, let it burn me personally, if You so desire, but please do not let it burn and abort my embryo. Please do me this favor, my Lord.

PURPORT
This incident took place after the death of Abhimanyu, the husband of Uttarä. Abhimanyu's widow, Uttarä, should have followed the path of her husband, but because she was pregnant, and Mahäräja Parékñit, a great devotee of the Lord, was lying in embryo, she was responsible for his protection. The mother of a child has a great responsibility in giving all protection to the child, and therefore Uttarä was not ashamed to express this frankly before Lord Kåñëa. Uttarä was the daughter of a great king, the wife of a great hero, and student of a great devotee, and later she was the mother of a good king also. She was fortunate in every respect.

Song-5 Prayers by Queen Kunti (SB 1.8.18-43)
TEXT 18
kunty uväca
namasye puruñaà tvädyam
éçvaraà prakåteù param
alakñyaà sarva-bhütänäm
antar bahir avasthitam


kunté uväca—Çrématé Kunté said; namasye—let me bow down; puruñam—the Supreme Person; tvä—You; ädyam—the original; éçvaram—the controller; prakåteù—of the material cosmos; param—beyond; alakñyam—the invisible; sarva—all; bhütänäm—of living beings; antaù—within; bahiù—without; avasthitam—existing.

Çrématé Kunté said: O Kåñëa, I offer my obeisances unto You because You are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of the material world. You are existing both within and without everything, yet You are invisible to all.

PURPORT
Çrématé Kuntédevé was quite aware that Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead, although He was playing the part of her nephew. Such an enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances unto her nephew. Therefore, she addressed Him as the original puruña beyond the material cosmos. Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible. The living entities are apt to fall down under the clutches of material nature, but the Lord is never like that. In the Vedas, therefore, He is described as the chief among all living entities (nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm [Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13]). Then again He is addressed as éçvara, or the controller. The living entities or the demigods like Indra, Candra and Sürya are also to some extent éçvara, but none of them is the supreme éçvara, or the ultimate controller. He is the parameçvara, or the Supersoul. He is both within and without. Although He was present before Çrématé Kunté as her nephew, He was also within her and everyone else. In the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15) the Lord says, "I am situated in everyone's heart, and only due to Me one remembers, forgets and is cognizant, etc. Through all the Vedas I am to be known because I am the compiler of the Vedas, and I am the teacher of the Vedänta." Queen Kunté affirms that the Lord, although both within and without all living beings, is still invisible. The Lord is, so to speak, a puzzle for the common man. Queen Kunté experienced personally that Lord Kåñëa was present before her, yet He entered within the womb of Uttarä to save her embryo from the attack of Açvatthämä's brahmästra. Kunté herself was puzzled about whether Çré Kåñëa is all-pervasive or localized. In fact, He is both, but He reserves the right of not being exposed to persons who are not surrendered souls. This checking curtain is called the mäyä energy of the Supreme Lord, and it controls the limited vision of the rebellious soul. It is explained as follows.
TEXT 19
mäyä-javanikäcchannam
ajïädhokñajam avyayam
na lakñyase müòha-dåçä
naöo näöyadharo yathä


mäyä—deluding; javanikä—curtain; äcchannam—covered by; ajïä—ignorant; adhokñajam—beyond the range of material conception (transcendental); avyayam—irreproachable; na—not; lakñyase—observed; müòha-dåçä—by the foolish observer; naöaù—artist; näöya-dharaù—dressed as a player; yathä—as.

Being beyond the range of limited sense perception, You are the eternally irreproachable factor covered by the curtain of deluding energy. You are invisible to the foolish observer, exactly as an actor dressed as a player is not recognized.

PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gétä Lord Çré Kåñëa affirms that less intelligent persons mistake Him to be an ordinary man like us, and thus they deride Him. The same is confirmed herein by Queen Kunté. The less intelligent persons are those who rebel against the authority of the Lord. Such persons are known as asuras. The asuras cannot recognize the Lord's authority. When the Lord Himself appears amongst us, as Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha or in His original form as Kåñëa, He performs many wonderful acts which are humanly impossible. As we shall find in the Tenth Canto of this great literature, Lord Çré Kåñëa exhibited His humanly impossible activities even from the days of His lying on the lap of His mother. He killed the Pütanä witch, although she smeared her breast with poison just to kill the Lord. The Lord sucked her breast like a natural baby, and He sucked out her very life also. Similarly, He lifted the Govardhana Hill just as a boy picks up a frog's umbrella and stood several days continuously just to give protection to the residents of Våndävana. These are some of the superhuman activities of the Lord described in the authoritative Vedic literatures like the Puräëas, Itihäsas (histories) and Upaniñads. He has delivered wonderful instructions in the shape of the Bhagavad-gétä. He has shown marvelous capacities as a hero, as a householder, as a teacher and as a renouncer. He is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such authoritative personalities as Vyäsa, Devala, Asita, Närada, Madhva, Çaìkara, Rämänuja, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Jéva Gosvämé, Viçvanätha Cakravarté, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté and all other authorities of the line. He Himself has declared as much in many places of the authentic literatures. And yet there is a class of men with demoniac mentality who are always reluctant to accept the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. This is partially due to their poor fund of knowledge and partially due to their stubborn obstinacy, which results from various misdeeds in the past and present. Such persons could not recognize Lord Çré Kåñëa even when He was present before them. 
Another difficulty is that those who depend more on their imperfect senses cannot realize Him as the Supreme Lord. Such persons are like the modern scientist. They want to know everything by their experimental knowledge. But it is not possible to know the Supreme Person by imperfect experimental knowledge. He is described herein as adhokñaja, or beyond the range of experimental knowledge. All our senses are imperfect. We claim to observe everything and anything, but we must admit that we can observe things under certain material conditions only, which are also beyond our control. The Lord is beyond the observation of sense perception. Queen Kunté accepts this deficiency of the conditioned soul, especially of the woman class, who are less intelligent. For less intelligent men there must be such things as temples, mosques or churches so that they may begin to recognize the authority of the Lord and hear about Him from authorities in such holy places. For less intelligent men, this beginning of spiritual life is essential, and only foolish men decry the establishment of such places of worship, which are required to raise the standard of spiritual attributes for the mass of people. For less intelligent persons, bowing down before the authority of the Lord, as generally done in the temples, mosques or churches, is as beneficial as it is for the advanced devotees to meditate upon Him by active service.
TEXT 20
tathä paramahaàsänäà
munénäm amalätmanäm
bhakti-yoga-vidhänärthaà
kathaà paçyema hi striyaù


tathä—besides that; paramahaàsänäm—of the advanced transcendentalists; munénäm—of the great philosophers or mental speculators; amala-ätmanäm—those whose minds are competent to discern between spirit and matter; bhakti-yoga—the science of devotional service; vidhäna-artham—for executing; katham—how; paçyema—can observe; hi—certainly; striyaù—women.

You Yourself descend to propagate the transcendental science of devotional service unto the hearts of the advanced transcendentalists and mental speculators, who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit. How, then, can we women know You perfectly?

PURPORT
Even the greatest philosophical speculators cannot have access to the region of the Lord. It is said in the Upaniñads that the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is beyond the range of the thinking power of the greatest philosopher. He is unknowable by great learning or by the greatest brain. He is knowable only by one who has His mercy. Others may go on thinking about Him for years together, yet He is unknowable. This very fact is corroborated by the Queen, who is playing the part of an innocent woman. Women in general are unable to speculate like philosophers, but they are blessed by the Lord because they believe at once in the superiority and almightiness of the Lord and thus offer obeisances without reservation. The Lord is so kind that He does not show special favor only to one who is a great philosopher. He knows the sincerity of purpose. For this reason only, women generally assemble in great numbers in any sort of religious function. In every country and in every sect of religion it appears that the women are more interested than the men. This simplicity of acceptance of the Lord's authority is more effective than showy insincere religious fervor.
TEXT 21
kåñëäya väsudeväya
devaké-nandanäya ca
nanda-gopa-kumäräya
govindäya namo namaù


kåñëäya—the Supreme Lord; väsudeväya—unto the son of Vasudeva; devaké-nandanäya—unto the son of Devaké; ca—and; nanda-gopa—Nanda and the cowherd men; kumäräya—unto their son; govindäya—unto the Personality of Godhead, who enlivens the cows and the senses; namaù—respectful obeisances; namaù—obeisances.

Let me therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has become the son of Vasudeva, the pleasure of Devaké, the boy of Nanda and the other cowherd men of Våndävana, and the enlivener of the cows and the senses.

PURPORT
The Lord, being thus unapproachable by any material assets, out of unbounded and causeless mercy descends to the earth as He is in order to show His special mercy upon His unalloyed devotees and to diminish the upsurges of the demoniac persons. Queen Kunté specifically adores the incarnation or descent of Lord Kåñëa above all other incarnations because in this particular incarnation He is more approachable. In the Räma incarnation He remained a king's son from His very childhood, but in the incarnation of Kåñëa, although He was the son of a king, He at once left the shelter of His real father and mother (King Vasudeva and Queen Devaké) just after His appearance and went to the lap of Yaçodämayé to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the blessed Vrajabhümi, which is very sanctified because of His childhood pastimes. Therefore Lord Kåñëa is more merciful than Lord Räma. He was undoubtedly very kind to Kunté's brother Vasudeva and the family. Had He not become the son of Vasudeva and Devaké, Queen Kunté could not claim Him to be her nephew and thus address Kåñëa in parental affection. But Nanda and Yaçodä are more fortunate because they could relish the Lord's childhood pastimes, which are more attractive than all other pastimes. There is no parallel to His childhood pastimes as exhibited at Vrajabhümi, which are replicas of His eternal affairs in the original Kåñëaloka, described as the cintämaëi-dhäma in the Brahma-saàhitä [Bs. 5.29]. Lord Çré Kåñëa descended Himself at Vrajabhümi with all His transcendental entourage and paraphernalia. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore confirmed that no one is as fortunate as the residents of Vrajabhümi, and specifically the cowherd girls, who dedicated their everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. His pastimes with Nanda and Yaçodä and His pastimes with the cowherd men and especially with the cowherd boys and the cows have caused Him to be known as Govinda. Lord Kåñëa as Govinda is more inclined to the brähmaëas and the cows, indicating thereby that human prosperity depends more on these two items, namely brahminical culture and cow protection. Lord Kåñëa is never satisfied where these are lacking.
TEXT 22
namaù paìkaja-näbhäya
namaù paìkaja-mäline

namaù—all respectful obeisances; paìkaja-näbhäya—unto the Lord who has a specific depression resembling a lotus flower in the center of His abdomen; namaù—obeisances; paìkaja-mäline—one who is always decorated with a garland of lotus flowers; namaù—obeisances; paìkaja-neträya—one whose glance is as cooling as a lotus flower; namaù te—respectful obeisances unto You; paìkaja-aìghraye—unto You, the soles of whose feet are engraved with lotus flowers (and who are therefore said to possess lotus feet).

My respectful obeisances are unto You, O Lord, whose abdomen is marked with a depression like a lotus flower, who are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, whose glance is as cool as the lotus, and whose feet are engraved with lotuses.

PURPORT
Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of the Personality of Godhead which distinguish His body from the bodies of all others. They are all special features of the body of the Lord. The Lord may appear as one of us, but He is always distinct by His specific bodily features. Çrématé Kunté claims herself unfit to see the Lord because of her being a woman. This is claimed because women, çüdras (the laborer class) and the dvija-bandhus, or the wretched descendants of the higher three classes, are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc., of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter into the spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see Him as the arcä-vigraha, who descends to the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls, including the above-mentioned women, çüdras and dvija-bandhus. Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matter, the Lord condescends to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who grows a lotus stem from the lotuslike depression in the center of His transcendental abdomen, and thus Brahmä, the first living being in the universe, is born. Therefore, the Lord is known as the Paìkajanäbhi. The Paìkajanäbhi Lord accepts the arcä-vigraha (His transcendental form) in different elements, namely a form within the mind, a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal, a form made of jewels, a form made of paint, a form drawn on sand, etc. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, and there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning attention of the nondevotees always engaged in material wranglings. The meditators worship a form within the mind. Therefore, the Lord is merciful even to the women, çüdras and dvija-bandhus, provided they agree to visit the temple of worship in different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolaters, as alleged by some men with a poor fund of knowledge. All the great äcäryas established such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent, and one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of the çüdras and the women or less. One should begin to see the Lord from His lotus feet, gradually rising to the thighs, waist, chest and face. One should not try to look at the face of the Lord without being accustomed to seeing the lotus feet of the Lord. Çrématé Kunté, because of her being the aunt of the Lord, did not begin to see the Lord from the lotus feet because the Lord might feel ashamed, and thus Kuntédevé, just to save a painful situation for the Lord, began to see the Lord just above His lotus feet, i.e., from the waist of the Lord, gradually rising to the face, and then down to the lotus feet. In the round, everything there is in order.

yathä håñékeça khalena devaké
kaàsena ruddhäticiraà çucärpitä
vimocitähaà ca sahätmajä vibho
tvayaiva näthena muhur vipad-gaëät


yathä—as it were; håñékeça—the master of the senses; khalena—by the envious; devaké—Devaké (the mother of Çré Kåñëa); kaàsena—by King Kaàsa; ruddhä—imprisoned; ati-ciram—for a long time; çuca-arpitä—distressed; vimocitä—released; aham ca—also myself; saha-ätma-jä—along with my children; vibho—O great one; tvayä eva—by Your Lordship; näthena—as the protector; muhuù—constantly; vipat-gaëät—from a series of dangers.

O Håñékeça, master of the senses and Lord of lords, You have released Your mother, Devaké, who was long imprisoned and distressed by the envious King Kaàsa, and me and my children from a series of constant dangers.

PURPORT
Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa and sister of King Kaàsa, was put into prison along with her husband, Vasudeva, because the envious King was afraid of being killed by Devaké's eighth son (Kåñëa). He killed all the sons of Devaké who were born before Kåñëa, but Kåñëa escaped the danger of child-slaughter because He was transferred to the house of Nanda Mahäräja, Lord Kåñëa's foster father. Kuntédevé, along with her children, was also saved from a series of dangers. But Kuntédevé was shown far more favor because Lord Kåñëa did not save the other children of Devaké, whereas He saved the children of Kuntédevé. This was done because Devaké's husband, Vasudeva, was living, whereas Kuntédevé was a widow, and there was none to help her except Kåñëa. The conclusion is that Kåñëa endows more favor to a devotee who is in greater dangers. Sometimes He puts His pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of helplessness the devotee becomes more attached to the Lord. The more the attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee.

viñät—from poison; mahä-agneù—from the great fire; puruña-ada—the man-eaters; darçanät—by combating; asat—vicious; sabhäyäù—assembly; vana-väsa—exiled to the forest; kåcchrataù—sufferings; mådhe mådhe—again and again in battle; aneka—many; mahä-ratha—great generals; astrataù—weapons; drauëi—the son of Droëäcärya; astrataù—from the weapon of; ca—and; äsma—indicating past tense; hare—O my Lord; abhirakñitäù—protected completely.

My dear Kåñëa, Your Lordship has protected us from a poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest and from the battle where great generals fought. And now You have saved us from the weapon of Açvatthämä.

PURPORT
The list of dangerous encounters is submitted herein. Devaké was once put into difficulty by her envious brother, otherwise she was well. But Kuntédevé and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for years and years together. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom, and each and every time the sons of Kunté were saved by the Lord. Once Bhéma was administered poison in a cake, once they were put into a house made of lac that was set afire, and once Draupadé was dragged into the vicious assembly of the Kurus and attempts were made to insult her by stripping her naked. The Lord saved Draupadé by supplying an immeasurable length of cloth, and Duryodhana's party failed to see her naked. Similarly, when they were exiled in the forest, Bhéma had to fight with the man-eater demon Hiòimba Räkñasa, but the Lord saved him. So it was not finished there. After all these tribulations, there was the great Battle of Kurukñetra, and Arjuna had to meet such great generals as Droëa, Bhéñma and Karëa, all powerful fighters. And at last, even when everything was done, there was the brahmästra released by the son of Droëäcärya to kill the child within the womb of Uttarä, and so the Lord saved the only surviving descendant of the Kurus, Mahäräja Parékñit.
TEXT 25

vipadaù—calamities; santu—let there be; täù—all; çaçvat—again and again; tatra—there; tatra—and there; jagat-guro—O Lord of the universe; bhavataù—Your; darçanam—meeting; yat—that which; syät—is; apunaù—not again; bhava-darçanam—seeing repetition of birth and death.

I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.

PURPORT
Generally those who are distressed, needy, intelligent or inquisitive and who have performed some pious activities worship or begin to worship the Lord. Others, who are thriving on misdeeds only, regardless of status, cannot approach the Supreme due to being misled by the illusory energy. Therefore, for a pious person, if there is some calamity there is no other alternative than to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord means preparing for liberation from birth and death. Therefore, even though there are so-called calamities, they are welcome because they give us an opportunity to remember the Lord, which means liberation.
One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are accepted as the most suitable boat for crossing the ocean of nescience, can achieve liberation as easily as one leaps over the holes made by the hoofs of a calf. Such persons are meant to reside in the abode of the Lord, and they have nothing to do with a place where there is danger in every step.
This material world is certified by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gétä as a dangerous place full of calamities. Less intelligent persons prepare plans to adjust to those calamities without knowing that the nature of this place is itself full of calamities. They have no information of the abode of the Lord, which is full of bliss and without trace of calamity. The duty of the sane person, therefore, is to be undisturbed by worldly calamities, which are sure to happen in all circumstances. Suffering all sorts of unavoidable misfortunes, one should make progress in spiritual realization because that is the mission of human life. The spirit soul is transcendental to all material calamities; therefore, the so-called calamities are called false. A man may see a tiger swallowing him in a dream, and he may cry for this calamity. Actually there is no tiger and there is no suffering; it is simply a case of dreams. In the same way, all calamities of life are said to be dreams. If someone is lucky enough to get in contact with the Lord by devotional service, it is all gain. Contact with the Lord by any one of the nine devotional services is always a forward step on the path going back to Godhead.
TEXT 26
janmaiçvarya-çruta-çrébhir

janma—birth; aiçvarya—opulence; çruta—education; çrébhiù—by the possession of beauty; edhamäna—progressively increasing; madaù—intoxication; pumän—the human being; na—never; eva—ever; arhati—deserves; abhidhätum—to address in feeling; vai—certainly; tväm—You; akiïcana-gocaram—one who is approached easily by the materially exhausted man.

My Lord, Your Lordship can easily be approached, but only by those who are materially exhausted, because one who is on the path of [material] progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot address You with sincere feeling.

PURPORT
Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, an education and attractive personal beauty. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. But the result is that by possessing all these material assets one becomes artificially puffed up, intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Consequently, such materially puffed up persons are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by addressing Him feelingly, "O Govinda, O Kåñëa." It is said in the çästras that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that he is unable to commit. Such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement. Actually the Lord's holy name has such powerful potency. But there is a quality to such utterances also. It depends on the quality of feeling. A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a man who utters the same holy name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. A materially puffed up person may utter the holy name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the name in quality. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement, namely (1) high parentage, (2) good wealth, (3) high education and (4) attractive beauty, are, so to speak, disqualifications for progress on the path of spiritual advancement. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. Sometimes it is seen that spiritually advanced persons become materially impoverished. This is no discouragement. On the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. The principle of life should be to decrease the degree of material intoxication, which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life. Grossly illusioned persons are quite unfit for entrance into the kingdom of God.
TEXT 27

My obeisances are unto You, who are the property of the materially impoverished. You have nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material modes of nature. You are self-satisfied, and therefore You are the most gentle and are master of the monists.

PURPORT
A living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. Therefore a living being cannot be, in the real sense of the term, a renouncer. A living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable. A student sacrifices his childish proclivities to gain better education. A servant gives up his job for a better job. Similarly, a devotee renounces the material world not for nothing but for something tangible in spiritual value. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, Sanätana Gosvämé and Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé and others gave up their worldly pomp and prosperity for the sake of the service of the Lord. They were big men in the worldly sense. Rüpa and Sanätana Gosvämés were ministers in the government service of Bengal, and Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé was the son of a big zamindar of his time. But they left everything to gain something superior to what they previously possessed. The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure house in the lotus feet of the Lord. There is a nice story about Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé. He had a touchstone with him, and this stone was left in a pile of refuse. A needy man took it, but later on wondered why the valuable stone was kept in such a neglected place. He therefore asked him for the most valuable thing, and then he was given the holy name of the Lord. Akiïcana means one who has nothing to give materially. A factual devotee, or mahätmä, does not give anything material to anyone because he has already left all material assets. He can, however, deliver the supreme asset, namely the Personality of Godhead, because He is the only property of a factual devotee. The touchstone of Sanätana Gosvämé, which was thrown in the rubbish, was not the property of the Gosvämé, otherwise it would not have been kept in such a place. This specific example is given for the neophyte devotees just to convince them that material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together. Unless one is able to see everything as spiritual in relation with the Supreme Lord, one must always distinguish between spirit and matter. A spiritual master like Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, although personally able to see everything as spiritual, set this example for us only because we have no such spiritual vision.
Advancement of material vision or material civilization is a great stumbling block for spiritual advancement. Such material advancement entangles the living being in the bondage of a material body, followed by all sorts of material miseries. Such material advancement is called anartha, or things not wanted. Actually this is so. In the present context of material advancement one uses lipstick at a cost of fifty cents, and there are so many unwanted things which are all products of the material conception of life. By diverting attention to so many unwanted things, human energy is spoiled without achievement of spiritual realization, the prime necessity of human life. The attempt to reach the moon is another example of spoiling energy, because even if the moon is reached, the problems of life will not be solved. The devotees of the Lord are called akiïcanas because they have practically no material assets. Such material assets are all products of the three modes of material nature. They foil spiritual energy, and thus the less we possess such products of material nature, the more we have a good chance for spiritual progress.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no direct connection with material activities. All His acts and deeds, which are exhibited even in this material world, are spiritual and thus unaffected by the modes of material nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that all His acts, even His appearance and disappearance in and out of the material world, are transcendental, and that one who knows this perfectly shall not take his birth again in this material world but will go back to Godhead.
The material disease is due to hankering after and lording it over material nature. This hankering is due to an interaction of the three modes of nature, and neither the Lord nor the devotees have attachment for such false enjoyment. Therefore, the Lord and the devotees are called nivåtta-guëa-våtti. The perfect nivåtta-guëa-våtti is the Supreme Lord because He never becomes attracted by the modes of material nature, whereas the living beings have such a tendency. Some of them are entrapped by the illusory attraction of material nature.
Because the Lord is the property of the devotees and the devotees are the property of the Lord reciprocally, the devotees are certainly transcendental to the modes of material nature. That is a natural conclusion. Such unalloyed devotees are distinct from the mixed devotees, who approach the Lord for mitigation of miseries and poverty or because of inquisitiveness and speculation. The unalloyed devotees and the Lord are transcendentally attached to one another. For others, the Lord has nothing to reciprocate, and therefore He is called ätmäräma, self-satisfied. Self-satisfied as He is, He is the master of all monists who seek to merge into the existence of the Lord. Such monists merge within the personal effulgence of the Lord called the brahma-jyoti, but the devotees enter into the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, which are never to be misunderstood as material.

My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. In distributing Your mercy, You are equal to everyone. The dissensions between living beings are due to social intercourse.

PURPORT
Kuntédevé knew that Kåñëa was neither her nephew nor an ordinary family member of her paternal house. She knew perfectly well that Kåñëa is the primeval Lord who lives in everyone's heart as the Supersoul, Paramätmä. Another name of the Paramätmä feature of the Lord is käla, or eternal time. Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Paramätmä is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything—past, present and future. And because the Paramätmä feature of Lord Kåñëa destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move. The living beings are given as much freedom as they deserve, and misuse of that freedom is the cause of suffering. The devotees of the Lord do not misuse their freedom, and therefore they are the good sons of the Lord. Others, who misuse freedom, are put into miseries destined by the eternal käla. The käla offers the conditioned souls both happiness and miseries. It is all predestined by eternal time. As we have miseries without calling for them, so we have happiness also without asking for it, because it is all predestined by käla. No one is therefore either an enemy or a friend of the Lord. Everyone is suffering and enjoying the result of his own destiny. This destiny is made by the living beings in course of social intercourse. Everyone here wants to lord it over the material nature, and thus everyone creates his own destiny under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. He is all-pervading and therefore He can see everyone's activities. And because the Lord has no beginning or end, He is known also as the eternal time, käla.

O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and so are misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.

PURPORT
The Lord's mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes appear to be exactly like a human being's, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sunrays, even stones sometimes become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun although there are profuse sunrays before him. Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sunrays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for something valuable. The pure devotee does not render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him. Suffering men, needy men, inquisitive persons and philosophers make temporary connections with the Lord to serve a particular purpose. When the purpose is served, there is no more relation with the Lord. A suffering man, if he is pious at all, prays to the Lord for his recovery. But as soon as the recovery is over, in most cases the suffering man no longer cares to keep any connection with the Lord. The mercy of the Lord is open for him, but he is reluctant to receive it. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a mixed devotee. Those who are completely against the service of the Lord are considered to be in abject darkness, those who ask for the Lord's favor only at the time of necessity are partial recipients of the mercy of the Lord, and those who are cent-per-cent engaged in the service of the Lord are full recipients of the mercy of the Lord. Such partiality in receiving the Lord's mercy is relative to the recipient, and it is not due to the partiality of the all-merciful Lord.
When the Lord descends to this material world by His all-merciful energy, He plays like a human being, and therefore it appears that the Lord is partial to His devotees only, but that is not a fact. Despite such apparent manifestation of partiality, His mercy is equally distributed. In the Battlefield of Kurukñetra all persons who died in the fight before the presence of the Lord got salvation without the necessary qualifications because death before the presence of the Lord purifies the passing soul from the effects of all sins, and therefore the dying man gets a place somewhere in the transcendental abode. Somehow or other if someone puts himself open in the sunrays, he is sure to get the requisite benefit both by heat and by ultraviolet rays. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is never partial. It is wrong for the people in general to think of Him as partial.
TEXT 30
janma karma ca viçvätmann
ajasyäkartur ätmanaù
tiryaì-nèñiñu yädaùsu
tad atyanta-viòambanam


janma—birth; karma—activity; ca—and; viçva-ätman—O soul of the universe; ajasya—of the unborn; akartuù—of the inactive; ätmanaù—of the vital energy; tiryak—animal; nå—human being; åñiñu—in the sages; yädaùsu—in the water; tat—that; atyanta—very; viòambanam—bewildering.

Of course it is bewildering, O soul of the universe, that You work though You are inactive, and that You take birth though You are the vital force and the unborn. You Yourself descend amongst animals, men, sages and aquatics. This is very bewildering.

PURPORT
The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are not only bewildering but also apparently contradictory. In other words, they are all inconceivable to the limited thinking power of the human being. The Lord is the all-pervading Supersoul of all existence, and yet He appears in the form of a boar amongst the animals, in the form of a human being as Räma, Kåñëa, etc., in the form of a åñi like Näräyaëa, and in the form of an aquatic like a fish. Yet it is said that He is unborn and He has nothing to do. In the çruti-mantra it is said that the Supreme Brahman has nothing to do, no one is equal to or greater than Him, He has manifold energies, and everything is performed by Him perfectly by automatic knowledge, strength and activity. All these statements prove without any question that the Lord's activities, forms and deeds are all inconceivable to our limited thinking power, and because He is inconceivably powerful, everything is possible in Him. Therefore no one can calculate Him exactly; every action of the Lord is bewildering to the common man. He cannot be understood by the Vedic knowledge, but He can be easily understood by the pure devotees because they are intimately related with Him. The devotees therefore know for certain that although He appears amongst the animals He is not an animal, and that He is also not a man or a åñi or a fish. He is eternally the Supreme Lord, in all circumstances.

gopé—the cowherd lady (Yaçodä); ädade—took up; tvayi—on Your; kåta-ägasi—creating disturbances (by breaking the butter pot); däma—rope; tävat—at that time; yä—that which; te—Your; daçä—situation; açru-kalila—overflooded with tears; aïjana—ointment; sambhrama—perturbed; akñam—eyes; vaktram—face; ninéya—downwards; bhaya-bhävanayä—by thoughts of fear; sthitasya—of the situation; sä—that; mäm—me; vimohayati—bewilders; bhéù api—even fear personified; yat—whom; bibheti—is afraid.

My dear Kåñëa, Yaçodä took up a rope to bind You when You committed an offense, and Your perturbed eyes overflooded with tears, which washed the mascara from Your eyes. And You were afraid, though fear personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.

PURPORT
Here is another example of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme in all circumstances, as already explained. Here is a specific example of the Lord's being the Supreme and at the same time a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee. The Lord's pure devotee renders service unto the Lord out of unalloyed love only, and while discharging such devotional service the pure devotee forgets the position of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord also accepts the loving service of His devotees more relishably when the service is rendered spontaneously out of pure affection, without anything of reverential admiration. Generally the Lord is worshiped by the devotees in a reverential attitude, but the Lord is meticulously pleased when the devotee, out of pure affection and love, considers the Lord to be less important than himself. The Lord's pastimes in the original abode of Goloka Våndävana are exchanged in that spirit. The friends of Kåñëa consider Him one of them. They do not consider Him to be of reverential importance. The parents of the Lord (who are all pure devotees) consider Him a child only. The Lord accepts the chastisements of the parents more cheerfully than the prayers of the Vedic hymns. Similarly, He accepts the reproaches of His fiancees more palatably than the Vedic hymns. 
When Lord Kåñëa was present in this material world to manifest His eternal pastimes of the transcendental realm of Goloka Våndävana as an attraction for the people in general, He displayed a unique picture of subordination before His foster mother, Yaçodä. The Lord, in His naturally childish playful activities, used to spoil the stocked butter of Mother Yaçodä by breaking the pots and distributing the contents to His friends and playmates, including the celebrated monkeys of Våndävana, who took advantage of the Lord's munificence. Mother Yaçodä saw this, and out of her pure love she wanted to make a show of punishment for her transcendental child. She took a rope and threatened the Lord that she would tie Him up, as is generally done in the ordinary household. Seeing the rope in the hands of Mother Yaçodä, the Lord bowed down His head and began to weep just like a child, and tears rolled down His cheeks, washing off the black ointment smeared about His beautiful eyes. This picture of the Lord is adored by Kuntédevé because she is conscious of the Lord's supreme position. He is feared often by fear personified, yet He is afraid of His mother, who wanted to punish Him just in an ordinary manner. Kunté was conscious of the exalted position of Kåñëa, whereas Yaçodä was not. Therefore Yaçodä's position was more exalted than Kunté's. Mother Yaçodä got the Lord as her child, and the Lord made her forget altogether that her child was the Lord Himself. If Mother Yaçodä had been conscious of the exalted position of the Lord, she would certainly have hesitated to punish the Lord. But she was made to forget this situation because the Lord wanted to make a complete gesture of childishness before the affectionate Yaçodä. This exchange of love between the mother and the son was performed in a natural way, and Kunté, remembering the scene, was bewildered, and she could do nothing but praise the transcendental maternal and filial love. Indirectly Mother Yaçodä is praised for her unique position of love, for she could control even the all-powerful Lord as her beloved child.
TEXT 32
kecid ähur ajaà jätaà
puëya-çlokasya kértaye
yadoù priyasyänvaväye
malayasyeva candanam


kecit—someone; ähuù—says; ajam—the Unborn; jätam—being born; puëya-çlokasya—of the great pious king; kértaye—for glorifying; yadoù—of King Yadu; priyasya—of the dear; anvaväye—in the family of; malayasya—Malaya Hills; iva—as; candanam—sandalwood.

Some say that the Unborn has taken birth for the glorification of the great pious king, and others say that You took birth to please King Yadu, one of Your dearest devotees. You appeared in his family as sandalwood appears in the Malaya Hills.

PURPORT
Because the Lord's appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about the birth of the Unborn. In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that He takes His birth in the material world although He is the Lord of all creations and He is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the Unborn, because He Himself establishes the truth. But still there are different opinions as to why He takes His birth. That is also declared in the Bhagavad-gétä. He appears by His own internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion and to protect the pious and to annihilate the impious. That is the mission of the appearance of the Unborn. Still, it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious King Yudhiñöhira. Lord Çré Kåñëa certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the Päëòavas for the good of all in the world. When there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. When the ruler is impious, the people are unhappy. In the Age of Kali in most cases the rulers are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. But in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them, and therefore they cannot blame anyone for their unhappiness. Mahäräja Nala was also celebrated as a great pious king (puëya-çloka), but he had no connection with Lord Kåñëa. Therefore here puëya-çloka means Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, who was glorified by Lord Kåñëa. Kåñëa had also glorified King Yadu, having taken His birth in the family of that king. Thus Kåñëa is known as Yädava, Yaduvéra, Yadunandana, etc., although the Lord is always independent of such obligation. He is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya Hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of the Malaya Hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya Hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya Hills are interrelated. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun and yet He appears in this material world in the same way that the sun rises on the eastern horizon. As the sun is never the son of the eastern horizon, so the Lord is no one's son but is the father of everything that be.

Others say that since both Vasudeva and Devaké prayed for You, You have taken Your birth as their son. Undoubtedly You are unborn, yet You took Your birth for their welfare and to kill those who are envious of the demigods.

PURPORT
It is also said that Vasudeva and Devaké, in their previous birth as Sutapä and Påçni, underwent a severe type of penance to get the Lord as their son, and as a result of such austerities the Lord appeared as their son. It is already declared in the Bhagavad-gétä that the Lord appears for the welfare of all people of the world and to vanquish the asuras, or the materialistic atheists.

bhära-avatäraëäya—just to reduce the burden of the world; anye—others; bhuvaù—of the world; nävaù—boat; iva—like; udadhau—on the sea; sédantyäù—aggrieved; bhüri—extremely; bhäreëa—by the burden; jätaù—You were born; hi—certainly; ätma-bhuvä—by Brahmä; arthitaù—being prayed for.

Others say that the world, being overburdened like a boat at sea, was much aggrieved, and that Brahmä, who is Your son, prayed for You, and so You have appeared in order to diminish the trouble.

PURPORT
Brahmä, or the first living being born just after the creation, is the direct son of Näräyaëa. Näräyaëa, as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, first of all entered the material universe. Without spiritual contact, matter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The Supreme Spirit entered the universe, and the first living being, Brahmä, was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Viñëu. Viñëu is therefore known as Padmanäbha. Brahmä is known as ätma-bhü because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lakñméjé. Lakñméjé was present near Näräyaëa, engaged in the service of the Lord, and still, without contact with Lakñméjé, Näräyaëa begot Brahmä. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who foolishly considers Näräyaëa like other living beings should take a lesson from this. Näräyaëa is not an ordinary living being. He is the Personality of Godhead Himself, and He has all the potencies of all the senses in all parts of His transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no means of begetting a child  other than the one designed for him. But Näräyaëa, being omnipotent, is not bound to any condition of energy. He is complete and independent to do anything and everything by His various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Brahmä is therefore directly the son of the father and was not put into the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as ätma-bhü. This Brahmä is in charge of further creations in the universe, secondarily reflected by the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the universe there is a transcendental planet known as Çvetadvépa, which is the abode of the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Paramätmä feature of the Supreme Lord. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahmäjé for a solution, and if it is not to be solved even by Brahmäjé, then Brahmäjé consults and prays to the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu for an incarnation and solution to the problem. Such a problem arose when Kaàsa and others were ruling over the earth and the earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the asuras. Brahmäjé, along with other demigods, prayed at the shore of the Kñérodaka Ocean, and they were advised of the descent of Kåñëa as the son of Vasudeva and Devaké. So some people say that the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahmäjé.

And yet others say that You appeared in order to renovate the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshiping and so on in order that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take advantage and gain liberation.

PURPORT
In the Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä the Lord asserts that He appears in every millennium just to reestablish the way of religion. The way of religion is made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of religion, as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as the supreme authority and thus render service unto Him in spontaneous love. A living being cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. The only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord. The Lord is great, and living beings are subordinate to Him. Therefore, the duty of the living being is just to serve Him only. Unfortunately the illusioned living beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses by material desire. This desire is called avidyä, or nescience. And out of such illegitimate desire the living being makes different plans for material enjoyment centered about a perverted sex life. He therefore becomes entangled in the chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies on different planets under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Unless, therefore, one is beyond the boundary of this nescience, one cannot get free from the threefold miseries of material life. That is the law of nature.
The Lord, however, out of His causeless mercy, because He is more merciful to the suffering living beings than they can expect, appears before them and renovates the principles of devotional service, comprised of hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, cooperating and surrendering unto Him. Adoption of all the above-mentioned items, or any one of them, can help a conditioned soul get out of the tangle of nescience and thus become liberated from all material sufferings created by the living being illusioned by the external energy. This particular type of mercy is bestowed upon the living being by the Lord in the form of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu.

O Kåñëa, those who continuously hear, chant and repeat Your transcendental activities, or take pleasure in others' doing so, certainly see Your lotus feet, which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa cannot be seen by our present conditional vision. In order to see Him, one has to change his present vision by developing a different condition of life full of spontaneous love of Godhead. When Çré Kåñëa was personally present on the face of the globe, not everyone could see Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Materialists like Rävaëa, Hiraëyakaçipu, Kaàsa, Jaräsandha and Çiçupäla were highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets, but they were unable to appreciate the presence of the Lord. Therefore, even though the Lord may be present before our eyes, it is not possible to see Him unless we have the necessary vision. This necessary qualification is developed by the process of devotional service only, beginning with hearing about the Lord from the right sources. The Bhagavad-gétä is one of the popular literatures which are generally heard, chanted, repeated, etc., by the people in general, but in spite of such hearing, etc., sometimes it is experienced that the performer of such devotional service does not see the Lord face to face. The reason is that the first item, çravaëa, is very important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly. Generally people hear from unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized persons may be very learned by academic qualifications, but because they do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them becomes a sheer waste of time. Sometimes they fashionably interpret the texts to suit their own purposes. Therefore, first one should select a competent and bona fide speaker and then hear from him. When the hearing process is perfect and complete, the other processes become automatically perfect in their own way.
There are different transcendental activities of the Lord, and each and every one of them is competent to bestow the desired result, provided the hearing process is perfect. In the Bhägavatam the activities of the Lord begin from His dealings with the Päëòavas. There are many other pastimes of the Lord in connection with His dealings with the asuras and others. And in the Tenth Canto the sublime dealings with His conjugal associates, the gopés and His married wives at Dvärakä, are mentioned. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference in the transcendental nature of each and every dealing of the Lord. But sometimes people, in an unauthorized hearing process, take more interest in hearing about His dealings with the gopés. Such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of the hearer, so a bona fide speaker of the dealings of the Lord never indulges in such hearings. One must hear about the Lord from the very beginning, as in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam or any other scriptures, and that will help the hearer attain perfection by progressive development. One should not, therefore, consider that His dealings with the Päëòavas are less important than His dealings with the gopés. We must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to all mundane attachment. In all the above-mentioned dealings of the Lord, He is the hero in all circumstances, and hearing about Him or about His devotees or combatants is conducive to spiritual life. It is said that the Vedas and Puräëas, etc., are all made to revive our lost relation with Him. Hearing all these scriptures is essential.

O my Lord, You have executed all duties Yourself. Are You leaving us today, though we are completely dependent on Your mercy and have no one else to protect us, now when all kings are at enmity with us?

PURPORT
The Päëòavas are most fortunate because with all good luck they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune, but in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything. But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of the laws of nature. Beginning from Rävaëa, who wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the planets of heaven, down to the people of the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power. But the highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Lord and become completely dependent on Him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor but at the same time depend completely on the Lord. The Päëòavas were the ideal executors of this standard of civilization. Undoubtedly they were completely dependent on the good will of Lord Çré Kåñëa, but they were not idle parasites of the Lord. They were all highly qualified, both by personal character and by physical activities. Still they always looked for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position. The perfection of life is, therefore, to become dependent on the will of the Lord instead of becoming falsely independent in the material world. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called anätha, or without any guardian, whereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called sanätha, or those having someone to protect them. Therefore we must try to be sanätha so that we can always be protected from the unfavorable condition of material existence. By the deluding power of the external material nature we forget that the material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. The Bhagavad-gétä (7.19) therefore directs us that after many, many births a fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that Väsudeva is all in all and that the best way of leading one's life is to surrender unto Him completely. That is the sign of a mahätmä. All the members of the Päëòava family were mahätmäs in household life. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira was the head of these mahätmäs, and Queen Kuntédevé was the mother. The lessons of the Bhagavad-gétä and all the Puräëas, specifically the Bhägavata Puräëa, are therefore inevitably connected with the history of the Päëòava mahätmäs. For them, separation from the Lord was just like the separation of a fish from water. Çrématé Kuntédevé, therefore, felt such separation like a thunderbolt, and the whole prayer of the Queen is to try to persuade the Lord to stay with them. After the Battle of Kurukñetra, although the inimical kings were killed, their sons and grandsons were still there to deal with the Päëòavas. It is not only the Päëòavas who were put into the condition of enmity, but all of us are always in such a condition, and the best way of living is to become completely dependent on the will of the Lord and thereby overcome all difficulties of material existence.

As the name and fame of a particular body is finished with the disappearance of the living spirit, similarly if You do not look upon us, all our fame and activities, along with the Päëòavas and Yadus, will end at once. 

PURPORT
Kuntédevé is quite aware that the existence of the Päëòavas is due to Çré Kåñëa only. The Päëòavas are undoubtedly well established in name and fame and are guided by the great King Yudhiñöhira, who is morality personified, and the Yadus are undoubtedly great allies, but without the guidance of Lord Kåñëa all of them are nonentities, as much as the senses of the body are useless without the guidance of consciousness. No one should be proud of his prestige, power and fame without being guided by the favor of the Supreme Lord. The living beings are always dependent, and the ultimate dependable object is the Lord Himself. We may, therefore, invent by our advancement of material knowledge all sorts of counteracting material resources, but without being guided by the Lord all such inventions end in fiasco, however strong and stout the reactionary elements may be.

O Gadädhara [Kåñëa], our kingdom is now being marked by the impressions of Your feet, and therefore it appears beautiful. But when You leave, it will no longer be so.

PURPORT
There are certain particular marks on the feet of the Lord which distinguish the Lord from others. The marks of the flag, thunderbolt, instrument for driving an elephant, umbrella, lotus, disc, etc., are on the bottom of the Lord's feet. These marks are impressed upon the soft dust of the land where the Lord traverses. The land of Hastinäpura was thus marked while Lord Çré Kåñëa was there with the Päëòavas, and the kingdom of the Päëòavas thus flourished by such auspicious signs. Kuntédevé pointed out these distinguishing features and was afraid of ill luck in the absence of the Lord.

All these cities and villages are flourishing in all respects because the herbs and grains are in abundance, the trees are full of fruits, the rivers are flowing, the hills are full of minerals, and the oceans are full of wealth. And this is all due to Your glancing over them. 

PURPORT
Human prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises. The gigantic industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilization, and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in general, although a few only can live lavishly by exploitation. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables, fruits, rivers, the hills full of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supreme, and as He desires, material nature produces them in abundance or restricts them at times. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts of nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the exploitative motive of lording it over material nature. The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables and herbs, then what is the necessity of running a slaughterhouse and killing poor animals? A man need not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fields, and there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hills, and the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk, etc., then why should it hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men? But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need, therefore, is to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve the perfection of human life by devotional service. The indications by Kuntédevé are just to the point. She desires that God's mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity be maintained by His grace.

O Lord of the universe, soul of the universe, O personality of the form of the universe, please, therefore, sever my tie of affection for my kinsmen, the Päëòavas and the Våñëis.

PURPORT
A pure devotee of the Lord is ashamed to ask anything in self-interest from the Lord. But the householders are sometimes obliged to ask favors from the Lord, being bound by the tie of family affection. Çrématé Kuntédevé was conscious of this fact, and therefore she prayed to the Lord to cut off her affectionate tie to her own kinsmen, the Päëòavas and the Våñëis. The Päëòavas are her own sons, and the Våñëis are the members of her paternal family. Kåñëa was equally related to both the families. Both the families required the Lord's help because both were dependent devotees of the Lord. Çrématé Kuntédevé wished Çré Kåñëa to remain with her sons the Päëòavas, but by His doing so her paternal house would be bereft of the benefit. All these partialities troubled the mind of Kunté, and therefore she desired to cut off the affectionate tie.
A pure devotee cuts off the limited ties of affection for his family and widens his activities of devotional service for all forgotten souls. The typical example is the band of Six Gosvämés, who followed the path of Lord Caitanya. All of them belonged to the most enlightened and cultured rich families of the higher castes, but for the benefit of the mass of population they left their comfortable homes and became mendicants. To cut off all family affection means to broaden the field of activities. Without doing this, no one can be qualified as a brähmaëa, a king, a public leader or a devotee of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead, as an ideal king, showed this by example. Çré Rämacandra cut off the tie of affection for His beloved wife to manifest the qualities of an ideal king.
Such personalities as a brähmaëa, a devotee, a king or a public leader must be very broadminded in discharging their respective duties. Çrématé Kuntédevé was conscious of this fact, and being weak she prayed to be free from such bondage of family affection. The Lord is addressed as the Lord of the universe, or the Lord of the universal mind, indicating His all-powerful ability to cut the hard knot of family affection. Therefore, it is sometimes experienced that the Lord, out of His special affinity towards a weak devotee, breaks the family affection by force of circumstances arranged by His all-powerful energy. By doing so He causes the devotee to become completely dependent on Him and thus clears the path for his going back to Godhead.

O Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto You without being diverted to anyone else.
PURPORT
Perfection of pure devotional service is attained when all attention is diverted towards the transcendental loving service of the Lord. To cut off the tie of all other affections does not mean complete negation of the finer elements, like affection for someone else. This is not possible. A living being, whoever he may be, must have this feeling of affection for others because this is a symptom of life. The symptoms of life, such as desire, anger, hankerings, feelings of attraction, etc., cannot be annihilated. Only the objective has to be changed. Desire cannot be negated, but in devotional service the desire is changed only for the service of the Lord in place of desire for sense gratification. The so-called affection for family, society, country, etc., consists of different phases of sense gratification. When this desire is changed for the satisfaction of the Lord, it is called devotional service.
In the Bhagavad-gétä we can see that it was just to satisfy his own personal desires that Arjuna refused to fight with his brothers and relations. But when he heard the message of the Lord, Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä, he changed his decision and served the Lord. And for his doing so, he became a famous devotee of the Lord, for it is declared in all the scriptures that Arjuna attained spiritual perfection by devotional service to the Lord in friendship. The fighting was there, the friendship was there, Arjuna was there, and Kåñëa was there, but Arjuna became a different person by devotional service. Therefore, the prayers of Kunté also indicate the same categorical changes in activities. Çrématé Kunté wanted to serve the Lord without diversion, and that was her prayer. This unalloyed devotion is the ultimate goal of life. Our attention is usually diverted to the service of something which is nongodly or not in the program of the Lord. When the program is changed into the service of the Lord, that is to say, when the senses are purified in relation with the service of the Lord, it is called pure unalloyed devotional service. Çrématé Kuntédevé wanted that perfection and prayed for it from the Lord.
Her affection for the Päëòavas and the Våñëis is not out of the range of devotional service because the service of the Lord and the service of the devotees are identical. Sometimes service to the devotee is more valuable than service to the Lord. But here the affection of Kuntédevé for the Päëòavas and the Våñëis was due to family relation. This tie of affection in terms of material relation is the relation of mäyä because the relations of the body or the mind are due to the influence of the external energy. Relations of the soul, established in relation with the Supreme Soul, are factual relations. When Kuntédevé wanted to cut off the family relation, she meant to cut off the relation of the skin. The skin relation is the cause of material bondage, but the relation of the soul is the cause of freedom. This relation of the soul to the soul can be established by the medium of the relation with the Supersoul. Seeing in the darkness is not seeing. But seeing by the light of the sun means to see the sun and everything else which was unseen in the darkness. That is the way of devotional service.

You are the proprietor of the transcendental abode, and You descend to relieve the distresses of the cows, the brähmaëas and the devotees. You possess all mystic powers, and You are the preceptor of the entire universe. You are the almighty God, and I offer You my respectful obeisances.

PURPORT
A summary of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa is made herein by Çrématé Kuntédevé. The almighty Lord has His eternal transcendental abode, where He is engaged in keeping surabhi cows. He is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. He descends to the material world to reclaim His devotees and to annihilate the disturbing elements amongst the groups of political parties and kings who are supposed to be in charge of administration work. He creates, maintains and annihilates by His unlimited energies, and still He is always full with prowess and does not deteriorate in potency. The cows, the brähmaëas and the devotees of the Lord are all objects of His special attention because they are very important factors for the general welfare of living beings.

TEXT 32
çré-bhéñma uväca
iti matir upakalpitä vitåñëä

çré-bhéñmaù uväca—Çré Bhéñmadeva said; iti—thus; matiù—thinking, feeling and willing; upakalpitä—invested; vitåñëä—freed from all sense desires; bhagavati—unto the Personality of Godhead; sätvata-puìgave—unto the leader of the devotees; vibhümni—unto the great; sva-sukham—self-satisfaction; upagate—unto Him who has attained it; kvacit—sometimes; vihartum—out of transcendental pleasure; prakåtim—in the material world; upeyuñi—do accept it; yat-bhava—from whom the creation; pravähaù—is made and annihilated.

Bhéñmadeva said: Let me now invest my thinking, feeling and willing, which were so long engaged in different subjects and occupational duties, in the all-powerful Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is always self-satisfied, but sometimes, being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending to the material world, although it is from Him only that the material world is created.

PURPORT
Because Bhéñmadeva was a statesman, the head of the Kuru dynasty, a great general and a leader of kñatriyas, his mind was strewn over so many subjects, and his thinking, feeling and willing were engaged in different matters. Now, in order to achieve pure devotional service, he wanted to invest all powers of thinking, feeling and willing entirely in the Supreme Being, Lord Kåñëa. He is described herein as the leader of the devotees and all-powerful. Although Lord Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead, He Himself descends to earth to bestow upon His pure devotees the boon of devotional service. He descends sometimes as Lord Kåñëa as He is, and sometimes as Lord Caitanya. Both are leaders of the pure devotees. Pure devotees of the Lord have no desire other than the service of the Lord, and therefore they are called sätvatas. The Lord is the chief amongst such sätvatas. Bhéñmadeva, therefore, had no other desires—he was completely free of all material desires. Unless one is purified from all sorts of material desires, the Lord does not become one's leader. Desires cannot be wiped out, but they have only to be purified. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä by the Lord Himself that He gives His instruction from within the heart of a pure devotee who is constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. Such instruction is given not for any material purpose but only for going back home, back to Godhead (Bg. 10.10). For the ordinary man who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord only sanctions and becomes a witness of activities, but He never gives the nondevotee instructions for going back to Godhead. That is the difference in dealings by the Lord with different living beings, both the devotee and the nondevotee. He is the leader of all the living beings, as the king of the state rules both the prisoners and the free citizens. But His dealings are different in terms of devotee and nondevotee. Nondevotees never care to take any instruction from the Lord, and therefore the Lord is silent in their case, although He witnesses all their activities and awards them the necessary results, good or bad. The devotees are above this material goodness and badness. They are progressive on the path of transcendence, and therefore they have no desire for anything material. The devotee also knows Çré Kåñëa as the original Näräyaëa because Lord Çré Kåñëa, by His plenary portion, appears as the Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, the original source of all material creation. The Lord also desires the association of His pure devotees, and for them only the Lord descends to the earth and enlivens them. The Lord appears out of His own will. He is not forced by the conditions of material nature. He is therefore described here as the vibhu, or the Almighty, for He is never conditioned by the laws of material nature.

tri-bhuvana—three statuses of planetary systems; kamanam—the most desirable; tamäla-varëam—bluish like the tamäla tree; ravi-kara—sunrays; gaura—golden color; varämbaram—glittering dress; dadhäne—one who wears; vapuù—body; alaka-kula-ävåta—covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp; änana-abjam—face like a lotus; vijaya-sakhe—unto the friend of Arjuna; ratiù astu—may attraction be reposed upon Him; me—my; anavadyä—without desire for fruitive results.

Çré Kåñëa is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in His transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tamäla tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems [upper, middle and lower]. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus face, covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results.

PURPORT
When Çré Kåñëa by His own internal pleasure appears on earth, He does so by the agency of His internal potency. The attractive features of His transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. Nowhere in the universe are there such beautiful bodily features as those of Lord Kåñëa. Therefore His transcendental body has nothing to do with anything materially created. Arjuna is described here as the conqueror, and Kåñëa is described as his intimate friend. Bhéñmadeva, on his bed of arrows after the Battle of Kurukñetra, is remembering the particular dress of Lord Kåñëa which He put on as the driver of Arjuna's chariot. While fighting was going on between Arjuna and Bhéñma, Bhéñma's attraction was drawn by the glittering dress of Kåñëa, and indirectly he admired his so-called enemy Arjuna for possessing the Lord as his friend. Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend. Bhéñmadeva takes this opportunity to address the Lord as vijaya-sakhe (friend of Arjuna) because the Lord is pleased when He is addressed conjointly with His devotees, who are related with Him in different transcendental humors. While Kåñëa was the charioteer of Arjuna, sunrays glittered on the dress of the Lord, and the beautiful hue created by the reflection of such rays was never forgotten by Bhéñmadeva. As a great fighter he was relishing the relation with Kåñëa in the chivalrous humor. Transcendental relation with the Lord in any one of the different rasas (humors) is relishable by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy. Less intelligent mundaners who want to make a show of being transcendentally related with the Lord artificially jump at once to the relation of conjugal love, imitating the damsels of Vrajadhäma. Such a cheap relation with the Lord exhibits only the base mentality of the mundaner because one who has relished conjugal humor with the Lord cannot be attached to worldly conjugal rasa, which is condemned even by mundane ethics. The eternal relation of a particular soul with the Lord is evolved. A genuine relation of the living being with the Supreme Lord can take any form out of the five principal rasas, and it does not make any difference in transcendental degree to the genuine devotee. Bhéñmadeva is a concrete example of this, and it should be carefully observed how the great general is transcendentally related with the Lord.

On the battlefield [where Çré Kåñëa attended Arjuna out of friendship], the flowing hair of Lord Kåñëa turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hoofs of the horses. And because of His labor, beads of sweat wetted His face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds on His skin dealt by my sharp arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto Çré Kåñëa.

PURPORT
The Lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. As such, transcendental loving service to the Lord in one of the five principal relations, namely çänta, däsya, sakhya, vätsalya and mädhurya, i.e., neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, parental affection and conjugal love, is graciously accepted by the Lord when offered to the Lord in genuine love and affection. Çré Bhéñmadeva is a great devotee of the Lord in the relation of servitorship. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the Lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon Him.
It appears that Bhéñmadeva is repenting the actions he committed against the person of the Lord. But factually the Lord's body was not at all pained, due to His transcendental existence. His body is not matter. Both He Himself and His body are complete spiritual identity. Spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened, etc. This is vividly explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. So also it is stated in the Skanda Puräëa. It is said there that spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible. It cannot be distressed, nor can it be dried up. When Lord Viñëu in His incarnation appears before us, He seems to be like one of the conditioned souls, materially encaged, just to bewilder the asuras, or the nonbelievers, who are always alert to kill the Lord, even from the very beginning of His appearance. Kaàsa wanted to kill Kåñëa, and Rävaëa wanted to kill Räma, because foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the Lord is never killed, for the spirit is never annihilated.
Therefore Bhéñmadeva's piercing of the body of Lord Kåñëa is a sort of bewildering problem for the nondevotee atheist, but those who are devotees, or liberated souls, are not bewildered.
Bhéñmadeva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the Lord: although He had been disturbed by Bhéñmadeva's sharp arrows, He had not left Arjuna alone, nor was He reluctant to come before Bhéñma's deathbed even though He had been ill-treated by him on the battlefield. Bhéñma's repentance and the Lord's merciful attitude are both unique in this picture.
Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, a great äcärya and devotee in the humor of conjugal love with the Lord, remarks very saliently in this regard. He says that the wounds created on the body of the Lord by the sharp arrows of Bhéñmadeva were as pleasing to the Lord as the biting of His fiancee when she bites the body of the Lord directed by a strong sense of sex desire. Such biting by the opposite sex is never taken as a sign of enmity, even if there is a wound on the body. Therefore, the fighting as an exchange of transcendental pleasure between the Lord and His pure devotee, Çré Bhéñmadeva, was not at all mundane. Besides that, since the Lord's body and the Lord are identical, there was no possibility of wounds in the absolute body. The apparent wounds caused by the sharp arrows are misleading to the common man, but one who has a little absolute knowledge can understand the transcendental exchange in the chivalrous relation. The Lord was perfectly happy with the wounds caused by the sharp arrows of Bhéñmadeva. The word vibhidyamäna is significant because the Lord's skin is not different from the Lord. Because our skin is different from our soul, in our case the word vibhidyamäna, or "being bruised and cut," would have been quite suitable. Transcendental bliss is of different varieties, and the variety of activities in the mundane world is but a perverted reflection of transcendental bliss. Because everything in the mundane world is qualitatively mundane, it is full of inebrieties, whereas in the absolute realm, because everything is of the same absolute nature, there are varieties of enjoyment without inebriety. The Lord enjoyed the wounds created by His great devotee Bhéñmadeva, and because Bhéñmadeva is a devotee in the chivalrous relation, he fixes up his mind on Kåñëa in that wounded condition.

sapadi—on the battlefield; sakhi-vacaù—command of the friend; niçamya—after hearing; madhye—in the midst; nija—His own; parayoù—and the opposite party; balayoù—strength; ratham—chariot; niveçya—having entered; sthitavati—while staying there; para-sainika—of the soldiers on the opposite side; äyuù—duration of life; akñëä—by looking over; håtavati—act of diminishing; pärtha—of Arjuna, son of Påthä (Kunté); sakhe—unto the friend; ratiù—intimate relation; mama—my; astu—let there be.

In obedience to the command of His friend, Lord Çré Kåñëa entered the arena of the Battlefield of Kurukñetra between the soldiers of Arjuna and Duryodhana, and while there He shortened the life spans of the opposite party by His merciful glance. This was done simply by His looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that Kåñëa.

PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gétä (1.21-25) Arjuna ordered the infallible Lord Çré Kåñëa to place his chariot between the phalanxes of the soldiers. He asked Him to stay there until he had finished observing the enemies he had to face in the battle. When the Lord was so asked, He at once did so, just like an order carrier. And the Lord pointed out all the important men on the opposite side, saying, "Here is Bhéñma, here is Droëa," and so on. The Lord, being the supreme living being, is never the order supplier or order carrier of anyone, whoever he may be. But out of His causeless mercy and affection for His pure devotees, sometimes He carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant. By executing the order of a devotee, the Lord becomes pleased, as a father is pleased to carry out the order of his small child. This is possible only out of pure transcendental love between the Lord and His devotees, and Bhéñmadeva was quite aware of this fact. He therefore addressed the Lord as the friend of Arjuna.
The Lord diminished the duration of life of the opposite party by His merciful glance. It is said that all the fighters who assembled on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra attained salvation by personally seeing the Lord at the time of death. Therefore, His diminishing the duration of life of Arjuna's enemy does not mean that He was partial to the cause of Arjuna. Factually He was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life. Here was a chance to see the Lord at the time of death and thus attain salvation from material life. Therefore, the Lord is all-good, and whatever He does is for everyone's good. Apparently it was for the victory of Arjuna, His intimate friend, but factually it was for the good of Arjuna's enemies. Such are the transcendental activities of the Lord, and whoever understands this also gets salvation after quitting this material body. The Lord does no wrong in any circumstance because He is absolute, all-good at all times.

When Arjuna was seemingly polluted by ignorance upon observing the soldiers and commanders before him on the battlefield, the Lord eradicated his ignorance by delivering transcendental knowledge. May His lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction.

PURPORT
The kings and the commanders were to stand in the front of the fighting soldiers. That was the system of actual fighting. The kings and commanders were not so-called presidents or ministers of defense, as they are today. They would not stay home while the poor soldiers or mercenaries were fighting face to face. This may be the regulation of modern democracy, but when actual monarchy was prevailing, the monarchs were not cowards elected without consideration of royal qualification. As it was evident from the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, all the executive heads of both parties, like Droëa, Bhéñma, Arjuna and Duryodhana, were not sleeping; all of them were actual participants in the fighting, which was selected to be executed at a place away from the civil residential quarters. This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties. The citizens had no business in seeing what was going to happen during such fighting. They were to pay one fourth of their income to the ruler, whether he be Arjuna or Duryodhana. All the commanders of the parties on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra were standing face to face, and Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the empire. He was not at all afraid of the giant military phalanx presented by Duryodhana, but because he was a merciful devotee of the Lord, renunciation of worldly things was natural for him, and thus he decided not to fight for worldly possessions. But this was due to a poor fund of knowledge, and therefore it is said here that his intelligence became polluted. His intelligence could not be polluted at any time because he was a devotee and constant companion of the Lord, as is clear in the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä. Arjuna's intelligence became apparently polluted because otherwise there would not have been a chance to deliver the teachings of the Bhagavad-gétä for the good of all polluted conditioned souls encaged in material bondage by their misconceptions concerning their relationship with the false material body. The Bhagavad-gétä was delivered to the conditioned souls of the world to deliver them from the wrong conception of identifying the body with the soul and to reestablish the soul's eternal relation with the Supreme Lord. Ätma-vidyä, or transcendental knowledge of Himself, was primarily spoken by the Lord for the benefit of all concerned in all parts of the universe.

Fulfilling my vow and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way.

PURPORT
The Battle of Kurukñetra was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spirit, as a friend fights with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bhéñmadeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. A kñatriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bhéñmadeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five Päëòavas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana, and Bhéñmadeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord Kåñëa. So he took a vow that the next day Kåñëa would have to take up weapons Himself or His friend Arjuna would die. In the next day's fighting Bhéñmadeva fought so violently that both Arjuna and Kåñëa were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bhéñmadeva the very next moment. At that time Lord Kåñëa wanted to please His devotee Bhéñma by keeping Bhéñma's promise, which was more important than His own. Thus seemingly He broke His own promise. He had promised before the beginning of the Battle of Kurukñetra that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bhéñmadeva in an angry mood, as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bhéñmadeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by Kåñëa, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very moment, and Arjuna was saved. Of course, there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord Himself was on the chariot, but because Bhéñmadeva wanted to see Lord Kåñëa take up some weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna's death appear imminent. He stood before Bhéñmadeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel.

May He, Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination. On the battlefield He charged me, as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield was scattered, and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.

PURPORT
The dealings of Lord Kåñëa and Bhéñmadeva on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra are interesting because the activities of Lord Çré Kåñëa appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bhéñmadeva; but factually all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bhéñmadeva, a great devotee of the Lord. The astounding feature of such dealings is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy. The Lord, being absolute, can accept service from His pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy harm Him because He is ajita, or unconquerable. But still He takes pleasure when His pure devotee beats Him like an enemy or rebukes Him from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord. These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. And those who have no information of pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings. Bhéñmadeva played the part of a valiant warrior, and he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was wounded, but factually all this was to bewilder the nondevotees. The Lord's all-spiritual body cannot be wounded, and a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Had it been so, Bhéñmadeva would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. Had Bhéñmadeva been an enemy of the Lord, Lord Kåñëa could have annihilated him without even moving. There would have been no need to come before Bhéñmadeva with blood and wounds. But He did so because the warrior devotee wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee. This is the way of exchanging transcendental rasa, or relations between the Lord and the servitor. By such dealings both the Lord and the devotee become glorified in their respective positions. The Lord was so angry that Arjuna checked Him when He was moving towards Bhéñmadeva, but in spite of Arjuna's checking, He proceeded towards Bhéñmadeva as a lover goes to a lover, without caring for hindrances. Apparently His determination was to kill Bhéñmadeva, but factually it was to please him, a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord is undoubtedly the deliverer of all conditioned souls. The impersonalists desire salvation from Him, and He always awards them according to their aspiration, but here Bhéñmadeva prays that the ultimate destination of his life be the Lord in His personal feature. All pure devotees aspire for this.

At the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon Arjuna's chariot driver, who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, and who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna's chariot by all means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra attained their original forms after death.
PURPORT
A pure devotee of the Lord constantly sees the presence of the Lord within himself because of being transcendentally related by loving service. Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. This is called trance. The mystic yogé tries to concentrate upon the Supersoul by restraining the senses from all other engagements, and thus he ultimately attains samädhi. A devotee more easily attains samädhi, or trance, by constantly remembering the Lord's personal feature along with His holy name, fame, pastimes, etc. Therefore, the concentration of the mystic yogé and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration of the mystic yogé is mechanical, whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. Bhéñmadeva was a pure devotee, and as a military marshal he constantly remembered the battlefield feature of the Lord as Pärtha-särathi, the chariot driver of Arjuna. Therefore, the Lord's pastime as Pärtha-särathi is also eternal. The pastimes of the Lord, beginning from His birth at the prison house of Kaàsa up to the mausala-lélä at the end, all move one after another in all the universes, just as the clock hand moves from one point to another. And in such pastimes His associates like the Päëòavas and Bhéñma are constant eternal companions. So Bhéñmadeva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as Pärtha-särathi, which even Arjuna could not see. Arjuna was behind the beautiful Pärtha-särathi, while Bhéñmadeva was just in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concerned, Bhéñmadeva observed this with more relish than Arjuna.
All the soldiers and other persons on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra attained their original spiritual forms after their death because by the causeless mercy of the Lord they were able to see Him face to face on that occasion. The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle from the aquatics up to the form of Brahmä are all in the form of mäyä, or the form obtained by one's own actions and awarded by material nature. The material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dresses, and when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of the material energy, he attains his original spiritual form, like the Lord's. The impersonalist wants to attain the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lord, but that is not at all congenial to the living sparks, parts and parcels of the Lord. Therefore, the impersonalists again fall down and get material forms, which are all false to the spirit soul. A spiritual form like the Lord's, either two-handed or four-handed, is attained by the devotees of the Lord, either in the Vaikuëöhas or in the Goloka planet, according to the original nature of the soul. This form, which is cent per cent spiritual, is the svarüpa of the living being, and all the living beings who participated on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, on both sides, attained their svarüpa, as confirmed by Bhéñmadeva. So Lord Çré Kåñëa was not merciful only to the Päëòavas; He was also merciful to the other parties because all of them attained the same result. Bhéñmadeva wanted the same facility also, and that was his prayer to the Lord, although his position as an associate of the Lord is assured in all circumstances. The conclusion is that whoever dies looking on the Personality of Godhead within or without attains his svarüpa, which is the highest perfection of life.

Let my mind be fixed upon Lord Çré Kåñëa, whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of Vrajadhäma [the gopés]. The damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the Lord [after His disappearance from the räsa dance].

PURPORT
By intense ecstasy in loving service, the damsels of Vrajabhümi attained qualitative oneness with the Lord by dancing with Him on an equal level, embracing Him in nuptial love, smiling at Him in joke, and looking at Him with a loving attitude. The relation of the Lord with Arjuna is undoubtedly praiseworthy for devotees like Bhéñmadeva, but the relation of the gopés with the Lord is still more praiseworthy because of their still more purified loving service. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna was fortunate enough to have the fraternal service of the Lord as chariot driver, but the Lord did not award Arjuna with equal strength. The gopés, however, practically became one with the Lord by attainment of equal footing with the Lord. Bhéñma's aspiration to remember the gopés is a prayer to have their mercy also at the last stage of his life. The Lord is satisfied more when His pure devotees are glorified, and therefore Bhéñmadeva has not only glorified the acts of Arjuna, his immediate object of attraction, but has also remembered the gopés, who were endowed with unrivalled opportunities for rendering loving service to the Lord. The gopés' equality with the Lord should never be misunderstood to be like the säyujya liberation of the impersonalist. The equality is one of perfect ecstasy, where the differential conception is completely eradicated, for the interests of the lover and the beloved become identical.

At the Räjasüya yajïa [sacrifice] performed by Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, there was the greatest assembly of all the elite men of the world, the royal and learned orders, and in that great assembly Lord Çré Kåñëa was worshiped by one and all as the most exalted Personality of Godhead. This happened during my presence, and I remember the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord.

PURPORT
After gaining victory in the Battle of Kurukñetra, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, the Emperor of the world, performed the Räjasüya sacrificial ceremony. The emperor, in those days, upon his ascendance to the throne, would send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacy, and any ruling prince or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey the supremacy of the particular emperor. One who accepted the challenge had to fight with the emperor and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated king would have to sacrifice his life, making a place for another king or ruler. So Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira's leadership as the Emperor of the world. After this, all rulers of the world under the regime of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of Räjasüya. Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremony, being too expensive and also difficult to perform under present circumstances, is now impossible in this Age of Kali. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of the ceremony.
So, after being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world assembled in the capital of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira. The learned society, including the great philosophers, religionists, physicians, scientists and all great sages, was invited. That is to say, the brähmaëas and the kñatriyas were the topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to participate in the assembly. The vaiçyas and çüdras were unimportant elements in society, and they are not mentioned herein. Due to the change of social activities in the modern age, the importance of men has also changed in terms of occupational positions.
So in that great assembly, Lord Çré Kåñëa was the cynosure of neighboring eyes. Everyone wanted to see Lord Kåñëa, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord. Bhéñmadeva remembered all this and was glad that his worshipable Lord, the Personality of Godhead, was present before him in His actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord is to meditate on the activities, form, pastimes, name and fame of the Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. In the Bhagavad-gétä (12.5) it is clearly stated that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very difficult. It is practically no meditation or simply a waste of time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. The devotees, however, meditate upon the Lord's factual form and pastimes, and therefore the Lord is easily approachable by the devotees. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (12.9). The Lord is nondifferent from His transcendental activities. It is indicated also in this çloka that Lord Çré Kåñëa, while actually present before human society, especially in connection with the Battle of Kurukñetra, was accepted as the greatest personality of the time, although He might not have been recognized as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The propaganda that a very great man is worshiped as God after his death is misleading because a man after his death cannot be made into God. Nor can the Personality of Godhead be a human being, even when He is personally present. Both ideas are misconceptions. The idea of anthropomorphism cannot be applicable in the case of Lord Kåñëa.

tam—that Personality of Godhead; imam—now present before me; aham—I; ajam—the unborn; çaréra-bhäjäm—of the conditioned soul; hådi—in the heart; hådi—in the heart; dhiñöhitam—situated; ätma—the Supersoul; kalpitänäm—of the speculators; pratidåçam—in every direction; iva—like; na ekadhä—not one; arkam—the sun; ekam—one only; samadhigataù asmi—I have undergone trance in meditation; vidhüta—being freed from; bheda-mohaù—misconception of duality.

Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord, Çré Kåñëa, now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone's heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone's heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.

PURPORT
Lord Çré Kåñëa is the one Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He has expanded Himself into His multiplenary portions and multidifferentiated portions by His inconceivable energy. The conception of duality is due to ignorance of His inconceivable energy. In the Bhagavad-gétä (9.11) the Lord says that only the foolish take Him to be a mere human being. Such foolish men are not aware of His inconceivable energies. By His inconceivable energy He is present in everyone's heart, as the sun is present before everyone all over the world. The Paramätmä feature of the Lord is an expansion of His plenary portions. He expands Himself as Paramätmä in everyone's heart by His inconceivable energy, and He also expands Himself as the glowing effulgence of brahma-jyoti by expansion of His personal glow. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä that the brahma-jyoti is His personal glow. Therefore, there is no difference between Him and His personal glow (brahma-jyoti) or His plenary portions as Paramätmä. Less intelligent persons who are not aware of this fact consider brahma-jyoti and Paramätmä to be different from Çré Kåñëa. This misconception of duality is completely removed from the mind of Bhéñmadeva, and he is now satisfied that it is Lord Çré Kåñëa only who is all in all in everything. This enlightenment is attained by the great mahätmäs, or devotees, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.19): the devotees realize that Väsudeva is all in all in everything and that there is no existence of anything without Väsudeva. Väsudeva, or Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the original Supreme Person, as now confirmed by Bhéñmadeva. Since Bhéñmadeva is one of the twelve mahäjanas, or great authorities, both the neophytes and the pure devotees must try to follow in his footsteps. That is the way of the devotional line.
The worshipable object of Bhéñmadeva is Lord Çré Kåñëa as Pärtha-särathi, and that of the gopés is the same Kåñëa in Våndävana as the most attractive Çyämasundara. Sometimes less intelligent scholars make a mistake and think that the Kåñëa of Våndävana and that of the Battle of Kurukñetra are different personalities. But for Bhéñmadeva this misconception is completely removed. Even the impersonalist's object of destination is Kåñëa as the impersonal jyoti, and the yogé's destination of Paramätmä is also Kåñëa. Kåñëa is both brahma-jyoti and localized Paramätmä, but brahma-jyoti and Paramätmä are not full representations of Kåñëa. In Kåñëa there are both brahma-jyoti and Paramätmä, but in brahma-jyoti or Paramätmä there is no Kåñëa or sweet relations with Kåñëa. In His personal feature Kåñëa is both Pärtha-särathi and Çyämasundara of Våndävana, but only in His impersonal feature is He the brahma-jyoti and the Paramätmä. Great mahätmäs like Bhéñmadeva realize all these different features of Lord Çré Kåñëa, and therefore they worship Lord Kåñëa with one-pointed attention, knowing Him as the origin of all features.

saù—He (Kåñëa); vai—as we remember; kila—definitely; ayam—this; puruñaù—Personality of Godhead; purätanaù—the original; yaù—who; ekaù—only one; äsét—existed; aviçeñaù—materially unmanifested; ätmani—own self; agre—before creation; guëebhyaù—of the modes of nature; jagat-ätmani—unto the Supersoul; éçvare—unto the Supreme Lord; nimélita—merged into; ätman—the living entity; niçi supta—inactive at night; çaktiñu—of the energies.

The ladies said: Here He is, the original Personality of Godhead as we definitely remember Him. He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature, and into Him only, because He is the Supreme Lord, all living beings merge, as if sleeping at night, their energy suspended.

PURPORT
There are two types of dissolution of the manifested cosmos. At the end of every 8,640,000,000 solar years, when Brahmä, the lord of one particular universe, goes to sleep, there is one annihilation. And at the end of Lord Brahmä's life, which takes place at the end of Brahmä's one hundred years of age, in our calculation at the end of 8,640,000,000 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years, there is complete annihilation of the entire universe, and in both annihilations both the material energy, called the mahat-tattva, and the marginal energy, called the jéva-tattva, merge into the person of the Supreme Lord. The living beings remain asleep within the body of the Lord until there is another creation of the material world, and that is the way of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation.
The material creation is effected by the interaction of the three modes of material nature set in motion by the Lord, and therefore it is said here that the Lord existed before the modes of material nature were set in motion. In the çruti-mantra it is said that only Viñëu, the Supreme Lord, existed before the creation, when there was no Brahmä, Çiva or other demigods. Viñëu means the Mahä-Viñëu, who is lying on the Causal Ocean. By His breathing only all the universes are generated in seeds and gradually develop into gigantic forms with innumerable planets within each and every universe. The seeds of universes develop into gigantic forms in the way seeds of a banyan tree develop into numberless banyan trees.
This Mahä-Viñëu is the plenary portion of the Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is mentioned in the Brahma-saàhitä as follows:
"Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda, whose plenary portion is the Mahä-Viñëu. All the Brahmäs, the heads of the universes, live only for the period of His exhaling, after the universes are generated from the pores of His transcendental body." (Bs. 5.48)
Thus Govinda, or Lord Kåñëa, is the cause of Mahä-Viñëu also. The ladies talking about this Vedic truth must have heard it from authoritative sources. An authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no alternative.
The merging of the living beings into the body of Mahä-Viñëu takes place automatically at the end of Brahmä's one hundred years. But that does not mean that the individual living being loses his identity. The identity is there, and as soon as there is another creation by the supreme will of the Lord, all the sleeping, inactive living beings are again let loose to begin their activities in the continuation of past different spheres of life. It is called suptotthita naya, or awakening from sleep and again engaging in one's respective continuous duty. When a man is asleep at night, he forgets himself—what he is, what his duty is and everything else of his waking state. But as soon as he awakens from slumber, he remembers all that he has to do and thus engages himself again in his prescribed activities. The living beings also remain merged in the body of Mahä-Viñëu during the period of annihilation, but as soon as there is another creation they arise to take up their unfinished work. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (8.18-20).
The Lord existed before the creative energy was set in action. The Lord is not a product of the material energy. His body is completely spiritual, and there is no difference between His body and Himself. Before creation the Lord remained in His abode, which is absolute and one.

The Personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to His parts and parcels, the living entities, placed them under the guidance of material nature. By His own potency, material nature is empowered to re-create.

PURPORT
The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are of two varieties, namely nitya-mukta and nitya-baddha. The nitya-muktas are eternally liberated souls, and they are eternally engaged in the reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in His eternal abode, beyond the manifested mundane creations. But the nitya-baddhas, or eternally conditioned souls, are entrusted to His external energy, mäyä, for rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the supreme father. Nitya-baddhas are eternally forgetful of their relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. Bewildered by the illusory energy, they think they are products of matter, and thus they are very busy in making plans in the material world for becoming happy. They go on merrily with such plans, but by the will of the Lord both the planmakers and the plans are annihilated at the end of a certain period, as above mentioned. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä as follows: "O son of Kunté, at the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into My nature, and again when the time of creation is ripe, I begin creation by the agency of My external energy." (Bg. 9.7)
The word bhüyaù indicates "again and again"; that is to say, the process of creation, maintenance and annihilation is going on perpetually by the external energy of the Lord. He is the cause of everything. But the living beings, who are constitutionally the parts and parcels of the Lord and are forgetful of the sweet relation, are given a chance again and again to get rid of the clutches of the external energy. And to revive his (the living being's) consciousness, the Lord also creates the revealed scriptures. Vedic literatures are the guiding directions for the conditioned souls so they can get free from the repetition of creation and annihilation of the material world and the material body.
The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gétä, "This created world and material energy are under My control. Under the influence of prakåti, automatically they are created again and again, and this is done by Me through the agency of My external energy."
Actually the spiritual spark living entities have no material names or forms. But in order to fulfill their desire to lord it over the material energy of material forms and names, they are given a chance for such false enjoyment, and at the same time they are given a chance to understand the real position through the revealed scriptures. The foolish and forgetful living being is always busy with false forms and false names. Modern nationalism is the culmination of such false names and false forms. Men are mad after false names and forms. The form of body obtained under certain conditions is taken up as factual, and the name also taken bewilders the conditioned soul into misusing the energy in the name of so many "isms." The scriptures, however, supply the clue for understanding the real position, but men are reluctant to take lessons from the scriptures created by the Lord for different places and times. For example, the Bhagavad-gétä is the guiding principle for every human being, but by the spell of the material energy people do not take care to carry out the programs of life in terms of the Bhagavad-gétä. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the postgraduate study of knowledge for one who has thoroughly understood the principles of the Bhagavad-gétä. Unfortunately people have no taste for them, and therefore they are under the clutches of mäyä for repetition of birth and death.

Here is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is experienced by the great devotees who are completely cleansed of material consciousness by dint of rigid devotional service and full control of life and the senses. And that is the only way to purify one's existence.

PURPORT
As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord can be known in His real nature by dint of pure devotional service only. So it is stated here that only the great devotees of the Lord who are able to clear the mind of all material dust by rigid devotional service can experience the Lord as He is. Jitendriya means one who has full control over the senses. The senses are active parts of the body, and their activities cannot be stopped. The artificial means of the yogic processes to make the senses inactive has proved to be an abject failure, even in the case of great yogés like Viçvämitra Muni. Viçvämitra Muni controlled the senses by yogic trance, but when he happened to meet Menakä (a heavenly society woman), he became a victim of sex, and the artificial way of controlling the senses failed. But in the case of a pure devotee, the senses are not at all artificially stopped from doing anything, but they are given different good engagements. When the senses are engaged in more attractive activities, there is no chance of their being attracted by any inferior engagements. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the senses can be controlled only by better engagements. Devotional service necessitates purifying the senses by engaging them in the activities of devotional service. Devotional service is not inaction. Anything done in the service of the Lord becomes at once purified of its material nature. The material conception is due to ignorance only. There is nothing beyond Väsudeva. The Väsudeva conception gradually develops in the heart of the learned after a prolonged acceleration of the receptive organs. But the process ends in the knowledge of accepting Väsudeva as all in all. In the case of devotional service, this very same method is accepted from the very beginning, and by the grace of the Lord all factual knowledge becomes revealed in the heart of a devotee due to dictation by the Lord from within. Therefore controlling the senses by devotional service is the only and easiest means.

såjaty avaty atti na tatra sajjate


saù—He; vai—also; ayam—this; sakhi—O my friend; anugéta—described; sat-kathaù—the excellent pastimes; vedeñu—in the Vedic literatures; guhyeñu—confidentially; ca—as also; guhya-vädibhiù—by the confidential devotees; yaù—one who; ekaù—one only; éçaù—the supreme controller; jagat—of the complete creation; ätma—Supersoul; lélayä—by manifestation of pastimes; såjati—creates; avati atti—also maintains and annihilates; na—never; tatra—there; sajjate—becomes attached to it.

O dear friends, here is that very Personality of Godhead whose attractive and confidential pastimes are described in the confidential parts of Vedic literature by His great devotees. It is He only who creates, maintains and annihilates the material world and yet remains unaffected.

PURPORT
As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, all the Vedic literatures are glorifying the greatness of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Here it is confirmed in the Bhägavatam also. The Vedas are expanded by many branches and subbranches by great devotees and empowered incarnations of the Lord like Vyäsa, Närada, Çukadeva Gosvämé, the Kumäras, Kapila, Prahläda, Janaka, Bali and Yamaräja, but in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam especially, the confidential parts of His activities are described by the confidential devotee Çukadeva Gosvämé. In the Vedänta-sütras or Upaniñads there is only a hint of the confidential parts of His pastimes. In such Vedic literatures as the Upaniñads, the Lord has expressively been distinguished from the mundane conception of His existence. His identity being fully spiritual, His form, name, qualities, and paraphernalia, etc., have been elaborately distinguished from matter, and therefore He is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent persons as impersonal. But factually He is the Supreme Person, Bhagavän, and He is partially represented as Paramätmä or impersonal Brahman.
TEXT 25
yadä hy adharmeëa tamo-dhiyo nåpä
jévanti tatraiña hi sattvataù kila
dhatte bhagaà satyam åtaà dayäà yaço
bhaväya rüpäëi dadhad yuge yuge


yadä—whenever; hi—assuredly; adharmeëa—against the principles of God's will; tamaù-dhiyaù—persons in the lowest material modes; nåpäù—kings and administrators; jévanti—live like animals; tatra—thereupon; eñaù—He; hi—only; sattvataù—transcendental; kila—certainly; dhatte—is manifested; bhagam—supreme power; satyam—truth; åtam—positiveness; dayäm—mercy; yaçaù—wonderful activities; bhaväya—for the maintenance; rüpäëi—in various forms; dadhat—manifesting; yuge—different periods; yuge—and ages.

Whenever there are kings and administrators living like animals in the lowest modes of existence, the Lord in His transcendental form manifests His supreme power, the Truth Positive, shows special mercy to the faithful and performs wonderful activities. He thus manifests various transcendental forms in different periods and ages, as necessary.

PURPORT
As mentioned above, the cosmic creation is the property of the Supreme Lord. This is the basic philosophy of the Éçopaniñad: everything is the property of the Supreme Being. No one should encroach upon the property of the Supreme Lord. One should accept only what is kindly awarded by Him. Therefore, the earth or any other planet or universe is the absolute property of the Lord. The living beings are certainly His parts and parcels, or sons, and thus every one of them has a right to live at the mercy of the Lord to execute his prescribed work. No one, therefore, can encroach upon the right of another individual man or animal without being so sanctioned by the Lord. The king or the administrator is the representative of the Lord to look after the management of the Lord's will. He must therefore be a recognized person like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira or Parékñit. Such kings have full responsibility and knowledge from authorities about the administration of the world. But at times, due to the influence of the ignorance mode of material nature (tamo-guëa), the lowest of the material modes, kings and administrators come into power without knowledge and responsibility, and such foolish administrators live like animals for the sake of their own personal interest. The result is that the whole atmosphere becomes surcharged with anarchy and vicious elements. Nepotism, bribery, cheating, aggression and, therefore, famine, epidemic, war and similar other disturbing features become prominent in human society. And the devotees of the Lord, or the faithful, are persecuted by all means. All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä.
The Lord then appears in His transcendental form without any tinge of material qualities. He descends just to keep the state of His creation in a normal condition. The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings. They can happily live and execute their predestined occupations to attain salvation at the end, following the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures. The material world is created to satisfy the whims of the nitya-baddhas, or everlastingly conditioned souls, just as playing cradles are provided for naughty boys. Otherwise, there was no need of the material world. But when the conditioned souls become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord, and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord's incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful.
When He descends, He exhibits superhuman acts just to prove His supreme right, and materialists like Rävaëa, Hiraëyakaçipu and Kaàsa are sufficiently punished. He acts in a manner which no one can imitate. For example, the Lord, when He appeared as Räma, bridged the Indian Ocean. When He appeared as Kåñëa, from His very childhood He showed superhuman activities by killing Pütanä, Aghäsura, Çakaöäsura, Käliya, etc., and then His maternal uncle Kaàsa. When He was at Dvärakä He married 16, 108 queens, and all of them were blessed with a sufficient number of children. The sum total of His personal family members amounted to about ten million, popularly known as the Yadu-vaàça. And again, during His lifetime, He managed to vanquish them all. He is famous as the Govardhana-dhäré Hari because He lifted at the age of only seven the hill known as Govardhana. The Lord killed many undesirable kings in His time, and as a kñatriya He fought chivalrously. He is famous as asamordhva, unparalleled. No one is equal to or greater than Him.
TEXT 26

aho alaà çläghyatamaà yadoù kulam
aho alaà puëyatamaà madhor vanam
yad eña puàsäm åñabhaù çriyaù patiù

aho—oh; alam—verily; çläghya-tamam—supremely glorified; yadoù—of King Yadu; kulam—dynasty; aho—oh; alam—verily; puëya-tamam—supremely virtuous; madhoù vanam—the land of Mathurä; yat—because; eñaù—this; puàsäm—of all the living beings; åñabhaù—supreme leader; çriyaù—of the goddess of fortune; patiù—husband; sva-janmanä—by His appearance; caìkramaëena—by crawling; ca aïcati—glories.

Oh, how supremely glorified is the dynasty of King Yadu, and how virtuous is the land of Mathurä, where the supreme leader of all living beings, the husband of the goddess of fortune, has taken His birth and wandered in His childhood.

PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gétä the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa has expressively given a description of His transcendental appearance, disappearance and activities. The Lord appears in a particular family or place by His inconceivable potency. He does not take His birth as a conditioned soul does, quitting one body and accepting another body. His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun. The sun rises on the eastern horizon, but that does not mean that the eastern horizon is the parent of the sun. The sun is existent in every part of the universe, but he becomes visible at a scheduled time and so also becomes invisible at another scheduled time. Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves our sight at another time. He exists at all times and at every place, but by His causeless mercy when He appears before us we take it for granted that He has taken His birth. Anyone who can understand this truth, in terms of the statements of revealed scriptures, certainly becomes liberated just after quitting the present body. Liberation is obtainable after many births and after great endeavor with patience and perseverance, and with knowledge and renunciation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord's transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once. That is the verdict of the Bhagavad-gétä (4.9). But those who are in the darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord's birth and activities in the material world are similar to those of the ordinary living being. Such imperfect conclusions cannot give anyone liberation. His birth, therefore, in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and His transfer into the family of Nanda Mahäräja in the land of Mathurä are all transcendental arrangements made by the internal potency of the Lord. The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of the land of Mathurä cannot be materially estimated. If simply by knowing the transcendental nature of the birth and activities of the Lord one can get liberation easily, we can just imagine what is in store for those who actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member or as a neighbor. All those who were fortunate enough to associate with the Lord, the husband of the goddess of fortune, certainly obtained something more than what is known as liberation. Therefore, rightly, the dynasty and the land are both ever glorious by the grace of the Lord.
TEXT 27
aho bata svar-yaçasas tiraskaré
kuçasthalé puëya-yaçaskaré bhuvaù
paçyanti nityaà yad anugraheñitaà
smitävalokaà sva-patià sma yat-prajäù


aho bata—how wonderful this is; svaù-yaçasaù—the glories of the heavenly planets; tiraskaré—that which defeats; kuçasthalé—Dvärakä; puëya—virtue; yaçaskaré—famous; bhuvaù—the planet earth; paçyanti—see; nityam—constantly; yat—that which; anugraha-iñitam—to bestow benediction; smita-avalokam—glance with the favor of sweet smiling; sva-patim—unto the soul of the living being (Kåñëa); sma—used to; yat-prajäù—the inhabitants of the place.

Undoubtedly it is wonderful that Dvärakä has defeated the glories of the heavenly planets and has enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The inhabitants of Dvärakä are always seeing the soul of all living beings [Kåñëa] in His loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with sweet smiles.

PURPORT
The heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuëa and Väyu, and the pious souls reach there after performance of many virtuous acts on earth. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in higher planetary systems is different from that of the earth. Thus it is understood from the revealed scriptures that the duration of life there is ten thousand years (by our calculation). Six months on earth is equal to one day on the heavenly planets. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly enhanced, and the beauty of the inhabitants is legendary. Common men on the earth are very much fond of reaching the heavenly planets because they have heard that comforts of life are far greater there than on the earth. They are now trying to reach the moon by spacecraft. Considering all this, the heavenly planets are more celebrated than the earth. But the celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets because of Dvärakä, where Lord Çré Kåñëa reigned as king. Three places, namely Våndävana, Mathurä and Dvärakä, are more important than the famous planets within the universe. These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends to earth He displays His transcendental activities particularly in these three places. They are perpetually the holy lands of the Lord, and the inhabitants still take advantage of the holy places, even though the Lord is now out of their sight. The Lord is the soul of all living beings, and He desires always to have all the living beings, in their svarüpa, in their constitutional position, to participate in transcendental life in His association. His attractive features and sweet smiles go deep into the heart of everyone, and once it is so done the living being is admitted into the kingdom of God, from which no one returns. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä.
The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities of material enjoyment, but as we learn from the Bhagavad-gétä (9.20-21), one has to come back again to the earth planet as soon as the acquired virtue is finished. Dvärakä is certainly more important than the heavenly planets because whoever has been favored with the smiling glance of the Lord shall never come back again to this rotten earth, which is certified by the Lord Himself as a place of misery. Not only this earth but also all other planets of the universe are places of misery because in none of the planets within the universe are there eternal life, eternal bliss and eternal knowledge. Any person engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is recommended to live in one of the above-mentioned three places, namely Dvärakä, Mathurä or Våndävana. Because devotional service in these three places is magnified, those who go there to follow the principles in terms of instructions imparted in the revealed scriptures surely achieve the same result as obtained during the presence of Lord Çré Kåñëa. His abode and He Himself are identical, and a pure devotee under the guidance of another experienced devotee can obtain all the results, even at present.
TEXT 28
nünaà vrata-snäna-hutädineçvaraù
samarcito hy asya gåhéta-päëibhiù
pibanti yäù sakhy adharämåtaà muhur
vraja-striyaù sammumuhur yad-äçayäù


nünam—certainly in the previous birth; vrata—vows; snäna—baths; huta—sacrifices in the fire; ädinä—by all these; éçvaraù—the Personality of Godhead; samarcitaù—perfectly worshiped; hi—certainly; asya—His; gåhéta-päëibhiù—by the married wives; pibanti—relish; yäù—those who; sakhi—O friends; adhara-amåtam—the nectar from His lips; muhuù—again and again; vraja-striyaù—the damsels of Vrajabhümi; sammumuhuù—often fainted; yat-äçayäù—expecting to be favored in that way.

O friends, just think of His wives, whose hands He has accepted. How they must have undergone vows, taken baths, and performed fire sacrifices and perfect worship of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar from His lips [by kissing]. The damsels of Vrajabhümi would often faint just by expecting such favors.

PURPORT
Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls to enable them to be gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service unto the Supreme Lord. Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the highest perfection, and this stage is called svarüpa, or the factual identity of the living being. Liberation means renovation of this stage of svarüpa. In that perfect stage of svarüpa, the living being is established in five phases of loving service, one of which is the stage of mädhurya-rasa, or the humor of conjugal love. The Lord is always perfect in Himself, and thus He has no hankering for Himself. He, however, becomes a master, a friend, a son or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concerned. Herein two classes of devotees of the Lord are mentioned in the stage of conjugal love. One is svakéya, and the other is parakéya. Both classes of devotees are in a relation of conjugal love with the Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. The queens at Dvärakä were svakéya, or duly married wives, but the damsels of Vraja were young friends of the Lord while He was unmarried. The Lord stayed at Våndävana till the age of sixteen, and His friendly relations with the neighboring girls were in terms of parakéya. These girls, as well as the queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows, bathing and offering sacrifices in the fire, as prescribed in the scriptures. The rites, as they are, are not an end in themselves, nor are fruitive action, culture of knowledge or perfection in mystic powers ends in themselves. They are all means to attain to the highest stage of svarüpa, to render one's constitutional transcendental service to the Lord. Each and every living being has his individual position in one of the above-mentioned five different kinds of reciprocating means with the Lord, and in one's pure spiritual form of svarüpa the relation becomes manifest without mundane affinity. The kissing of the Lord, either by His wives or His young girlfriends who aspired to have the Lord as their fiancé, is not of any mundane perverted quality. Had such things been mundane, a liberated soul like Çukadeva would not have taken the trouble to relish them, nor would Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu have been inclined to participate in those subjects after renouncing worldly life. The stage is earned after many lives of penance.
TEXT 29
yä vérya-çulkena håtäù svayaàvare
pramathya caidya-pramukhän hi çuñmiëaù
pradyumna-sämbämba-sutädayo 'parä
yäç cähåtä bhauma-vadhe sahasraçaù


yä—the lady; vérya—prowess; çulkena—by payment of the price; håtäù—taken away by force; svayaàvare—in the open selection of the bridegroom; pramathya—harassing; caidya—King Çiçupäla; pramukhän—headed by; hi—positively; çuñmiëaù—all very powerful; pradyumna—Pradyumna (Kåñëa's son); sämba—Sämba; amba—Amba; suta-ädayaù—children; aparäù—other ladies; yäù—those; ca—also; ähåtäù—similarly brought; bhauma-vadhe—after killing Bhaumäsura; sahasraçaù—by the thousands.

The children of these ladies are Pradyumna, Sämba, Amba, etc. Ladies like Rukmiëé, Satyabhämä and Jämbavaté were forcibly taken away by Him from their svayaàvara ceremonies after He defeated many powerful kings, headed by Çiçupäla. And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed Bhaumäsura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.

PURPORT
Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called svayaàvara, or personal selection of the bridegroom. Because the svayaàvara was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princess, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. But it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy princess for whom so many princes died. Rukmiëé, the principal queen of Lord Kåñëa, was the daughter of the King of Vidarbha, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord Kåñëa. But her eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King Çiçupäla, who happened to be a cousin of Kåñëa. So there was open competition, and as usual Lord Kåñëa emerged successful, after harassing Çiçupäla and other princes by His unrivalled prowess. Rukmiëé had ten sons, like Pradyumna. There were other queens also taken away by Lord Kåñëa in a similar way. A full description of this beautiful booty of Lord Kåñëa will be given in the Tenth Canto. There were 16, 100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings and were forcibly stolen by Bhaumäsura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord Kåñëa for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaumäsura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives, although in the estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful Lord Kåñëa accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with the adoration of queens. So altogether Lord Kåñëa had 16, 108 queens at Dvärakä, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these children grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate of the family numbered 10,000,000.

etäù—all these women; param—highest; strétvam—womanhood; apästapeçalam—without independence; nirasta—without; çaucam—purity; bata sädhu—auspiciously glorified; kurvate—do they make; yäsäm—from whose; gåhät—homes; puñkara-locanaù—the lotus-eyed; patiù—husband; na jätu—never at any time; apaiti—goes away; ähåtibhiù—by presentation; hådi—in the heart; spåçan—endeared.

All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being without independence or purity. Their husband, the lotus-eyed Personality of Godhead, never left them alone at home. He always pleased their hearts by making valuable presentations.

PURPORT
The devotees of the Lord are purified souls. As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them, and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature. There is no bodily disqualification of a devotee, just as there is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the filthy drain water when they are amalgamated. Women, merchants and laborers are not very intelligent, and thus it is very difficult for them to understand the science of God or to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. They are more materialistic, and less than them are the Kirätas, Hüëas, Ändhras, Pulindas, Pulkaças, Äbhéras, Kaìkas, Yavanas, Khasas, etc., but all of them can be delivered if they are properly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. By engagement in the service of the Lord, the designative disqualifications are removed, and as pure souls they become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God.
The fallen girls under the clutches of Bhaumäsura sincerely prayed to Lord Çré Kåñëa for their deliverance, and their sincerity of purpose made them at once pure by virtue of devotion. The Lord therefore accepted them as His wives, and thus their lives became glorified. Such auspicious glorification was still more glorified when the Lord played with them as the most devoted husband.
The Lord used to live with His 16, 108 wives constantly. He expanded Himself into 16, 108 plenary portions, and each and every one of them was the Lord Himself without deviation from the Original Personality. The çruti-mantra affirms that the Lord can expand Himself into many. As husband of so many wives, He pleased them all with presentations, even at a costly endeavor. He brought the pärijäta plant from heaven and implanted it at the palace of Satyabhämä, one of the principal queens. If, therefore, anyone desires the Lord to become one's husband, the Lord fulfills such desires in full.

TEXT 6
natäù sma te nätha sadäìghri-paìkajaà

natäù—bowed down; sma—we had done so; te—unto You; nätha—O Lord; sadä—always; aìghri-paìkajam—the lotus feet; viriïca—Brahmä, the first living being; vairiïcya—sons of Brahmä like Sanaka and Sanätana; sura-indra—the king of heaven; vanditam—worshiped by; paräyaëam—the supreme; kñemam—welfare; iha—in this life; icchatäm—one who so desires; param—the highest; na—never; yatra—wherein; kälaù—inevitable time; prabhavet—can exert its influence; paraù—transcendental; prabhuù—the Supreme Lord.

The citizens said: O Lord, You are worshiped by all demigods like Brahmä, the four Sanas and even the king of heaven. You are the ultimate rest for those who are really aspiring to achieve the highest benefit of life. You are the supreme transcendental Lord, and inevitable time cannot exert its influence upon You.
The Supreme Lord is Çré Kåñëa, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä, Brahma-saàhitä and other authorized Vedic literatures. No one is equal to or greater than Him, and that is the verdict of all scriptures. The influence of time and space is exerted upon the dependent living entities, who are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. The living entities are predominated Brahman, whereas the Supreme Lord is the predominating Absolute. As soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion, and thus we are put into the threefold miseries, as one is put into dense darkness. The clear consciousness of the cognizant living being is God consciousness, in which one bows down unto Him in all circumstances.

bhaväya—for welfare; naù—for us; tvam—Your Lordship; bhava—just become; viçva-bhävana—the creator of the universe; tvam—Your Lordship; eva—certainly; mätä—mother; atha—as also; suhåt—well-wisher; patiù—husband; pitä—father; tvam—Your Lordship; sat-guruù—spiritual master; naù—our; paramam—the supreme; ca—and; daivatam—worshipable Deity; yasya—whose; anuvåttyä—following in the footsteps; kåtinaù—successful; babhüvima—we have become.

O creator of the universe, You are our mother, well-wisher, Lord, father, spiritual master and worshipable Deity. By following in Your footsteps we have become successful in every respect. We pray, therefore, that You continue to bless us with Your mercy.
PURPORT
The all-good Personality of Godhead, being the creator of the universe, has His all-good plans for the good of all good living beings. The good living beings are advised by the Lord to follow His good advice, and by doing so they become successful in all spheres of life. There is no need to worship any deity but the Lord. The Lord is all-powerful, and if He is satisfied by our obedience unto His lotus feet, He is competent to bestow upon us all kinds of blessings for the successful execution of both our material and spiritual lives. For attaining spiritual existence, the human form is a chance for all to understand our eternal relation with God. Our relation with Him is eternal; it can be neither broken nor vanquished. It may be forgotten for the time being, but it can be revived also by the grace of the Lord, if we follow His injunctions, which are revealed in the scriptures of all times and all places.
TEXT 8
aho sa-näthä bhavatä sma yad vayaà
traiviñöapänäm api düra-darçanam

aho—oh, it is our good luck; sa-näthäù—to be under the protection of the master; bhavatä—by Your good self; sma—as we have become; yat vayam—as we are; traiviñöa-pänäm—by the demigods; api—also; düra-darçanam—very rarely seen; prema-smita—smiling with love; snigdha—affectionate; nirékñaëa-änanam—face looking in that mode; paçyema—let us look; rüpam—beauty; tava—Your; sarva—all; saubhagam—auspiciousness.

Oh, it is our good luck that we have come again today under Your protection by Your presence. Although Your Lordship is rarely visited even by the denizens of heaven, now it is possible for us to look upon Your smiling face, which is full of affectionate glances. We can now see Your transcendental form, full of all auspiciousness.

PURPORT
The Lord in His eternal personal form can be seen only by the pure devotees. The Lord is never impersonal. He is the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, possible by dint of devotional service to be visited face to face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets. When Brahmäjé and other demigods want to consult Lord Viñëu, the plenary portion of Lord Kåñëa, they have to wait on the shore of the ocean of milk, where Lord Viñëu is lying on the White Island (Çvetadvépa). This ocean of milk and the Çvetadvépa planet are the replica of Vaikuëöhaloka within the universe. Neither Brahmäjé nor the demigods like Indra can enter into this island of Çvetadvépa, but they can stand on the shore of the ocean of milk and transmit their message to Lord Viñëu, known as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. Therefore, the Lord is rarely seen by them, but the inhabitants of Dvärakä, because of their being pure devotees without any tinge of the material contamination of fruitive activities and empiric philosophical speculation, can see Him face to face by the grace of the Lord. This is the original state of the living entities and can be attained by reviving our natural and constitutional state of life, which is discovered by devotional service only.

O lotus-eyed Lord, whenever You go away to Mathurä-Våndävana or Hastinäpura to meet Your friends and relatives, every moment of Your absence seems like millions of years. O infallible one, at that time our eyes become useless, as if bereft of the sun.

PURPORT
We are all proud of our material senses for making experiments to determine the existence of God. But we forget that our senses are not absolute by themselves. They can only act under certain conditions. For example, our eyes. As long as the sunshine is there, our eyes are useful to a certain extent. But in the absence of sunshine, the eyes are useless. Lord Çré Kåñëa, being the primeval Lord, the Supreme Truth, is compared to the sun. Without Him all our knowledge is either false or partial. The opposite of the sun is the darkness, and similarly the opposite of Kåñëa is mäyä, or illusion. The devotees of the Lord can see everything in true perspective due to the light disseminated by Lord Kåñëa. By the grace of the Lord the pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance. Therefore, it is necessary that we must always be in the sight of Lord Kåñëa so that we can see both ourselves and the Lord with His different energies. As we cannot see anything in the absence of the sun, so also we cannot see anything, including our own self, without the factual presence of the Lord. Without Him all our knowledge is covered by illusion.

katham—how; vayam—we; nätha—O Lord; ciroñite—being abroad almost always; tvayi—by You; prasanna—satisfaction; dåñöyä—by the glance; akhila—universal; täpa—miseries; çoñaëam—vanquishing; jévema—shall be able to live; te—Your; sundara—beautiful; häsa—smiling; çobhitam—decorated; apaçyamänäù—without seeing; vadanam—face; manoharam—attractive; iti—thus; ca—and; udéritäù—speaking; väcaù—words; prajänäm—of the citizens; bhakta-vatsalaù—kind to the devotees; çåëvänaù—thus learning; anugraham—kindness; dåñöyä—by glances; vitanvan—distributing; präviçat—entered; puram—Dvärakäpuré.

O master, if You live abroad all the time, then we cannot look at Your attractive face, whose satisfied smiles vanquish all our sufferings. How can we exist without Your presence? 
Upon hearing their speeches, the Lord, who is very kind to the citizens and the devotees, entered the city of Dvärakä and acknowledged all their greetings by casting His transcendental glance over them.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa's attraction is so powerful that once being attracted by Him one cannot tolerate separation from Him. Why is this so? Because we are all eternally related with Him as the sunrays are eternally related with the sun disc. The sunrays are molecular parts of the solar radiation. Thus the sunrays and the sun cannot be separated. The separation by the cloud is temporary and artificial, and as soon as the cloud is cleared, the sunrays again display their natural effulgence in the presence of the sun. Similarly, the living entities, who are molecular parts of the whole spirit, are separated from the Lord by the artificial covering of mäyä, the illusory energy. This illusory energy, or the curtain of mäyä, has to be removed, and when it is so done, the living entity can see the Lord face to face, and all his miseries are at once removed. Every one of us wants to remove the miseries of life, but we do not know how to do it. The solution is given here, and it rests on us to assimilate it or not.

Song-1 Prayers by Srila Sukadeva Goswami (SB 2.4.12-24)

TEXT 12      
çré-çuka uväca
namaù parasmai puruñäya bhüyase
sad-udbhava-sthäna-nirodha-lélayä
gåhéta-çakti-tritayäya dehinäm
antarbhaväyänupalakñya-vartmane


çré-çukaù uväca—Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé said; namaù—offering obeisances; parasmai—the Supreme; puruñäya—Personality of Godhead; bhüyase—unto the complete whole; sad-udbhava—the creation of the material world; sthäna—its maintenance; nirodha—and its winding up; lélayä—by the pastime of; gåhéta—having accepted; çakti—power; tritayäya—three modes; dehinäm—of all who possess material bodies; antaù-bhaväya—unto Him who resides within; anupalakñya—inconceivable; vartmane—one who has such ways.

Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, for the creation of the material world, accepts the three modes of nature. He is the complete whole residing within the body of everyone, and His ways are inconceivable.

PURPORT
This material world is a manifestation of the three modes—goodness, passion and ignorance—and the Supreme Lord, for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world, accepts three predominating forms as Brahmä, Viñëu and Çaìkara (Çiva). As Viñëu He enters into every body materially created. As Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu He enters into every universe, and as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu He enters the body of every living being. Lord Çré Kåñëa, being the origin of all viñëu-tattvas, is addressed here as paraù pumän, or Puruñottama, as described in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.18). He is the complete whole. The puruñävatäras are therefore His plenary expansions. Bhakti-yoga is the only process by which one can become competent to know Him. Because the empiric philosophers and mystic yogés cannot conceive of the Personality of Godhead, He is called anupalakñya-vartmane, the Lord of the inconceivable way, or bhakti-yoga.
TEXT 13
bhüyo namaù sad-våjina-cchide 'satäm
asambhaväyäkhila-sattva-mürtaye
puàsäà punaù päramahaàsya äçrame
vyavasthitänäm anumågya-däçuñe


bhüyaù—again; namaù—my obeisances; sat—of the devotees or the pious; våjina—distresses; chide—the liberator; asatäm—of the atheists, the nondevotee demons; asambhaväya—cessation of further unhappiness; akhila—complete; sattva—goodness; mürtaye—unto the Personality; puàsäm—of the transcendentalists; punaù—again; päramahaàsye—the highest stage of spiritual perfection; äçrame—in the status; vyavasthitänäm—particularly situated; anumågya—the destination; däçuñe—one who delivers.

I again offer my respectful obeisances unto the form of complete existence and transcendence, who is the liberator of the pious devotees from all distresses and the destroyer of the further advances in atheistic temperament of the nondevotee demons. For the transcendentalists who are situated in the topmost spiritual perfection, He grants their specific destinations.

PURPORT
Lord Çré Kåñëa is the complete form of all existence, both material and spiritual. Akhila means complete, or that which is not khila, inferior. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, there are two kinds of nature (prakåti), namely the material nature and the spiritual nature, or the external and internal potencies of the Lord. The material nature is called aparä, or inferior, and the spiritual nature is called superior or transcendental. Therefore the form of the Lord is not of the inferior, material nature. He is complete transcendence. And He is mürti, or having transcendental form. The less intelligent men, who are unaware of His transcendental form, describe Him as impersonal Brahman. But Brahman is simply the rays of His transcendental body (yasya prabhä [Bs. 5.40]). The devotees, who are aware of His transcendental form, render Him service; therefore the Lord also reciprocates by His causeless mercy and thus delivers His devotees from all distresses. The pious men who follow the rulings of the Vedas are also dear to Him, and therefore the pious men of this world are also protected by Him. The impious and the nondevotees are against the principles of the Vedas, and so such persons are always hampered from making advances in their nefarious activities. Some of them, who are specially favored by the Lord, are killed by Him personally, as in the cases of Rävaëa, Hiraëyakaçipu and Kaàsa, and thus such demons get salvation and are thereby checked from further progress in their demoniac activities. Just like a kind father, either in His favor upon the devotees or His punishment of the demons He is ever kind to everyone because He is the complete existence for all individual existence.
The paramahaàsa stage of existence is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual values. According to Çrématé Kuntédevé, the Lord is factually understood by the paramahaàsas only. As there is gradual realization of the transcendence from impersonal Brahman to localized Paramätmä to the Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, Lord Kåñëa, similarly there is gradual promotion of one's situation in the spiritual life of sannyäsa. Kuöécaka, bahüdaka, parivräjakäcärya and paramahaàsa are gradual progressive stages in the renounced order of life, sannyäsa, and Queen Kuntédevé, the mother of the Päëòavas, has spoken about them in her prayers to Lord Kåñëa (Canto One, Chapter Eight). The paramahaàsas are generally found among both the impersonalists and the devotees, but according to Çrémad-Bhägavatam (as clearly stated by Kuntédevé), pure bhakti-yoga is understood by the paramahaàsas, and Kuntédevé has especially mentioned that the Lord descends (pariträëäya sädhünäm [Bg. 4.8]) especially to award bhakti-yoga to the paramahaàsas. So ultimately the paramahaàsas, in the true sense of the term, are unalloyed devotees of the Lord. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has directly accepted that the highest destination is bhakti-yoga, by which one renders transcendental loving service to the Lord. Those who accept the path of bhakti-yoga are the factual paramahaàsas.
Since the Lord is very kind to everyone, the impersonalists, who accept bhakti as the means of merging into the Lord's impersonal existence, the brahma-jyoti, are also awarded their desired destination. He has assured everyone in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.11): ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, there are two classes of paramahaàsas, namely the brahmänandés (impersonalists) and the premänandés (devotees), and both are awarded their desired destinations, although the premänandés are more fortunate than the brahmänandés. But both the brahmänandés and the premänandés are transcendentalists, and they have nothing to do with the inferior, material nature full of the existential miseries of life.
TEXT 14
namo namas te 'stv åñabhäya sätvatäà
vidüra-käñöhäya muhuù kuyoginäm
nirasta-sämyätiçayena rädhasä
sva-dhämani brahmaëi raàsyate namaù


namaù namaù te—let me offer my obeisances unto You; astu—are; åñabhäya—unto the great associate; sätvatäm—of the members of the Yadu dynasty; vidüra-käñöhäya—one who is far from mundane wranglers; muhuù—always; ku-yoginäm—of the nondevotees; nirasta—vanquished; sämya—equal status; atiçayena—by greatness; rädhasä—by opulence; sva-dhämani—in His own abode; brahmaëi—in the spiritual sky; raàsyate—enjoys; namaù—I do bow down.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Him who is the associate of the members of the Yadu dynasty and who is always a problem for the nondevotees. He is the supreme enjoyer of both the material and spiritual worlds, yet He enjoys His own abode in the spiritual sky. There is no one equal to Him because His transcendental opulence is immeasurable.

PURPORT
There are two sides of the transcendental manifestations of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa. For the pure devotees He is the constant companion, as in the case of His becoming one of the family members of the Yadu dynasty, or His becoming the friend of Arjuna, or His becoming the associate neighbor of the inhabitants of Våndävana, as the son of Nanda-Yaçodä, the friend of Sudämä, Çrédämä and Madhumaìgala, or the lover of the damsels of Vrajabhümi, etc. These are aspects of His personal feature. And by His impersonal feature He expands the rays of the brahma-jyoti, which is limitless and all-pervasive. Part of this all-pervasive brahma-jyoti, which is compared to the sunrays, is covered by the darkness of the mahat-tattva, and this insignificant part is known as the material world. In this material world there are innumerable universes like the one we can experience, and in each of them there are hundreds of thousands of planets like the one we are inhabiting. The mundaners are more or less captivated by the unlimited expansion of the rays of the Lord, but the devotees are concerned more with His personal form, from which everything is emanating (janmädy asya yataù [SB 1.1.1]). As the sunrays are concentrated in the sun disc, the brahma-jyoti is concentrated in Goloka Våndävana, the topmost spiritual planet in the spiritual sky. The immeasurable spiritual sky is full of spiritual planets, named Vaikuëöhas, far beyond the material sky. The mundaners have insufficient information of even the mundane sky, so what can they think of the spiritual sky? Therefore the mundaners are always far, far away from Him. With their tiny rockets they are having difficulty reaching even the nearest planet, the moon; therefore what can they conceive of the spiritual sky and the planets there? Even if in the future they are able to manufacture some machine whose speed may be accelerated to the velocity of the wind or mind, the mundaners will still be unable to imagine reaching the planets in the spiritual sky. So the Lord and His residential abode will always remain a myth or a mysterious problem for them, but for the devotees the Lord will always be available as an associate.
In the spiritual sky the Lord's opulence is immeasurable. He resides in all the spiritual planets, the innumerable Vaikuëöha planets, by expanding His plenary portions along with His liberated devotee associates, but the impersonalists who want to merge into the existence of the Lord are allowed to merge as one of the spiritual sparks of the brahma-jyoti. They have no qualifications for becoming associates of the Lord, either in the Vaikuëöha planets or in the supreme planet, Goloka Våndävana, described in the Bhagavad-gétä as mad-dhäma and here in this verse as the sva-dhäma of the Lord.
This mad-dhäma or sva-dhäma is described in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.6) as follows:
na tad bhäsayate süryo
na çaçäìko na pävakaù
yad gatvä na nivartante
tad dhäma paramaà mama
The Lord's sva-dhäma does not require any sunlight or moonlight or electricity for illumination. That dhäma, or place, is supreme, and whoever goes there never comes back to this material world.
The Vaikuëöha planets and the Goloka Våndävana planet are all self-illuminating, and the rays scattered by those sva-dhämas of the Lord constitute the existence of the brahma-jyoti. 
The self-illumination of the Lord's sva-dhäma is further confirmed in the Vedas, in the following verse found in the Muëòaka Upaniñad (2.2.10), Kaöha Upaniñad (2.2.15) and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (6.14):
na tatra süryo bhäti na candra-tärakaà
nemä vidyuto bhänti kuto 'yam agniù
tam eva bhäntam anu bhäti sarvaà
tasya bhäsä sarvam idaà vibhäti
In the sva-dhäma of the Lord there is no need of sun, moon or stars for illumination. Nor is there need of electricity, so what to speak of ignited lamps? On the other hand, it is because those planets are self-illuminating that all effulgence has become possible, and whatever there is that is dazzling is due to the reflection of that sva-dhäma.
One who is dazzled by the effulgence of the impersonal brahma-jyoti cannot know the personal transcendence; therefore in the Éçopaniñad (15) it is prayed that the Lord remove His dazzling effulgence so that the devotee can see His real reality. It is spoken thus:
hiraëmayena pätreëa
satyasyäpihitaà mukham
tat tvaà püñann apävåëu
satya-dharmäya dåñöaye
"O Lord, You are the maintainer of everything, both material and spiritual, and everything flourishes by Your mercy. Your devotional service, or bhakti-yoga, is the actual principle of religion, satya-dharma, and I am engaged in that service. So kindly protect me by showing Your real face. Please, therefore, remove the veil of Your brahma-jyoti rays so that I can see Your form of eternal bliss and knowledge."
TEXT 15
yat-kértanaà yat-smaraëaà yad-ékñaëaà
yad-vandanaà yac-chravaëaà yad-arhaëam
lokasya sadyo vidhunoti kalmañaà
tasmai subhadra-çravase namo namaù


yat—whose; kértanam—glorification; yat—whose; smaraëam—remembrances; yat—whose; ékñaëam—audience; yat—whose; vandanam—prayers; yat—whose; çravaëam—hearing about; yat—whose; arhaëam—worshiping; lokasya—of all people; sadyaù—forthwith; vidhunoti—specifically cleanses; kalmañam—effects of sins; tasmai—unto Him; subhadra—all-auspicious; çravase—one who is heard; namaù namaù—my due obeisances again and again.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-auspicious Lord Çré Kåñëa, about whom glorification, remembrances, audience, prayers, hearing and worship can at once cleanse the effects of all sins of the performer.

PURPORT
The sublime form of religious performances to free oneself from all reactions of sins is suggested herein by the greatest authority, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé. Kértanam, or glorifying the Lord, can be performed in very many ways, such as remembering, visiting temples to see the Deity, offering prayers in front of the Lord, and hearing recitations of glorification of the Lord as they are mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam or in the Bhagavad-gétä. Kértanam can be performed both by singing the glories of the Lord in accompaniment with melodious music and by recitation of scriptures like Çrémad-Bhägavatam or Bhagavad-gétä.
The devotees need not be disappointed in the physical absence of the Lord, thinking they are not associating with Him. The devotional processes of chanting, hearing, remembering, etc., (either all or some of them, or even one of them) can give us the desired result of associating with the Lord by discharging the transcendental loving service of the Lord in the above manner. Even the very sound of the holy name of Lord Kåñëa or Räma can at once surcharge the atmosphere spiritually. We must know definitely that the Lord is present wherever such pure transcendental service is performed, and thus the performer of offenseless kértanam has positive association with the Lord. Similarly, remembrance and prayers also can give us the desired result if they are properly done under expert guidance. One should not concoct forms of devotional service. One may worship the form of the Lord in a temple, or one may impersonally offer the Lord devotional prayers in a mosque or a church. One is sure to get free from the reactions of sins, provided one is very careful about not committing sins willingly in expectation of getting free from the reactions of sins by worshiping in the temple or by offering prayers in the church. This mentality of committing sins willfully on the strength of devotional service is called nämno baläd yasya hi päpa-buddhiù, and it is the greatest offense in the discharge of devotional service. Hearing, therefore, is essential in order to keep oneself strictly on guard against such pitfalls of sins. And in order to give special stress to the hearing process, the Gosvämé invokes all auspicious fortune in this matter.
TEXT 16
vicakñaëä yac-caraëopasädanät
saìgaà vyudasyobhayato 'ntar-ätmanaù
vindanti hi brahma-gatià gata-klamäs
tasmai subhadra-çravase namo namaù


vicakñaëäù—highly intellectual; yat—whose; caraëa-upasädanät—simply dedicating oneself unto the lotus feet; saìgam—attachment; vyudasya—giving up completely; ubhayataù—for present and future existence; antaù-ätmanaù—of the heart and soul; vindanti—moves progressively; hi—certainly; brahma-gatim—toward spiritual existence; gata-klamäù—without difficulty; tasmai—unto Him; subhadra—all-auspicious; çravase—unto one who is heard; namaù namaù—my due obeisances again and again.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances again and again unto the all-auspicious Lord Çré Kåñëa. The highly intellectual, simply by surrendering unto His lotus feet, are relieved of all attachments to present and future existences and without difficulty progress toward spiritual existence.

PURPORT
Lord Çré Kåñëa has repeatedly instructed Arjuna, or for that matter everyone concerned with becoming His unalloyed devotee. In the last phase of His instruction in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.64-66) He instructed most confidentially as follows:
sarva-guhyatamaà bhüyaù
çåëu me paramaà vacaù
iñöo 'si me dåòham iti
tato vakñyämi te hitam
man-manä bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru
mäm evaiñyasi satyaà te
pratijäne priyo 'si me
sarva-dharmän parityajya
mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja
ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo
mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù
"My dear Arjuna, you are very dear to Me, and therefore only for your good I will disclose the most secret part of My instructions. It is simply this: become a pure devotee of Mine and give yourself unto Me only, and I promise you full spiritual existence, by which you may gain the eternal right of transcendental loving service unto Me. Just give up all other ways of religiosity and exclusively surrender unto Me and believe that I will protect you from your sinful acts, and I shall deliver you. Do not worry any more."
Persons who are intelligent take serious notice of this last instruction of the Lord. Knowledge of the self is the first step in spiritual realization, which is called confidential knowledge, and a step further is God realization, which is called more confidential knowledge. The culmination of the knowledge of the Bhagavad-gétä is God realization, and when one attains this stage of God realization, he naturally, voluntarily becomes a devotee of the Lord to render Him loving transcendental service. This devotional service to the Lord is always based on love of God and is distinct from the nature of routine service as prescribed in karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga or dhyäna-yoga. In the Bhagavad-gétä there are different instructions for men of different categories, and there are various descriptions for varëäçrama-dharma, sannyäsa-dharma, yati-dharma, the renounced order of life, controlling the senses, meditation, perfection of mystic powers, etc., but one who fully surrenders unto the Lord to render service unto Him, out of spontaneous love for Him, factually assimilates the essence of all knowledge described in the Vedas. One who adopts this method very skillfully attains perfection of life at once. And this perfection of human life is called brahma-gati, or the progressive march in spiritual existence. As enunciated by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé on the basis of Vedic assurances, brahma-gati means to attain a spiritual form as good as that of the Lord, and in that form the liberated living being eternally lives on one of the spiritual planets situated in the spiritual sky. Attainment of this perfection of life is easily available to a pure devotee of the Lord without his undergoing any difficult method of perfection. Such a devotional life is full of kértanam, smaraëam, ékñaëam, etc., as mentioned in the previous verse. One must therefore adopt this simple way of devotional life in order to attain the highest perfection available in any category of the human form of life in any part of the world. When Lord Brahmä met Lord Kåñëa as a playful child at Våndävana, he offered his prayer in which he said:
çreyaù-såtià bhaktim udasya te vibho
kliçyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
teñäm asau kleçala eva çiñyate
nänyad yathä sthüla-tuñävaghätinäm
(SB 10.14.4)
Bhakti-yoga, the highest quality of perfection, is to be achieved by the intelligent person in lieu of performing a large quantity of spiritual activities. The example cited here is very appropriate. A handful of real paddy is more valuable than heaps of paddy skins without any substance within. Similarly, one should not be attracted by the jugglery of karma-käëòa or jïäna-käëòa or even the gymnastic performances of yoga, but skillfully should take to the simple performances of kértanam, smaraëam, etc., under a bona fide spiritual master, and without any difficulty attain the highest perfection.
TEXT 17
tapasvino däna-parä yaçasvino
manasvino mantra-vidaù sumaìgaläù
kñemaà na vindanti vinä yad-arpaëaà

tapasvinaù—the great learned sages; däna-paräù—the great performer of charity; yaçasvinaù—the great worker of distinction; manasvinaù—the great philosophers or mystics; mantra-vidaù—the great chanter of the Vedic hymns; su-maìgaläù—strict followers of Vedic principles; kñemam—fruitful result; na—never; vindanti—attain; vinä—without; yat-arpaëam—dedication; tasmai—unto Him; subhadra—auspicious; çravase—hearing about Him; namaù namaù—my obeisances again and again.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-auspicious Lord Çré Kåñëa again and again because the great learned sages, the great performers of charity, the great workers of distinction, the great philosophers and mystics, the great chanters of the Vedic hymns and the great followers of Vedic principles cannot achieve any fruitful result without dedication of such great qualities to the service of the Lord.

PURPORT
Advancement of learning, a charitable disposition, political, social or religious leadership of human society, philosophical speculations, the practice of the yoga system, expertise in the Vedic rituals, and all similar high qualities in man serve one in the attainment of perfection only when they are employed in the service of the Lord. Without such dovetailing, all such qualities become sources of trouble for people in general. Everything can be utilized either for one's own sense gratification or in the service of one other than oneself. There are two kinds of self-interest also, namely personal selfishness and extended selfishness. But there is no qualitative difference between personal and extended selfishness. Theft for personal interest or for the family interest is of the same quality—namely, criminal. A thief pleading not guilty because of committing theft not for personal interest but for the interest of society or country has never been excused by the established law of any country. People in general have no knowledge that the self-interest of a living being attains perfection only when such an interest coincides with the interest of the Lord. For example, what is the interest of maintaining body and soul together? One earns money for maintenance of the body (personal or social), but unless there is God consciousness, unless the body is being properly maintained to realize one's relation with God, all good efforts to maintain body and soul together are similar to the attempts of the animals to maintain body and soul together. The purpose of maintaining the human body is different from that of the animals. Similarly, advancement of learning, economic development, philosophical research, study of the Vedic literature, or even the execution of pious activities (like charity, opening of hospitals, and the distribution of food grains) should be done in relation with the Lord. The aim of all such acts and endeavors must be the pleasure of the Lord and not the satisfaction of any other identity, individual or collective (saàsiddhir hari-toñaëam [SB 1.2.13]). The same principle is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.27), where it is said that whatever we may give in charity and whatever we may observe in austerity must be given over to the Lord or be done on His account only. The expert leaders of a godless human civilization cannot bring about a fruitful result in any of their different attempts at educational advancement or economic development unless they are God conscious. And to become God conscious one has to hear about the all-auspicious Lord, as He is described in literature like the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

Kirätas, Hüëas, Ändhras, Pulindas, Pulkaças, Äbhéras, Çumbhas, Yavanas, members of the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

PURPORT
Kiräta: A province of old Bhärata-varña mentioned in the Bhéñma-parva of the Mahäbhärata. Generally the Kirätas are known as the aboriginal tribes of India, and in modern days the Santal Parganas in Bihar and Chota Nagpur might comprise the old province named Kiräta.
Hüëa: The area of East Germany and part of Russia is known as the province of the Hüëas. Accordingly, sometimes a kind of hill tribe is known as the Hüëas.
Ändhra: A province in southern India mentioned in the Bhéñma-parva of the Mahäbhärata. It is still extant under the same name.
Pulinda: It is mentioned in the Mahäbhärata (Sabhä-parva 26.10), viz., the inhabitants of the province of the name Pulinda. This country was conquered by Bhémasena and Sahadeva. The Greeks are known as Pulindas, and it is mentioned in the Vana-parva of Mahäbhärata that the non-Vedic race of this part of the world would rule over the world. This Pulinda province was also one of the provinces of Bhärata, and the inhabitants were classified amongst the kñatriya kings. But later on, due to their giving up the brahminical culture, they were mentioned as mlecchas (just as those who are not followers of the Islamic culture are called kafirs and those who are not followers of the Christian culture are called heathens).
Äbhéra: This name also appears in the Mahäbhärata, both in the Sabhä-parva and Bhéñma-parva. It is mentioned that this province was situated on the river Sarasvaté in Sind. The modern Sind province formerly extended to the other side of the Arabian Sea, and all the inhabitants of that province were known as the Äbhéras. They were under the domination of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, and according to the statements of Märkaëòeya the mlecchas of this part of the world would also rule over Bhärata. Later on this proved to be true, as in the case of the Pulindas. On behalf of the Pulindas, Alexander the Great conquered India, and on behalf of the Äbhéras, Muhammad Ghori conquered India. These Äbhéras were also formerly kñatriyas within the brahminical culture, but they gave up the connection. The kñatriyas who were afraid of Paraçuräma and had hidden themselves in the Caucasian hilly regions later on became known as the Äbhéras, and the place they inhabited was known as Äbhéradeça.
Çumbhas or Kaìkas: The inhabitants of the Kaìka province of old Bhärata, mentioned in the Mahäbhärata.
Yavanas: Yavana was the name of one of the sons of Mahäräja Yayäti who was given the part of the world known as Turkey to rule. Therefore the Turks are Yavanas due to being descendants of Mahäräja Yavana. The Yavanas were therefore kñatriyas, and later on, by giving up the brahminical culture, they became mleccha-yavanas. Descriptions of the Yavanas are in the Mahäbhärata. A prince called Turvasu was also known as a Yavana (Ädi-parva 80.26), and his country was conquered by Sahadeva, one of the Päëòavas. The western Yavanas joined with Duryodhana in the Battle of Kurukñetra under the pressure of Karëa. It was foretold that these Yavanas would conquer India, and it proved to be true.
Khasa: The inhabitants of the Khasadeça are mentioned in the Mahäbhärata (Droëa-parva). Those who have a stunted growth of hair on the upper lip are generally called Khasas. As such, the Khasas are the Mongolians, the Chinese and others who are so designated.
The above-mentioned historical names are different nations of the world. Even those who are constantly engaged in sinful acts are all corrigible to the standard of perfect human beings if they take shelter of the devotees of the Lord. Jesus Christ and Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe. And from the version of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general. The politicians of the world may remain in their respective positions because the pure devotees of the Lord are not interested in political leadership or diplomatic implications. The devotees are interested only in seeing that the people in general are not misguided by political propaganda and in seeing that the valuable life of a human being is not spoiled in following a type of civilization which is ultimately doomed. If the politicians, therefore, would be guided by the good counsel of the devotees, then certainly there would be a great change in the world situation by the purifying propaganda of the devotees, as shown by Lord Caitanya. As Çukadeva Gosvämé began one of his prayers with the words yat-kértanam, so also Lord Caitanya recommended that simply by glorification of the Lord's holy name a tremendous change of heart can take place, by which the complete misunderstanding between the human nations created by politicians can at once be extinguished. And after the extinction of the fire of misunderstanding, other profits will follow. The destination is to go back home, back to Godhead, as we have several times discussed in these pages.
According to the cult of devotion, generally known as the Vaiñëava cult, there is no bar against anyone's advancing in the matter of God realization. A Vaiñëava is powerful enough to turn into Vaiñëavas even the Kirätas, etc., as above mentioned. In the Bhagavad-gétä (9.32) it is said by the Lord that there is no bar to becoming a devotee of the Lord (even for those who are lowborn, or for women, çüdras or vaiçyas), and whoever becomes a devotee is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The only qualification is that one take shelter of a pure devotee of the Lord who has thorough knowledge of the transcendental science of Kåñëa (the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam). Anyone from any part of the world who becomes well conversant in the science of Kåñëa becomes a pure devotee and a spiritual master for the general mass of people and may reclaim them by purification of the heart. Though a person be even the most sinful man, he can at once be purified by systematic contact with a pure Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava, therefore, can accept a bona fide disciple from any part of the world without any consideration of caste and creed and promote him by regulative principles to the status of a pure Vaiñëava, who is transcendental to brahminical culture. The system of caste, or varëäçrama-dharma, is no longer regular even amongst the so-called followers of the system. Nor is it now possible to reestablish the institutional function in the present context of social, political and economic revolution. Without any reference to the particular custom of a country, one can be accepted into the Vaiñëava cult spiritually, and there is no hindrance in the transcendental process. So by the order of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, the cult of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and the Bhagavad-gétä can be preached all over the world, reclaiming all persons willing to accept the transcendental cult. Such cultural propaganda by the devotees will certainly be accepted by all persons who are reasonable and inquisitive, without any particular bias for the custom of the country. The Vaiñëava never accepts another Vaiñëava on the basis of birthright, just as he never thinks of the Deity of the Lord in a temple as an idol. And to remove all doubts in this connection, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé has invoked the blessings of the Lord, who is all-powerful (prabhaviñëave namaù). Just as stone, wood or metal is transcendentally changed when the all-powerful Lord, in His form as the worshipable Deity in the temple, accepts the humble service of His devotee in the devotional activities of arcana, so the body of a pure Vaiñëava at once changes transcendentally when he gives himself up to the service of the Lord and is trained by a qualified Vaiñëava. The injunction of the Vaiñëava regulations in this connection runs as follows: arcye viñëau çilä-dhér guruñu nara-matir vaiñëave jäti-buddhiù/ . . . çré-viñëor nämni mantre . . . çabda-sämänya-buddhiù, etc. "One should not consider the Deity of the Lord as worshiped in the temple to be an idol, nor should one consider the authorized spiritual master an ordinary man. Nor should one consider a pure Vaiñëava to belong to a particular caste, nor should one consider the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra a material sound vibration, etc."  (Padma Puräëa)
The conclusion is that the Lord, being all-powerful, can, under any and every circumstance, accept anyone from any part of the world, either personally or through His bona fide manifestation as the spiritual master. Lord Caitanya accepted many devotees from communities other than the varëäçramites, and He Himself declared, to teach us, that He does not belong to any caste or social order of life, but that He is the eternal servant of the servant of the Lord who maintains the damsels of Våndävana (Lord Kåñëa) [Cc. Madhya 13.80]. That is the way of self-realization.

saù—He; eñaù—it is; ätmä—the Supersoul; ätmavatäm—of the self-realized souls; adhéçvaraù—the Supreme Lord; trayé-mayaù—personified Vedas; dharma-mayaù—personified religious scripture; tapaù-mayaù—personified austerity; gata-vyalékaiù—by those who are above all pretensions; aja—Brahmäjé; çaìkara-ädibhiù—by Lord Çiva and others; vitarkya-liìgaù—one who is observed with awe and veneration; bhagavän—the Personality of Godhead; prasédatäm—be kind toward me.

He is the Supersoul and the Supreme Lord of all self-realized souls. He is the personification of the Vedas, religious scriptures and austerities. He is worshiped by Lord Brahmä and Çiva and all those who are transcendental to all pretensions. Being so revered with awe and veneration, may that Supreme Absolute be pleased with me.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, although the Lord of all followers of different paths of self-realization, is knowable only by those who are above all pretensions. Everyone is searching for eternal peace or eternal life, and with an aim to this destination everyone is either studying the Vedic scriptures or other religious scriptures or undergoing severe austerity as empiric philosophers, as mystic yogés or as unalloyed devotees, etc. But the Supreme Lord is perfectly realized only by the devotees because they are above all pretensions. Those who are on the path of self-realization are generally classified as karmés, jïänés, yogés or devotees of the Lord. The karmés, who are much attracted by the fruitive activities of the Vedic rituals, are called bhukti-kämés, or those who desire material enjoyment. The jïänés, who try to become one with the Supreme by mental speculation, are called mukti-kämés, or those who desire liberation from material existence. The mystic yogés, who practice different types of austerities for attainment of eight kinds of material perfection and who ultimately meet the Supersoul (Paramätmä) in trance, are called siddhi-kämés, or those who desire the perfection of becoming finer than the finest, becoming heavier than the heaviest, getting everything desired, having control over everyone, creating everything liked, etc. All these are abilities of a powerful yogé. But the devotees of the Lord do not want anything like that for self-satisfaction. They want only to serve the Lord because the Lord is great and as living entities they are eternally subordinate parts and parcels of the Lord. This perfect realization of the self by the devotee helps him to become desireless, to desire nothing for his personal self, and thus the devotees are called niñkämé, without any desire. A living entity, by his constitutional position, cannot be void of all desires (the bhukti-kämés, mukti-kämés and siddhi-kämés all desire something for personal satisfaction), but the niñkämé devotees of the Lord desire everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. They are completely dependent on the orders of the Lord and are always ready to discharge their duty for the satisfaction of the Lord.
In the beginning Arjuna placed himself as one of those who desire self-satisfaction, for he desired not to fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra, but to make him desireless the Lord preached the Bhagavad-gétä, in which the ways of karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, haöha-yoga and also bhakti-yoga were explained. Because Arjuna was without any pretension, he changed his decision and satisfied the Lord by agreeing to fight (kariñye vacanaà tava) [Bg. 18.73], and thus he became desireless.
The examples of Brahmä and Lord Çiva are specifically cited here because Brahmäjé, Lord Çiva, Çrématé Lakñméjé and the four Kumäras (Sanaka, Sanätana, etc.) are leaders of the four desireless Vaiñëava sampradäyas. They are all freed from all pretensions. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé interprets the word gata-vyalékaiù as projjhita-kaitavaiù, or those who are freed from all pretensions (the unalloyed devotees only). In the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 19.149) it is said:
kåñëa-bhakta—niñkäma, ataeva 'çänta'
bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kämé, sakali 'açänta'
Those who are after fruitive results for their pious activities, those who desire salvation and identity with the Supreme, and those who desire material perfections of mystic power are all restless because they want something for themselves, but the devotee is completely peaceful because he has no demand for himself and is always ready to serve the desire of the Lord. The conclusion is, therefore, that the Lord is for everyone because no one can achieve the result of his respective desires without His sanction, but as stated by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gétä (8.9), all such results are awarded by Him only, for the Lord is adhéçvara (the original controller) of everyone, namely the Vedäntists, the great karma-käëòéyas, the great religious leaders, the great performers of austerity and all who are striving for spiritual advancement. But ultimately He is realized by the pretensionless devotees only. Therefore special stress is given to the devotional service of the Lord by Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé.

çriyaù—all opulence; patiù—the owner; yajïa—of sacrifice; patiù—the director; prajä-patiù—the leader of all living entities; dhiyäm—of intelligence; patiù—the master; loka-patiù—the proprietor of all planets; dharä—earth; patiù—the supreme; patiù—head; gatiù—destination; ca—also; andhaka—one of the kings of the Yadu dynasty; våñëi—the first king of the Yadu dynasty; sätvatäm—the Yadus; prasédatäm—be merciful; me—upon me; bhagavän—Lord Çré Kåñëa; satäm—of all devotees; patiù—the Lord.

May Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is the worshipable Lord of all devotees, the protector and glory of all the kings like Andhaka and Våñëi of the Yadu dynasty, the husband of all goddesses of fortune, the director of all sacrifices and therefore the leader of all living entities, the controller of all intelligence, the proprietor of all planets, spiritual and material, and the supreme incarnation on the earth (the supreme all in all), be merciful upon me.

PURPORT
Since Çukadeva Gosvämé is one of the prominent gata-vyalékas, those who are freed from all misconceptions, he therefore expresses his own realized perception of Lord Çré Kåñëa as being the sum total of all perfection, the Personality of Godhead. Everyone is seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune, but people do not know that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the beloved husband of all goddesses of fortune. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that the Lord, in His transcendental abode Goloka Våndävana, is accustomed to herding the surabhi cows and is served there by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune. All these goddesses of fortune are manifestations of His transcendental pleasure potency (hlädiné-çakti) in His internal energy, and when the Lord manifested Himself on this earth He partially displayed the activities of His pleasure potency in His räsa-lélä just to attract the conditioned souls, who are all after the phantasmagoria pleasure potency in degraded sex enjoyment. The pure devotees of the Lord like Çukadeva Gosvämé, who was completely detached from the abominable sex life of the material world, discussed this act of the Lord's pleasure potency certainly not in relation to sex, but to relish a transcendental taste inconceivable to the mundaners who are after sex life. Sex life in the mundane world is the root cause of being conditioned by the shackles of illusion, and certainly Çukadeva Gosvämé was never interested in the sex life of the mundane world. Nor does the manifestation of the Lord's pleasure potency have any connection with such degraded things. Lord Caitanya was a strict sannyäsé, so much so that He did not allow any woman to come near Him, not even to bow down and offer respects. He never even heard the prayers of the deva-däsés offered in the temple of Jagannätha because a sannyäsé is forbidden to hear songs sung by the fair sex. Yet even in the rigid position of a sannyäsé He recommended the mode of worship preferred by the gopés of Våndävana as the topmost loving service possible to be rendered to the Lord. And Çrématé Rädhäräëé is the principal head of all such goddesses of fortune, and therefore She is the pleasure counterpart of the Lord and is nondifferent from Kåñëa.
In the Vedic rituals there are recommendations for performing different types of sacrifice in order to achieve the greatest benefit in life. The benedictions that result from performing great sacrifices are, after all, favors given by the goddess of fortune, and the Lord, being the husband or lover of the goddess of fortune, is factually the Lord of all sacrifices also. He is the final enjoyer of all kinds of yajïa; therefore Yajïa-pati is another name of Lord Viñëu. It is recommended in the Bhagavad-gétä that everything be done for the Yajïa-pati (yajïärthät karmaëaù) because otherwise one's acts will be the cause of conditioning by the laws of material nature. Those who are not freed from all misconceptions (vyalékam) perform sacrifices to please the minor demigods, but the devotees of the Lord know very well that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the supreme enjoyer of all performances of sacrifice; therefore they perform the saìkértana-yajïa (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]), which is especially recommended in this Age of Kali. In Kali-yuga, performance of other types of sacrifice is not feasible due to insufficient arrangements and inexpert priesthood.
We have information from the Bhagavad-gétä (3.10–11) that Lord Brahmä, after giving rebirth to the conditioned souls within the universe, instructed them to perform sacrifices and to lead a prosperous life. With such sacrificial performances the conditioned souls will never be in difficulty in keeping body and soul together. Ultimately they can purify their existence. They will find natural promotion into spiritual existence, the real identity of the living being. Under no circumstances should a conditioned soul ever give up the practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity. The aim of all such sacrifices is to please the Yajïa-pati, the Personality of Godhead; therefore the Lord is also Prajä-pati. According to the Kaöha Upaniñad, the one Lord is the leader and maintainer of the innumerable living entities (eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän). The Lord is therefore called the supreme Bhüta-bhåt, or maintainer of all living beings.
Living beings are proportionately endowed with intelligence in terms of their previous activities. All living beings are not equally endowed with the same quality of intelligence because behind such development of intelligence is the control of the Lord, as declared in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15). As Paramätmä, the Supersoul, the Lord is living in everyone's heart, and from Him only does one's power of remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness follow (mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca). One person can sharply remember past activities by the grace of the Lord, while others cannot. One person is highly intelligent by the grace of the Lord, and another is a fool by the same control. Therefore the Lord is Dhiyäm-pati, or the Lord of intelligence.
The conditioned souls strive to become lords of the material world. Everyone is trying to lord it over the material nature by applying his highest degree of intelligence. This misuse of intelligence by the conditioned soul is called madness. One's full intelligence should be applied to get free from the material clutches. But the conditioned soul, due to madness only, engages his full energy and intelligence in sense gratification, and to achieve this end of life he willfully commits all sorts of misdeeds. The result is that instead of attaining an unconditional life of full freedom, the mad conditioned soul is entangled again and again in different types of bondage in material bodies. Everything we see in the material manifestation is but the creation of the Lord. Therefore He is the real proprietor of everything in the universes. The conditioned soul can enjoy a fragment of this material creation under the control of the Lord, but not self-sufficiently. That is the instruction in the Éçopaniñad. One should be satisfied with things awarded by the Lord of the universe. It is out of madness only that one tries to encroach upon another's share of material possessions.
The Lord of the universe, out of His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls, descends by His own energy (ätma-mäyä) to reestablish the eternal relation of the conditioned souls with Him. He instructs all to surrender unto Him instead of falsely claiming to be enjoyers for a certain limit under His control. When He so descends He proves how much greater is His ability to enjoy, and He exhibits His power of enjoyment by (for instance) marrying sixteen thousand wives at once. The conditioned soul is very proud of becoming the husband of even one wife, but the Lord laughs at this; the intelligent man can know who is the real husband. Factually, the Lord is the husband of all the women in His creation, but a conditioned soul under the control of the Lord feels proud to be the husband of one or two wives.
All these qualifications as the different types of pati mentioned in this verse are meant for Lord Çré Kåñëa, and Çukadeva Gosvämé has therefore especially mentioned the pati and gati of the Yadu dynasty. The members of the Yadu dynasty knew that Lord Çré Kåñëa is everything, and all of them intended to return to Lord Kåñëa after He had finished His transcendental pastimes on the earth. The Yadu dynasty was annihilated by the will of the Lord because its members had to return home with the Lord. The annihilation of the Yadu dynasty was a material show created by the Supreme Lord; otherwise the Lord and the members of the Yadu dynasty are all eternal associates. The Lord is therefore the guide of all devotees, and as such, Çukadeva Gosvämé offered Him due respects with love-laden feelings.

yat-aìghri—whose lotus feet; abhidhyäna—thinking of, at every second; samädhi—trance; dhautayä—being washed off; dhiyä—by such clean intelligence; anupaçyanti—does see by following authorities; hi—certainly; tattvam—the Absolute Truth; ätmanaù—of the Supreme Lord and of oneself; vadanti—they say; ca—also; etat—this; kavayaù—philosophers or learned scholars; yathä-rucam—as he thinks; saù—He; me—mine; mukundaù—Lord Kåñëa (who gives liberation); bhagavän—the Personality of Godhead; prasédatäm—be pleased with me.

It is the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa who gives liberation. By thinking of His lotus feet at every second, following in the footsteps of authorities, the devotee in trance can see the Absolute Truth. The learned mental speculators, however, think of Him according to their whims. May the Lord be pleased with me.

PURPORT
The mystic yogés, after a strenuous effort to control the senses, may be situated in a trance of yoga just to have a vision of the Supersoul within everyone, but the pure devotee, simply by remembering the Lord's lotus feet at every second, at once becomes established in real trance because by such realization his mind and intelligence are completely cleansed of the diseases of material enjoyment. The pure devotee thinks himself fallen into the ocean of birth and death and incessantly prays to the Lord to lift him up. He only aspires to become a speck of transcendental dust at the lotus feet of the Lord. The pure devotee, by the grace of the Lord, absolutely loses all attraction for material enjoyment, and to keep free from contamination he always thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord. King Kulaçekhara, a great devotee of the Lord, prayed:
kåñëa tvadéya-pada-paìkaja-païjaräntam
adyaiva me viçatu mänasa-räja-haàsaù
präëa-prayäëa-samaye kapha-väta-pittaiù
kaëöhävarodhana-vidhau smaraëaà kutas te
"My Lord Kåñëa, I pray that the swan of my mind may immediately sink down to the stems of the lotus feet of Your Lordship and be locked in their network; otherwise at the time of my final breath, when my throat is choked up with cough, how will it be possible to think of You?" (Mukunda-mälä-stotra 33)
There is an intimate relationship between the swan and the lotus stem. So the comparison is very appropriate: without becoming a swan, or paramahaàsa, one cannot enter into the networked stems of the lotus feet of the Lord. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä, the mental speculators, even by dint of learned scholarship, cannot even dream of the Absolute Truth by speculating over it for eternity. The Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to such mental speculators. And because they cannot enter into the networked stems of the lotus feet of the Lord, all mental speculators differ in their conclusions, and at the end they make a useless compromise by saying, "as many conclusions, as many ways," according to one's own inclination (yathä-rucam). But the Lord is not like a shopkeeper trying to please all sorts of customers in the mental speculator exchange. The Lord is what He is, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and He demands absolute surrender unto Him only. The pure devotee, however, by following the ways of the previous äcäryas, or authorities, can see the Supreme Lord through the transparent medium of a bona fide spiritual master (anupaçyanti). The pure devotee never tries to see the Lord by mental speculation, but he sees Him by following in the footsteps of the äcäryas (mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù [Cc. Madhya 17.186]). Therefore there is no difference of conclusions amongst the Vaiñëava äcäryas regarding the Lord and the devotees. Lord Caitanya asserts that the living entity (jéva) is eternally the servitor of the Lord and that he is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord. This tattva of Lord Caitanya's is shared by all four sampradäyas of the Vaiñëava school (all accepting eternal servitude to the Lord even after salvation), and there is no authorized Vaiñëava äcärya who may think of the Lord and himself as one.
This humbleness of the pure devotee, who is one hundred percent engaged in His service, puts the devotee of the Lord in a trance by which to realize everything, because to the sincere devotee of the Lord, the Lord reveals Himself, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (10.10). The Lord, being the Lord of intelligence in everyone (even in the nondevotee), favors His devotee with proper intelligence so that automatically the pure devotee is enlightened with the factual truth about the Lord and His different energies. The Lord is revealed not by one's speculative power or by one's verbal jugglery over the Absolute Truth. Rather, He reveals Himself to a devotee when He is fully satisfied by the devotee's service attitude. Çukadeva Gosvämé is not a mental speculator or compromiser following the theory of "as many conclusions, as many ways." Rather, he prays to the Lord only, invoking His transcendental pleasure. That is the way of knowing the Lord.

pracoditä—inspired; yena—by whom; purä—in the beginning of creation; sarasvaté—the goddess of learning; vitanvatä—amplified; ajasya—of Brahmä, the first created living being; satém småtim—potent memory; hådi—in the heart; sva—in his own; lakñaëä—aiming at; prädurabhüt—was generated; kila—as if; äsyataù—from the mouth; saù—he; me—unto me; åñéëäm—of the teachers; åñabhaù—the chief; prasédatäm—be pleased.

May the Lord, who in the beginning of the creation amplified the potent knowledge of Brahmä from within his heart and inspired him with full knowledge of creation and of His own Self, and who appeared to be generated from the mouth of Brahmä, be pleased with me.

PURPORT
As we have already discussed hereinbefore, the Lord, as the Supersoul of all living beings from Brahmä to the insignificant ant, endows all with the required knowledge potent in every living being. A living being is sufficiently potent to possess knowledge from the Lord in the proportion of fifty sixty-fourths, or seventy-eight percent, of the full knowledge acquirable. Since the living being is constitutionally part and parcel of the Lord, he is unable to assimilate all the knowledge that the Lord possesses Himself. In the conditioned state, the living being is subject to forget everything after a change of body known as death. This potent knowledge is again inspired by the Lord from within the heart of every living being, and it is known as the awakening of knowledge, for it is comparable to awakening from sleep or unconsciousness. This awakening of knowledge is under the full control of the Lord, and therefore we find in the practical world different grades of knowledge in different persons. This awakening of knowledge is neither an automatic nor a material interaction. The supply source is the Lord Himself (dhiyäà patiù), for even Brahmä is also subject to this regulation of the supreme creator. 
In the beginning of the creation, Brahmä is born first without any father and mother because before Brahmä there were no other living beings. Brahmä is born from the lotus which grows from the abdomen of the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, and therefore he is known as Aja. This Brahmä, or Aja, is also a living being, part and parcel of the Lord, but being the most pious devotee of the Lord, Brahmä is inspired by the Lord to create, subsequent to the main creation by the Lord, through the agency of material nature. Therefore neither the material nature nor Brahmä is independent of the Lord. The material scientists can merely observe the reactions of the material nature without understanding the direction behind such activities, as a child can see the action of electricity without any knowledge of the powerhouse engineer. This imperfect knowledge of the material scientist is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The Vedic knowledge was therefore first impregnated within Brahmä, and it appears that Brahmä distributed the Vedic knowledge. Brahmä is undoubtedly the speaker of the Vedic knowledge, but actually he was inspired by the Lord to receive such transcendental knowledge, as it directly descends from the Lord. The Vedas are therefore called apauruñeya, or not imparted by any created being. Before the creation the Lord was there (näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät), and therefore the words spoken by the Lord are vibrations of transcendental sound. There is a gulf of difference between the two qualities of sound, namely präkåta and apräkåta. The physicist can deal only with the präkåta sound, or sound vibrated in the material sky, and therefore we must know that the Vedic sounds recorded in symbolic expressions cannot be understood by anyone within the universe unless and until one is inspired by the vibration of supernatural (apräkåta) sound, which descends in the chain of disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmä, from Brahmä to Närada, from Närada to Vyäsa and so on. No mundane scholar can translate or reveal the true import of the Vedic mantras (hymns). They cannot be understood unless one is inspired or initiated by the authorized spiritual master. The original spiritual master is the Lord Himself, and the succession comes down through the sources of paramparä, as clearly stated in the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä. So unless one receives the transcendental knowledge from the authorized paramparä, one should be considered useless (niñphalä matäù), even though one may be greatly qualified in the mundane advancements of arts or science.
Çukadeva Gosvämé is praying to the Lord by dint of being inspired from within by the Lord so that he could rightly explain the facts and figures of creation as inquired by Mahäräja Parékñit. A spiritual master is not a theoretical speculator, like the mundane scholar, but is çrotriyaà brahma-niñöham, expert in understanding the Vedic conclusion in disciplic succession and therefore constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. [MU  1.2.12].

May the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who enlivens the materially created bodies of the elements by lying down within the universe, and who in His puruña incarnation causes the living being to be subjected to the sixteen divisions of material modes which are his generator, be pleased to decorate my statements.

PURPORT
As a fully dependent devotee, Çukadeva Gosvämé (unlike a mundane man who is proud of his own capability) invokes the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead so that his statements may be successful and be appreciated by the hearers. The devotee always thinks of himself as instrumental for anything successfully carried out, and he declines to take credit for anything done by himself. The godless atheist wants to take all credit for activities, not knowing that even a blade of grass cannot move without the sanction of the Supreme Spirit, the Personality of Godhead. Çukadeva Gosvämé therefore wants to move by the direction of the Supreme Lord, who inspired Brahmä to speak the Vedic wisdom. The truths described in the Vedic literatures are not theories of mundane imagination, nor are they fictitious, as the less intelligent class of men sometimes think. The Vedic truths are all perfect descriptions of the factual truth without any mistake or illusion, and Çukadeva Gosvämé wants to present the truths of creation not as a metaphysical theory of philosophical speculation, but as the actual facts and figures of the subject, since he would be dictated to by the Lord exactly in the same manner as Brahmäjé was inspired. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), the Lord is Himself the father of the Vedänta knowledge, and it is He only who knows the factual purport of the Vedänta philosophy. So there is no greater truth than the principles of religion mentioned in the Vedas. Such Vedic knowledge or religion is disseminated by authorities like Çukadeva Gosvämé because he is a humble devotional servitor of the Lord who has no desire to become a self-appointed interpreter without authority. That is the way of explaining the Vedic knowledge, technically known as the paramparä system, or descending process.
The intelligent man can see without mistake that any material creation (whether one's own body or a fruit or flower) cannot beautifully grow up without the spiritual touch. The greatest intelligent man of the world or the greatest man of science can present everything very beautifully only insofar as the spirit life is there, or insomuch as the spiritual touch is there. Therefore the source of all truths is the Supreme Spirit, and not gross matter, as wrongly conceived by the gross materialist. We get information from the Vedic literature that the Lord Himself first entered the vacuum of the material universe, and thus all things gradually developed one after another. Similarly, the Lord is situated as localized Paramätmä in every individual being; hence everything is done by Him very beautifully. The sixteen principal creative elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky and the eleven sense organs, first developed from the Lord Himself and were thereby shared by the living entities. Thus the material elements were created for the enjoyment of the living entities. The beautiful arrangement behind all material manifestations is therefore made possible by the energy of the Lord, and the individual living entity can only pray to the Lord to understand it properly. Since the Lord is the supreme entity, different from Çukadeva Gosvämé, the prayer can be offered to Him. The Lord helps the living entity to enjoy the material creation, but the Lord is aloof from such false enjoyment. Çukadeva prays for the mercy of the Lord, not only for being helped personally in presenting the truth, but also for helping others to whom he would like to speak.
TEXT 24
namas tasmai bhagavate
väsudeväya vedhase
papur jïänam ayaà saumyä
yan-mukhämburuhäsavam


namaù—my obeisances; tasmai—unto Him; bhagavate—unto the Personality of Godhead; väsudeväya—unto Väsudeva or His incarnations; vedhase—the compiler of the Vedic literatures; papuù—drunk; jïänam—knowledge; ayam—this Vedic knowledge; saumyäù—the devotees, especially the consorts of Lord Kåñëa; yat—from whose; mukha-amburuha—the lotuslike mouth; äsavam—nectar from His mouth.

I offer my respectful obeisances unto Çréla Vyäsadeva, the incarnation of Väsudeva who compiled the Vedic scriptures. The pure devotees drink up the nectarean transcendental knowledge dropping from the lotuslike mouth of the Lord.

PURPORT
In pursuance of the specific utterance vedhase, or "the compiler of the system of transcendental knowledge," Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has commented that the respectful obeisances are offered to Çréla Vyäsadeva, who is the incarnation of Väsudeva. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has agreed to this, but Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has made a further advance, namely that the nectar from the mouth of Lord Kåñëa is transferred to His different consorts, and thus they learn the finer arts of music, dance, dressing, decorations and all such things which are relished by the Lord. Such music, dance and decorations enjoyed by the Lord are certainly not anything mundane, because the Lord is addressed in the very beginning as para, or transcendental. This transcendental knowledge is unknown to the forgetful conditioned souls. Çréla Vyäsadeva, who is the incarnation of the Lord, thus compiled the Vedic literatures to revive the lost memory of the conditioned souls about their eternal relation with the Lord. One should therefore try to understand the Vedic scriptures, or the nectar transferred by the Lord to His consorts in the conjugal humor, from the lotuslike mouth of Vyäsadeva or Çukadeva. By gradual development of transcendental knowledge, one can rise to the stage of the transcendental arts of music and dance displayed by the Lord in His räsa-lélä. But without having the Vedic knowledge one can hardly understand the transcendental nature of the Lord's räsa dance and music. The pure devotees of the Lord, however, can equally relish the nectar in the form of the profound philosophical discourses and in the form of kissing by the Lord in the räsa dance, as there is no mundane distinction between the two.

Song-1 Prayers by Demigods(SB 3.5.39-51)


TEXT 39
devä ücuù
namäma te deva padäravindaà
prapanna-täpopaçamätapatram
yan-müla-ketä yatayo 'ïjasoru-
saàsära-duùkhaà bahir utkñipanti


deväù ücuù—the demigods said; namäma—we offer our respectful obeisances; te—Your; deva—O Lord; pada-aravindam—lotus feet; prapanna—surrendered; täpa—distress; upaçama—suppresses; ätapatram—umbrella; yat-müla-ketäù—shelter of the lotus feet; yatayaù—great sages; aïjasä—totally; uru—great; saàsära-duùkham—miseries of material existence; bahiù—out; utkñipanti—forcibly throw.

The demigods said: O Lord, Your lotus feet are like an umbrella for the surrendered souls, protecting them from all the miseries of material existence. All the sages under that shelter throw off all material miseries. We therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
There are many sages and saints who engage in trying to conquer rebirth and all other material miseries. But of all of them, those who take shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord can completely throw off all such miseries without difficulty. Others, who are engaged in transcendental activities in different ways, cannot do so. For them it is very difficult. They may artificially think of becoming liberated without accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, but that is not possible. One is sure to fall again to material existence from such false liberation, even though one may have undergone severe penances and austerities. This is the opinion of the demigods, who are not only well versed in Vedic knowledge but are also seers of the past, present and future. The opinions of the demigods are valuable because the demigods are authorized to hold positions in the affairs of universal management. They are appointed by the Lord as His confidential servants.
TEXT 40
dhätar yad asmin bhava éça jéväs
täpa-trayeëäbhihatä na çarma
ätman labhante bhagavaàs taväìghri-
cchäyäà sa-vidyäm ata äçrayema


dhätaù—O father; yat—because; asmin—in this; bhave—material world; éça—O Lord; jéväù—the living entities; täpa—miseries; trayeëa—by the three; abhihatäù—always embarrassed; na—never; çarma—in happiness; ätman—self; labhante—do gain; bhagavan—O Personality of Godhead; tava—Your; aìghri-chäyäm—shade of Your feet; sa-vidyäm—full of knowledge; ataù—obtain; äçrayema—shelter.

O Father, O Lord, O Personality of Godhead, the living entities in the material world can never have any happiness because they are overwhelmed by the three kinds of miseries. Therefore they take shelter of the shade of Your lotus feet, which are full of knowledge, and we also thus take shelter of them.

PURPORT
The way of devotional service is neither sentimental nor mundane. It is the path of reality, by which the living entity can attain the transcendental happiness of being freed from the three kinds of material miseries—miseries arising from the body and mind, from other living entities and from natural disturbances. Everyone who is conditioned by material existence—whether he be a man or beast or demigod or bird—must suffer from ädhyätmika pains (those caused by one's body or mind), ädhibhautika pains (those caused by other living creatures), and ädhidaivika pains (those due to supernatural disturbances). One's happiness is nothing but a hard struggle to get free from the miseries of conditional life. But there is only one way he can be rescued, and that is by accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The argument that unless one has proper knowledge one cannot be freed from material miseries is undoubtedly true. But because the lotus feet of the Lord are full of transcendental knowledge, acceptance of His lotus feet completes that necessity. We have already discussed this point in the First Canto (1.2.7):
väsudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogaù prayojitaù
janayaty äçu vairägyaà
jïänaà ca yad ahaitukam
There is no want of knowledge in the devotional service of Väsudeva, the Personality of Godhead. He, the Lord, personally takes charge of dissipating the darkness of ignorance from the heart of a devotee. He confirms this in the Bhagavad-gétä (10.10):
teñäà satata-yuktänäà
bhajatäà préti-pürvakam
dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà
yena mäm upayänti te
Empiric philosophical speculation cannot give one relief from the threefold miseries of material existence. Simply to endeavor for knowledge without devoting oneself to the Lord is a waste of valuable time.
TEXT 41
märganti yat te mukha-padma-néòaiç
chandaù-suparëair åñayo vivikte
yasyägha-marñoda-sarid-varäyäù
padaà padaà tértha-padaù prapannäù


märganti—searching after; yat—as; te—Your; mukha-padma—lotuslike face; néòaiù—by those who have taken shelter of such a lotus flower; chandaù—Vedic hymns; suparëaiù—by the wings; åñayaù—the sages; vivikte—with a clear mind; yasya—whose; agha-marña-uda—that which offers freedom from all reactions to sin; sarit—rivers; varäyäù—in the best; padam padam—in every step; tértha-padaù—one whose lotus feet are as good as a place of pilgrimage; prapannäù—taking shelter.

The lotus feet of the Lord are by themselves the shelter of all places of pilgrimage. The great clear-minded sages, carried by the wings of the Vedas, always search after the nest of Your lotuslike face. Some of them surrender to Your lotus feet at every step by taking shelter of the best of rivers [the Ganges], which can deliver one from all sinful reactions.

PURPORT
The paramahaàsas are compared to royal swans who make their nests on the petals of the lotus flower. The Lord's transcendental bodily parts are always compared to the lotus flower because in the material world the lotus flower is the last word in beauty. The most beautiful thing in the world is the Vedas, or the Bhagavad-gétä, because therein knowledge is imparted by the Personality of Godhead Himself. The paramahaàsa makes his nest in the lotuslike face of the Lord and always seeks shelter at His lotus feet, which are reached by the wings of Vedic wisdom. Since the Lord is the original source of all emanations, intelligent persons, enlightened by Vedic knowledge, seek the shelter of the Lord, just as birds who leave the nest search out the nest again to take complete rest. All Vedic knowledge is meant for understanding the Supreme Lord, as stated by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15): vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù. Intelligent persons, who are like swans, take shelter of the Lord by all means and do not hover on the mental plane by fruitlessly speculating on different philosophies.
The Lord is so kind that He has spread the river Ganges throughout the universe so that by taking bath in that holy river everyone can get release from the reactions of sins, which occur at every step. There are many rivers in the world which are able to evoke one's sense of God consciousness simply by one's bathing in them, and the river Ganges is chief amongst them. In India there are five sacred rivers—the Ganges, Yamunä, Godävaré, Narmadä and Käveré—but the Ganges is the most sacred. The river Ganges and the Bhagavad-gétä are chief sources of transcendental happiness for mankind, and intelligent persons must take shelter of them to go back home, back to Godhead. Even Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya recommends that a little knowledge of the Bhagavad-gétä and the drinking of a little quantity of Ganges water can save one from the punishment of Yamaräja.
TEXT 42

yat—that which; çraddhayä—by eagerness; çrutavatyä—simply by hearing; ca—also; bhaktyä—in devotion; sammåjyamäne—being cleansed; hådaye—in the heart; avadhäya—meditation; jïänena—by knowledge; vairägya—of detachment; balena—by the strength; dhéräù—the pacified; vrajema—must go to; tat—that; te—Your; aìghri—feet; saroja-péöham—lotus sanctuary.

Simply by hearing about Your lotus feet with eagerness and devotion and by meditating upon them within the heart, one at once becomes enlightened with knowledge, and on the strength of detachment one becomes pacified. We must therefore take shelter of the sanctuary of Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
The miracles of meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord with eagerness and devotion are so great that no other process can compare to it. The minds of materialistic persons are so disturbed that it is almost impossible for them to search after the Supreme Truth by personal regulative endeavors. But even such materialistic men, with a little eagerness for hearing about the Lord's transcendental name, fame, qualities, etc., can surpass all other methods of attaining knowledge and detachment. The conditioned soul is attached to the bodily conception of the self, and therefore he is in ignorance. The culture of self-knowledge can bring about detachment from material affection, and without such detachment there is no meaning to knowledge. The most stubborn attachment for material enjoyment is sex life. One who is attached to sex life is to be understood as devoid of knowledge. Knowledge must be followed by detachment. That is the way of self-realization. These two essentials for self-realization—knowledge and detachment—become manifest very quickly if one performs devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The word dhéra is very significant in this connection. A person who is not disturbed even in the presence of causes of disturbance is called dhéra. Çré Yämunäcärya says, "Since my heart has been overwhelmed by the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa, I cannot even think of sex life, and if thoughts of sex come upon me I at once feel disgust." A devotee of the Lord becomes an elevated dhéra by the simple process of meditating in eagerness on the lotus feet of the Lord.
Devotional service entails being initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and following his instruction in regard to hearing about the Lord. Such a bona fide spiritual master is accepted by regularly hearing from him about the Lord. The improvement in knowledge and detachment can be perceived by devotees as an actual experience. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu strongly recommended this process of hearing from a bona fide devotee, and by following this process one can achieve the highest result, conquering all other methods.
TEXT 43
viçvasya janma-sthiti-saàyamärthe
kåtävatärasya padämbujaà te
vrajema sarve çaraëaà yad éça
småtaà prayacchaty abhayaà sva-puàsäm


viçvasya—of the cosmic universe; janma—creation; sthiti—maintenance; saàyama-arthe—for the dissolution also; kåta—accepted or assumed; avatärasya—of the incarnations; pada-ambujam—lotus feet; te—of Your; vrajema—let us take shelter; sarve—all of us; çaraëam—shelter; yat—that which; éça—O Lord; småtam—remembrance; prayacchati—awarding; abhayam—courage; sva-puàsäm—of the devotees.

O Lord, You assume incarnations for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation, and therefore we all take shelter of Your lotus feet because they always award remembrance and courage to Your devotees.

PURPORT
For the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestations there are three incarnations: Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Lord Çiva). They are the controllers or masters of the three modes of material nature, which cause the phenomenal manifestation. Viñëu is the master of the mode of goodness, Brahmä is the master of the mode of passion, and Maheçvara is the master of the mode of ignorance. There are different kinds of devotees according to the modes of nature. Persons in the mode of goodness worship Lord Viñëu, those in the mode of passion worship Lord Brahmä, and those in the mode of ignorance worship Lord Çiva. All three of these deities are incarnations of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa because He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Here the demigods directly refer to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and not to those of His different incarnations. The incarnation of Viñëu in the material world is, however, directly worshiped by the demigods. It is learned from various scriptures that the demigods approach Lord Viñëu in the ocean of milk and submit their grievances whenever there is some difficulty in the administration of universal affairs. Although Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva are incarnations of the Lord, they worship Lord Viñëu, and thus they are also counted amongst the demigods and not as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons who worship Lord Viñëu are called demigods, and persons who do not do so are called asuras, or demons. Viñëu always takes the side of the demigods, but Brahmä and Çiva sometimes take the side of the demons; it is not that they become one in interest with them, but sometimes they do something in order to gain control over the demons.
TEXT 44
yat sänubandhe 'sati deha-gehe

yat—because; sa-anubandhe—due to becoming entangled; asati—thus being; deha—the gross material body; gehe—in the home; mama—mine; aham—I; iti—thus; üòha—great, deep; durägrahäëäm—undesirable eagerness; puàsäm—of persons; su-düram—far away; vasataù—dwelling; api—although; puryäm—within the body; bhajema—let us worship; tat—therefore; te—Your; bhagavan—O Lord; pada-abjam—lotus feet.

O Lord, persons who are entangled by undesirable eagerness for the temporary body and kinsmen, and who are bound by thoughts of "mine" and "I," are unable to see Your lotus feet, although Your lotus feet are situated within their own bodies. But let us take shelter of Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
The whole Vedic philosophy of life is that one should get rid of the material encagement of gross and subtle bodies, which only cause one to continue in a condemned life of miseries. This material body continues as long as one is not detached from the false conception of lording it over material nature. The impetus for lording it over material nature is the sense of "mine" and "I." "I am the lord of all that I survey. So many things I possess, and I shall possess more and more. Who can be richer than I in wealth and education? I am the master, and I am God. Who else is there but me?" All these ideas reflect the philosophy of ahaà mama, the conception that "I am everything." Persons conducted by such a conception of life can never get liberation from material bondage. But even a person perpetually condemned to the miseries of material existence can get relief from bondage if he simply agrees to hear only kåñëa-kathä. In this Age of Kali, the process of hearing kåñëa-kathä is the most effective means of gaining release from unwanted family affection and thus finding permanent freedom in life. The Age of Kali is full of sinful reactions, and people are more and more addicted to the qualities of this age, but simply by hearing and chanting of kåñëa-kathä one is sure to go back to Godhead. Therefore, people should be trained to hear only kåñëa-kathä—by all means—in order to get relief from all miseries.
TEXT 45
tän vai hy asad-våttibhir akñibhir ye
parähåtäntar-manasaù pareça
atho na paçyanty urugäya nünaà
ye te padanyäsa-viläsa-lakñyäù


tän—the lotus feet of the Lord; vai—certainly; hi—for; asat—materialistic; våttibhiù—by those who are influenced by the external energy; akñibhiù—by the senses; ye—those; parähåta—missing at a distance; antaù-manasaù—of the internal mind; pareça—O Supreme; atho—therefore; na—never; paçyanti—can see; urugäya—O great; nünam—but; ye—those who; te—Your; padanyäsa—activities; viläsa—transcendental enjoyment; lakñyäù—those who see.

O great Supreme Lord, offensive persons whose internal vision has been too affected by external materialistic activities cannot see Your lotus feet, but those feet are seen by Your pure devotees, whose one and only aim is to transcendentally enjoy Your activities.

PURPORT
As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.61), the Lord is situated in everyone's heart. It is natural that one should he able to see the Lord at least within himself. But that is not possible for those whose internal vision has been covered by external activities. The pure soul, which is symptomized by consciousness, can be easily perceived even by a common man because consciousness is spread all over the body. The yoga system as recommended in the Bhagavad-gétä is to concentrate the mental activities internally and thus see the lotus feet of the Lord within oneself. But there are many so-called yogés who have no concern with the Lord but are only concerned with consciousness, which they accept as the final realization. Such realization of consciousness is taught by the Bhagavad-gétä within only a few minutes, whereas the so-called yogés take continuous years to realize it because of their offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord. The greatest offense is to deny the existence of the Lord as separate from the individual souls or to accept the Lord and the individual soul as one and the same. The impersonalists misinterpret the theory of reflection, and thus they wrongly accept the individual consciousness as the supreme consciousness.
The theory of the reflection of the Supreme can be clearly understood without difficulty by any sincere common man. When there is a reflection of the sky on the water, both the sky and the stars are seen within the water, but it is understood that the sky and the stars are not to be accepted on the same level. The stars are parts of the sky, and therefore they cannot be equal to the whole. The sky is the whole, and the stars are parts. They cannot be one and the same. Transcendentalists who do not accept the supreme consciousness as separate from the individual consciousness are as offensive as the materialists who deny even the existence of the Lord.
Such offenders cannot actually see the lotus feet of the Lord within themselves, nor are they even able to see the devotees of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are so kind that they roam to all places to enlighten people in God consciousness. The offenders, however, lose the chance to receive the Lord's devotees, although the offenseless common man is at once influenced by the devotees' presence. In this connection there is an interesting story of a hunter and Devarñi Närada. A hunter in the forest, although a great sinner, was not an intentional offender. He was at once influenced by the presence of Närada, and he agreed to take to the path of devotion, leaving aside his hearth and home. But the offenders Nalaküvara and Maëigréva, even though living amongst the demigods, had to undergo the punishment of becoming trees in their next lives, although by the grace of a devotee they were later delivered by the Lord. Offenders have to wait until they receive the mercy of devotees, and then they can become eligible to see the lotus feet of the Lord within themselves. But due to their offenses and their extreme materialism, they cannot see even the devotees of the Lord. Engaged in external activities, they kill the internal vision. The Lord's devotees, however, do not mind the offenses of the foolish in their many gross and subtle bodily endeavors. The Lord's devotees continue to bestow the blessings of devotion upon all such offenders without hesitation. That is the nature of devotees.
TEXT 46
pänena te deva kathä-sudhäyäù
pravåddha-bhaktyä viçadäçayä ye
vairägya-säraà pratilabhya bodhaà
yathäïjasänvéyur akuëöha-dhiñëyam


pänena—by drinking; te—of You; deva—O Lord; kathä—topics; sudhäyäù—of the nectar; pravåddha—highly enlightened; bhaktyä—by devotional service; viçada-äçayäù—with a greatly serious attitude; ye—those who; vairägya-säram—the entire purport of renunciation; pratilabhya—achieving; bodham—intelligence; yathä—as much as; aïjasä—quickly; anvéyuù—achieve; akuëöha-dhiñëyam—Vaikuëöhaloka in the spiritual sky.

O Lord, persons who, because of their serious attitude, attain the stage of enlightened devotional service achieve the complete meaning of renunciation and knowledge and attain the Vaikuëöhaloka in the spiritual sky simply by drinking the nectar of Your topics.

PURPORT
The difference between the impersonalistic mental speculators and the pure devotees of the Lord is that the former pass through a miserable understanding of the Absolute Truth at every stage, whereas the devotees enter into the kingdom of all pleasures even from the beginning of their attempt. The devotee has only to hear about devotional activities, which are as simple as anything in ordinary life, and he also acts very simply, whereas the mental speculator has to pass through a jugglery of words, which are partially facts and partially a make-show for the maintenance of an artificial impersonal status. In spite of his strenuous efforts to attain perfect knowledge, the impersonalist attains merging into the impersonal oneness of the brahma-jyoti of the Lord, which is also attained by the enemies of the Lord simply because of their being killed by Him. The devotees, however, attain to the highest stage of knowledge and renunciation and achieve the Vaikuëöhalokas, the planets in the spiritual sky. The impersonalist attains only the sky, and does not achieve any tangible transcendental bliss, whereas the devotee attains to the planets where real spiritual life prevails. With a serious attitude, the devotee throws away all other achievements like so much dust, and he accepts only devotional service, the transcendental culmination.
TEXT 47
tathäpare cätma-samädhi-yoga-

tathä—as far as; apare—others; ca—also; ätma-samädhi—transcendental self-realization; yoga—means; balena—by the strength of; jitvä—conquering; prakåtim—acquired nature or the modes of nature; baliñöhäm—very powerful; tväm—You; eva—only; dhéräù—pacified; puruñam—person; viçanti—enters into; teñäm—for them; çramaù—much labor; syät—has to be taken; na—never; tu—but; sevayä—by serving; te—of You.

Others, who are pacified by means of transcendental self-realization and have conquered over the modes of nature by dint of strong power and knowledge, also enter into You, but for them there is much pain, whereas the devotee simply discharges devotional service and thus feels no such pain.

PURPORT
In terms of a labor of love and its returns, the bhaktas, or devotees of the Lord, always have priority over persons who are addicted to the association of jïänés, or impersonalists, and yogés, or mystics. The word apare (others) is very significant in this connection. "Others" refers to the jïänés and the yogés, whose only hope is to merge into the existence of the impersonal brahma-jyoti. Although their destination is not so important in comparison to the destination of the devotees, the labor of the nondevotees is far greater than that of the bhaktas. One may suggest that there is sufficient labor for the devotees also in the matter of discharging devotional service. But that labor is compensated by the enhancement of transcendental pleasure. The devotees derive more transcendental pleasure while engaged continuously in the service of the Lord than when they have no such engagement. In the family combination of a man and a woman there is much labor and responsibility for both of them, yet when they are single they feel more trouble for want of their united activities.
The union of the impersonalists and the union of the devotees are not on a par. The impersonalists try to fully stop their individuality by attaining säyujya-mukti, or unification by merging into oneness, whereas the devotees keep their individuality to exchange feelings in relationship with the supreme individual Lord. Such reciprocation of feelings takes place in the transcendental Vaikuëöha planets, and therefore the liberation sought by the impersonalists is already achieved in devotional service. The devotees attain mukti automatically, while continuing the transcendental pleasure of maintaining individuality. As explained in the previous verse, the destination of the devotees is Vaikuëöha, or akuëöha-dhiñëya, the place where anxieties are completely eradicated. One should not mistake the destination of the devotees and that of the impersonalists to be one and the same. The destinations are distinctly different, and the transcendental pleasure derived by the devotee is also distinct from cin-mätra, or spiritual feelings alone.

tat—therefore; te—Your; vayam—all of us; loka—world; sisåkñayä—for the sake of creation; ädya—O original person; tvayä—by You; anusåñöäù—being created one after another; tribhiù—by the three modes of nature; ätmabhiù—by one's own; sma—in the past; sarve—all; viyuktäù—separated; sva-vihära-tantram—the network of activities for one's own pleasure; na—not; çaknumaù—could do it; tat—that; pratihartave—to award; te—unto You.

O original person, we are therefore but Yours only. Although we are Your creatures, we are born one after another under the influence of the three modes of nature, and for this reason we are separated in action. Therefore, after the creation we could not act concertedly for Your transcendental pleasure.

PURPORT
The cosmic creation is working under the influence of the three modes of the external potency of the Lord. Different creatures are also under the same influence, and therefore they cannot act concertedly in satisfying the Lord. Because of this diverse activity, there cannot be any harmony in the material world. The best policy, therefore, is to act for the sake of the Lord. That will bring about the desired harmony.
TEXT 49

O unborn one, please enlighten us regarding the ways and means by which we can offer You all enjoyable grains and commodities, so that both we and all other living entities in this world can maintain ourselves without disturbance and can easily accumulate the necessities of life, both for You and for ourselves.

PURPORT
Developed consciousness begins from the human form of life and further increases in the forms of the demigods living on higher planets. The earth is situated almost in the middle of the universe, and thus the human form of life is situated between the life of the demigods and that of the demons. The planetary systems above the earth are especially meant for the higher intellectuals, called demigods. They are called demigods because although their standard of life is far advanced in culture, enjoyment, luxury, beauty, education and duration of life, they are always fully God conscious. Such demigods are always ready to render service to the Supreme Lord because they are perfectly aware of the fact that every living entity is constitutionally an eternal subordinate servitor of the Lord. They also know that it is the Lord only who can maintain all living entities with all the necessities of life. The Vedic hymns confirm this truth: eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän, tä enam abruvann äyatanaà naù prajänéhi yasmin pratiñöhitä annam adäme, etc. Also, in the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord is mentioned as bhüta-bhåt, or the maintainer of all living creatures.
The modern theory that starvation is due to an increase in population is not accepted by the demigods, or the devotees of the Lord. The devotees, or demigods, are fully aware that the Lord can maintain any number of living entities, provided they are conscious of how to eat. If they want to eat like ordinary animals, who have no God consciousness, then they must live in starvation, poverty and want, like the jungle animals in the forest. The jungle animals are also maintained by the Lord with their respective foodstuffs, but they are not advanced in God consciousness. Similarly, human beings are provided with food grains, vegetables, fruits and milk by the grace of the Lord, but it is the duty of human beings to acknowledge the mercy of the Lord. As a matter of gratitude, they should feel obliged to the Lord for their supply of foodstuff, and they must first offer Him food in sacrifice and then partake of the remnants.
In the Bhagavad-gétä (3.13) it is confirmed that one who takes foodstuff after a performance of sacrifice eats real food for proper maintenance of the body and soul, but that one who cooks for himself and does not perform any sacrifice eats only lumps of sin in the shape of foodstuffs. Such sinful eating can never make one happy or free from scarcity. Famine is not due to an increase in population, as less intelligent economists think, but is due to the ingratitude of human beings. When human society is grateful to the Lord for all His gifts for the maintenance of the living entities, there is certainly no scarcity or want in society. But when people are unaware of the intrinsic value of such gifts from the Lord, surely they will be in want. A person who has no God consciousness may live in opulence for the time being due to his past virtuous acts, but if he forgets his relationship with the Lord, certainly he must await the stage of starvation by the law of the powerful material nature. One cannot escape the vigilance of the powerful material nature unless he leads a God conscious or devotional life.
TEXT 50

küöa-stha ädyaù puruñaù puräëaù
tvaà deva çaktyäà guëa-karma-yonau
retas tv ajäyäà kavim ädadhe 'jaù


tvam—Your Lordship; naù—of us; suräëäm—of the demigods; asi—You are; sa-anvayänäm—with different gradations; küöa-sthaù—one who is unchanged; ädyaù—without any superior; puruñaù—the founder person; puräëaù—the oldest, who has no other founder; tvam—You; deva—O Lord; çaktyäm—unto the energy; guëa-karma-yonau—unto the cause of the material modes and activities; retaù—semen of birth; tu—indeed; ajäyäm—for begetting; kavim—the total living entities; ädadhe—initiated; ajaù—one who is unborn.

You are the original personal founder of all the demigods and the orders of different gradations, yet You are the oldest and are unchanged. O Lord, You have no source or superior. You have impregnated the external energy with the semen of the total living entities, yet You are unborn.

PURPORT
The Lord, the original person, is the father of all other living entities, beginning from Brahmä, the personality from whom all other living entities in different gradations of species are generated. Yet the supreme father has no other father. Every one of the living entities of all grades, up to Brahmä, the original creature of the universe, is begotten by a father, but He, the Lord, has no father. When He descends to the material plane, out of His causeless mercy He accepts one of His great devotees as His father to keep pace with the rules of the material world. But since He is the Lord, He is always independent in choosing who will become His father. For example, the Lord came out of a pillar in His incarnation as Nåsiàhadeva, and by the Lord's causeless mercy Ahalyä came out of a stone by the touch of the lotus feet of His incarnation as Lord Çré Räma. As the Supersoul, He is also the companion of every living entity, but He remains unchanged. The living entity changes his body in the material world, but even when the Lord is in the material world, He is ever unchanged. That is His prerogative.
As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (14.3), the Lord impregnates the external or material energy, and thus the total living entities later come out in different gradations, beginning from Brahmä, the first demigod, down to the insignificant ant. All gradations of living entities are manifested by Brahmä and the external energy, but the Lord is the original father of everyone. Therefore the relationship of every living being with the Supreme Lord is certainly one of son and father and not one of equality. Sometimes out of love the son will become more than the father, but the basic relationship of father and son is one of superior and subordinate. Every living entity, however great he may be, even up to demigods like Brahmä and Indra, is an eternally subordinate servitor of the supreme father. The mahat-tattva principle is the generating source of all the modes of material nature, and the living entities take birth in the material world in bodies supplied by the mother, material nature, in terms of their previous work. The body is a gift of material nature, but the soul is originally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.

tataù—therefore; vayam—all of us; mat-pramukhäù—coming from the total cosmos, the mahat-tattva; yat-arthe—for the purpose of which; babhüvima—created; ätman—O Supreme Self; karaväma—shall do; kim—what; te—Your service; tvam—Yourself; naù—to us; sva-cakñuù—personal plan; paridehi—specifically grant us; çaktyä—with potency to work; deva—O Lord; kriyä-arthe—for acting; yat—from which; anugrahäëäm—of those who are specifically favored.

O Supreme Self, please give us, who are created in the beginning from the mahat-tattva, the total cosmic energy, Your kind directions on how we shall act. Kindly award us Your perfect knowledge and potency so that we can render You service in the different departments of subsequent creation.

PURPORT
The Lord creates this material world and impregnates the material energy with the living entities who will act in the material world. All these actions have a divine plan behind them. The plan is to give the conditioned souls who desire to enjoy sense gratification a chance to do so. But there is another plan behind the creation: to help the living entities realize that they are created for the transcendental sense gratification of the Lord and not for their individual sense gratification. This is the constitutional position of the living entities. The Lord is one without a second, and He expands Himself into many for His transcendental pleasure. All the expansions—the viñëu-tattvas, the jéva-tattvas and the çakti-tattvas (the Personalities of Godhead, the living entities and the different potent energies)—are different offshoots from the same one Supreme Lord. The jéva-tattvas are separated expansions of the viñëu-tattvas, and although there are differences in potency between the jéva-tattvas and the viñëu-tattvas, they are all meant for the transcendental sense gratification of the Supreme Lord. Some of the jévas, however, wanted to lord it over material nature in imitation of the lordship of the Personality of Godhead. Regarding when and why such propensities overcame the pure living entities, it can only be explained that the jéva-tattvas have infinitesimal independence and that due to misuse of this independence some of the living entities have become implicated in the conditions of cosmic creation and are therefore called nitya-baddhas, or eternally conditioned souls.
The expansions of Vedic wisdom give the nitya-baddhas, the conditioned living entities, a chance to improve, and those who take advantage of such transcendental knowledge gradually regain their lost consciousness of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord. The demigods are amongst the conditioned souls who have developed this pure consciousness of service to the Lord but who at the same time continue to desire to lord it over the material energy. Such mixed consciousness puts a conditioned soul in the position of managing the affairs of this creation. The demigods are entrusted leaders of the conditioned souls. As some of the old prisoners in government jails are entrusted with some responsible work of prison management, so the demigods are improved conditioned souls acting as representatives of the Lord in the material creation. Such demigods are devotees of the Lord in the material world, and when completely free from all material desire to lord it over the material energy, they become pure devotees and have no desire but to serve the Lord. Therefore any living entity who desires a position in the material world may desire so in the service of the Lord and may seek power and intelligence from the Lord, as exemplified by the demigods in this particular verse. One cannot do anything unless he is enlightened and empowered by the Lord. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca. All recollections, knowledge, etc., as well as all forgetfulness, are engineered by the Lord, who is sitting within the heart of everyone. The intelligent man seeks the help of the Lord, and the Lord helps the sincere devotees engaged in His multifarious services.
The demigods are entrusted by the Lord with creating different species of living entities according to their past deeds. They are herein asking the favor of the Lord for the intelligence and power to carry out their task. Similarly, any conditioned soul may also engage in the service of the Lord under the guidance of an expert spiritual master and thus gradually become freed from the entanglement of material existence. The spiritual master is the manifested representative of the Lord, and anyone who puts himself under the guidance of a spiritual master and acts accordingly is said to be acting in terms of buddhi-yoga, as explained in the Bhagavad-gétä (2.41):
vyavasäyätmikä buddhir
ekeha kuru-nandana
bahu-çäkhä hy anantäç ca
buddhayo 'vyavasäyinäm
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Fifth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Vidura's Talks with Maitreya."

TEXT 1
brahmoväca
jïäto 'si me 'dya sucirän nanu deha-bhäjäà
na jïäyate bhagavato gatir ity avadyam
nänyat tvad asti bhagavann api tan na çuddhaà
mäyä-guëa-vyatikaräd yad urur vibhäsi


brahmä uväca—Lord Brahmä said; jïätaù—known; asi—You are; me—by me; adya—today; sucirät—after a long time; nanu—but; deha-bhäjäm—of one who has a material body; na—not; jïäyate—is known; bhagavataù—of the Personality of Godhead; gatiù—course; iti—so it is; avadyam—great offense; na anyat—none beyond; tvat—You; asti—there is; bhagavan—O my Lord; api—even though there is; tat—anything that may be; na—never; çuddham—absolute; mäyä—of the material energy; guëa-vyatikarät—because of the mixture of the modes of; yat—to which; uruù—transcendental; vibhäsi—You are.

Lord Brahmä said: O my Lord, today, after many, many years of penance, I have come to know about You. Oh, how unfortunate the embodied living entities are that they are unable to know Your personality! My Lord, You are the only knowable object because there is nothing supreme beyond You. If there is anything supposedly superior to You, it is not the Absolute. You exist as the Supreme by exhibiting the creative energy of matter.

PURPORT
The highest peak of the ignorance of the living entities who are conditioned by material bodies is that they are unaware of the supreme cause of the cosmic manifestation. Different people have different theories regarding the supreme cause, but none of them are genuine. The only supreme cause is Lord Viñëu, and the intervening impediment to understanding Him as such is His illusory energy. The Lord has employed His wonderful material energy in manifesting many, many wonderful distractions in the material world, and the conditioned souls, illusioned by the same energy, are thus unable to know the supreme cause. The most stalwart scientists and philosophers, therefore, cannot be accepted as wonderful. They only appear wonderful because they are instruments in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord. Under illusion, the general mass of people deny the existence of the Supreme Lord and accept the foolish products of the illusory energy as supreme.
One can know the supreme cause, the Personality of Godhead, by the causeless mercy of the Lord, which is bestowed upon the Lord's pure devotees like Brahmä and those in his disciplic succession. By acts of penance only was Lord Brahmä able to see the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, and by realization only could he understand the Lord as He is. Brahmä was extremely satisfied upon observing the magnificent beauty and opulence of the Lord, and he admitted that nothing can be comparable to Him. Only by penance can one appreciate the beauty and opulence of the Lord, and when one is acquainted with that beauty and opulence, one is no longer attracted by any other. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (2.59): paraà dåñövä nivartate.
Foolish human beings who do not endeavor to investigate the supreme beauty and opulence of the Lord are here condemned by Brahmä. It is imperative that every human being try for such knowledge, and if anyone does not do so, his life is spoiled. Anything that is beautiful and opulent in the material sense is enjoyed by those living entities who are like crows. Crows always engage in picking at rejected garbage, whereas the white ducks do not mix with the crows. Rather, they take pleasure in transparent lakes with lotus flowers, surrounded by beautiful orchards. Both crows and ducks are undoubtedly birds by birth, but they are not of the same feather.

çaçvan-nivåtta-tamasaù sad-anugrahäya
ädau gåhétam avatära-çataika-béjaà
yan-näbhi-padma-bhavanäd aham äviräsam


rüpam—form; yat—which; etat—that; avabodha-rasa—of Your internal potency; udayena—with the manifestation; çaçvat—forever; nivåtta—freed from; tamasaù—material contamination; sat-anugrahäya—for the sake of the devotees; ädau—original in the creative energy of matter; gåhétam—accepted; avatära—of incarnations; çata-eka-béjam—the root cause of hundreds; yat—that which; näbhi-padma—the navel lotus flower; bhavanät—from the home; aham—myself; äviräsam—generated.

The form which I see is eternally freed from material contamination and has advented to show mercy to the devotees as a manifestation of internal potency. This incarnation is the origin of many other incarnations, and I am born from the lotus flower grown from Your navel home.

PURPORT
The three deities Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Çiva), the executive heads of the three modes of material nature (passion, goodness and ignorance), are all generated from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is described herein by Brahmä. From the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, many Viñëu incarnations expand at different ages in the duration of the cosmic manifestation. They are expanded only for the transcendental happiness of the pure devotees. The incarnations of Viñëu, who appear at different ages and times, are never to be compared to the conditioned souls. The viñëu-tattvas are not to be compared to deities like Brahmä and Çiva, nor are they on the same level. Anyone who compares them is called a päñaëòé, or infidel. Tamasaù, mentioned herein, is the material nature, and the spiritual nature has a completely separate existence from tamaù. Therefore, the spiritual nature is called avabodha-rasa or avarodha-rasa. Avarodha means "that which completely nullifies." In the Transcendence there is no chance of material contact by any means. Brahmä is the first living being, and therefore he mentions his birth from the lotus flower generated from the abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu.

na—do not; ataù param—hereafter; parama—O Supreme; yat—that which; bhavataù—of Your Lordship; svarüpam—eternal form; änanda-mätram—impersonal Brahman effulgence; avikalpam—without changes; aviddha-varcaù—without deterioration of potency; paçyämi—do I see; viçva-såjam—creator of the cosmic manifestation; ekam—one without a second; aviçvam—and yet not of matter; ätman—O Supreme Cause; bhüta—body; indriya—senses; ätmaka—on such identification; madaù—pride; te—unto You; upäçritaù—surrendered; asmi—I am.

O my Lord, I do not see a form superior to Your present form of eternal bliss and knowledge. In Your impersonal Brahman effulgence in the spiritual sky, there is no occasional change and no deterioration of internal potency. I surrender unto You because whereas I am proud of my material body and senses, Your Lordship is the cause of the cosmic manifestation and yet You are untouched by matter.

PURPORT
As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.55), bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù: the Supreme Personality of Godhead can only be partially known, and only by the process of devotional service to the Lord. Lord Brahmä became aware that the Supreme Lord Kåñëa has many, many eternal, blissful forms of knowledge. He has described such expansions of the Supreme Lord, Govinda, in his Brahma-saàhitä (5.33), as follows:
advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam
ädyaà puräëa-puruñaà nava-yauvanaà ca
vedeñu durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is nondual and infallible. He is the original cause, the cause of all causes, who expands in many, many forms. Although He is the oldest personality, He is ever youthful, unaffected by old age. That Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be known by the academic wisdom of the Vedas; one has to approach the pure devotee of the Lord to understand Him."
The only way to understand the Lord as He is, is by devotional service to the Lord, or by approaching the devotee of the Lord who always has the Lord in his heart. By devotional perfection one can understand that the impersonal brahma-jyoti is only a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, and that the three puruña expansions in the material creation are His plenary portions. In the spiritual sky of the brahma-jyoti there is no change of various kalpas or millenniums, and there are no creative activities in the Vaikuëöha worlds. The influence of time is conspicuous by its absence. The rays of the transcendental body of the Lord, the unlimited brahma-jyoti, are undeterred by the influence of the material energy. In the material world also, the initial creator is the Lord Himself. He brings about the creation of Brahmä, who becomes the subsequent creator, empowered by the Lord.

tat—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa; vä—or; idam—this present form; bhuvana-maìgala—O You who are all-auspicious for all the universes; maìgaläya—for the sake of all prosperity; dhyäne—in meditation; sma—as it were; naù—unto us; darçitam—manifested; te—Your; upäsakänäm—of the devotees; tasmai—unto Him; namaù—my respectful obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Personality of Godhead; anuvidhema—I perform; tubhyam—unto You; yaù—which; anädåtaù—is neglected; naraka-bhägbhiù—by persons destined for hell; asat-prasaìgaiù—by material topics.

This present form, or any transcendental form expanded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, is equally auspicious for all the universes. Since You have manifested this eternal personal form upon whom Your devotees meditate, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Those who are destined to be dispatched to the path of hell neglect Your personal form because of speculating on material topics.

PURPORT
Regarding the personal and impersonal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth, the personal forms exhibited by the Lord in His different plenary expansions are all for the benediction of all the universes. The personal form of the Lord is also worshiped in meditation as the Supersoul, Paramätmä, but the impersonal brahma-jyoti is not worshiped. Persons who are addicted to the impersonal feature of the Lord, whether in meditation or otherwise, are all pilgrims to hell because, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (12.5), impersonalists simply waste their time in mundane mental speculation, being addicted more to false arguments than to reality. Therefore, the association of the impersonalists is condemned herewith by Brahmä.
All the plenary expansions of the Personality of Godhead are equally potent, as confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.46):
dépärcir eva hi daçäntaram abhyupetya
dépäyate vivåta-hetu-samäna-dharmä
yas tädåg eva hi ca viñëutayä vibhäti
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
The Lord expands Himself as the flames of a fire expand one after another. Although Çré Kåñëa, Govinda, is accepted as the original flame, the Supreme Person, all of His  expansions, such as Räma, Nåsiàha and Varäha, are as potent as the original Lord. All such expanded forms are transcendental. In the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is made clear that the Supreme Truth is eternally uncontaminated by material touch. There is no jugglery of words or activities in the transcendental kingdom of the Lord. All the Lord's forms are transcendental, and such manifestations are ever identical. The particular form of the Lord exhibited to a devotee is not mundane, even though the devotee may be full of material desires, nor is it manifested under the influence of the material energy, as is foolishly considered by the impersonalists. Impersonalists who consider the transcendental forms of the Lord to be products of the material world are surely destined for hell.

ye—those who; tu—but; tvadéya—Your; caraëa-ambuja—lotus feet; koça—inside; gandham—aroma; jighranti—smell; karëa-vivaraiù—through the channel of the ears; çruti-väta-nétam—carried by the air of Vedic sound; bhaktyä—by devotional service; gåhéta-caraëaù—accepting the lotus feet; parayä—transcendental; ca—also; teñäm—for them; na—never; apaiñi—separate; nätha—O my Lord; hådaya—of the heart; ambu-ruhät—from the lotus; sva-puàsäm—of Your own devotees.

O my Lord, persons who smell the aroma of Your lotus feet, carried by the air of Vedic sound through the holes of the ears, accept Your devotional service. For them You are never separated from the lotus of their hearts.

PURPORT
For the pure devotee of the Lord there is nothing beyond the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord knows that such devotees do not wish anything more than that. The word tu specifically establishes this fact. The Lord also does not wish to be separated from the lotus hearts of those pure devotees. That is the transcendental relationship between the pure devotees and the Personality of Godhead. Because the Lord does not wish to separate Himself from the hearts of such pure devotees, it is understood that they are specifically dearer to Him than the impersonalists. The relationship of the pure devotees with the Lord develops because of devotional service to the Lord on the authentic basis of Vedic authority. Such pure devotees are not mundane sentimentalists but are factually realists because their activities are supported by the Vedic authorities who have given aural reception to the facts mentioned in the Vedic literatures.
The word parayä is very significant. Parä bhakti, or spontaneous love of God, is the basis of an intimate relationship with the Lord. This highest stage of relationship with the Lord can be attained simply by hearing about Him (His name, form, qualities, etc.) from authentic sources like the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, recited by pure, unalloyed devotees of the Lord.

tävat—until then; bhayam—fear; draviëa—wealth; deha—body; suhåt—relatives; nimittam—for the matter of; çokaù—lamentation; spåhä—desires; paribhavaù—paraphernalia; vipulaù—very great; ca—also; lobhaù—avarice; tävat—up to that time; mama—my; iti—thus; asat—perishable; avagrahaù—undertaking; ärti-mülam—full of anxieties; yävat—as long as; na—do not; te—Your; aìghrim abhayam—safe lotus feet; pravåëéta—take shelter; lokaù—the people of the world.

O my Lord, the people of the world are embarrassed by all material anxieties—they are always afraid. They always try to protect their wealth, body and friends, they are filled with lamentation and unlawful desires concerning their paraphernalia, and they avariciously base their undertakings on the perishable conceptions of "my" and "mine." As long as they do not take shelter of Your safe lotus feet, they are full of such anxieties.

PURPORT
One may question how one can always think of the Lord in regard to His name, fame, qualities, etc., if one is embarrassed by thoughts of family affairs. Everyone in the material world is full of thoughts about how to maintain his family, how to protect his wealth, how to keep pace with friends and relatives, etc. Thus he is always in fear and lamentation, trying to maintain the status quo. In answer to this question, this verse spoken by Brahmä is very appropriate.
A pure devotee of the Lord never thinks of himself as the proprietor of his home. He surrenders everything unto the supreme control of the Lord, and thus he has no fear for maintaining his family or protecting the interests of his family. Because of this surrender, he no longer has any attraction for wealth. Even if there is attraction for wealth, it is not for sense enjoyment, but for the service of the Lord. A pure devotee may appear to be attracted to accumulating wealth just like an ordinary man, but the difference is that a devotee acquires money for the service of the Lord whereas the ordinary man acquires money for his sense enjoyment. Thus the acquisition of wealth by a devotee is not a source of anxieties, as is the case for a worldly man. And because a pure devotee accepts everything for the purpose of serving the Lord, the poisonous teeth of accumulation of wealth are extracted. If a snake has its poisonous teeth removed and then bites a man, there is no fatal effect. Similarly, wealth accumulated for the cause of the Lord has no poisonous teeth, and the effect is not fatal. A pure devotee is never entangled in material worldly affairs, even though he may remain in the world like an ordinary man.

daivena—by fate of misfortune; te—they; hata-dhiyaù—bereft of memory; bhavataù—of You; prasaìgät—from the topics; sarva—all; açubha—inauspiciousness; upaçamanät—curbing down; vimukha—turned against; indriyäù—senses; ye—those; kurvanti—act; käma—sense gratification; sukha—happiness; leça—brief; laväya—for a moment only; dénäù—poor fellows; lobha-abhibhüta—overwhelmed by greed; manasaù—of one whose mind; akuçaläni—inauspicious activities; çaçvat—always.

O my Lord, persons who are bereft of the all-auspicious performance of chanting and hearing about Your transcendental activities are certainly unfortunate and are also bereft of good sense. They engage in inauspicious activities, enjoying sense gratification for a very little while.

PURPORT
The next question is why people are against such auspicious activities as chanting and hearing the glories and pastimes of the Lord, which can bring total freedom from the cares and anxieties of material existence. The only answer to this question is that they are unfortunate because of supernatural control due to their offensive activities performed simply for the sake of sense gratification. The Lord's pure devotees, however, take compassion upon such unfortunate persons and, in a missionary spirit, try to persuade them to take to the line of devotional service. Only by the grace of pure devotees can such unfortunate men be elevated to the position of transcendental service.

kñut—hunger; tåö—thirst; tri-dhätubhiù—three humors, namely mucus, bile and wind; imäù—all of them; muhuù—always; ardyamänäù—perplexed; çéta—winter; uñëa—summer; väta—wind; varañaiù—by rains; itara-itarät—and many other disturbances; ca—also; käma-agninä—by strong, indefatigable sex urges; acyuta-ruñä—indomitable anger; ca—also; sudurbhareëa—most unbearable; sampaçyataù—so observing; manaù—mind; urukrama—O great actor; sédate—becomes despondent; me—my.

O great actor, my Lord, all these poor creatures are constantly perplexed by hunger, thirst, severe cold, secretion and bile, attacked by coughing winter, blasting summer, rains and many other disturbing elements, and overwhelmed by strong, indefatigable sex urges and indomitable anger. I take pity on them, and I am very much aggrieved for them.

PURPORT
A pure devotee of the Lord like Brahmä and persons in his disciplic succession are always unhappy to see the perplexities of the conditioned souls, who are suffering the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, which pertain to the body and mind, to the disturbances of material nature, and to many other such material disadvantages. Not knowing adequate measures for relieving such difficulties, suffering persons sometimes pose themselves as leaders of the people, and the unfortunate followers are put into further disadvantages under such so-called leadership. This is like a blind man's leading another blind man to fall into a ditch. Therefore, unless the devotees of the Lord take pity on them and teach them the right path, their lives are hopeless failures. The devotees of the Lord who voluntarily take the responsibility of imparting good sense to the foolish materialistic sense enjoyers are as confidential to the Lord as Lord Brahmä.

yävat—as long as; påthaktvam—separatism; idam—this; ätmanaù—of the body; indriya-artha—for sense gratification; mäyä-balam—influence of external energy; bhagavataù—of the Personality of Godhead; janaù—a person; éça—O my Lord; paçyet—sees; tävat—so long; na—not; saàsåtiù—the influence of material existence; asau—that man; pratisaìkrameta—can overcome; vyarthä api—although without meaning; duùkha-nivaham—multiple miseries; vahaté—bringing; kriyä-arthä—for fruitive activities.

O my Lord, the material miseries are without factual existence for the soul. Yet as long as the conditioned soul sees the body as meant for sense enjoyment, he cannot get out of the entanglement of material miseries, being influenced by Your external energy.

PURPORT
The whole trouble of the living entity in material existence is that he has an independent conception of life. He is always dependent on the rules of the Supreme Lord, in both the conditioned and liberated states, but by the influence of the external energy the conditioned soul thinks himself independent of the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. His constitutional position is to dovetail himself with the desire of the supreme will, but as long as he does not do so, he is sure to drag on in the shackles of material bondage. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (2.55), prajahäti yadä kämän sarvän pärtha mano-gatän: he has to give up all sorts of plans manufactured by mental concoction. The living entity has to dovetail himself with the supreme will. That will help him to get out of the entanglement of material existence.

ahni—during the daytime; äpåta—engaged; ärta—distressing engagement; karaëäù—senses; niçi—at night; niùçayänäù—insomnia; nänä—various; manoratha—mental speculations; dhiyä—by intelligence; kñaëa—constantly; bhagna—broken; nidräù—sleep; daiva—superhuman; ähata-artha—frustrated; racanäù—plans; åñayaù—great sages; api—also; deva—O my Lord; yuñmat—Your Lordship's; prasaìga—topic; vimukhäù—turned against; iha—in this (material world); saàsaranti—do rotate.

Such nondevotees engage their senses in very troublesome and extensive work, and thus they suffer insomnia at night because their intelligence constantly breaks their sleep with various mental speculations. They are frustrated in all their various plans by supernatural power. Even great sages, if they are against Your transcendental topics, must rotate in this material world.

PURPORT
As described in previous verses, people who have no taste for the devotional service of the Lord are occupied in material engagements. Most of them engage during the daytime in hard physical labor; their senses are engaged very extensively in troublesome duties in the gigantic plants of heavy industrial enterprise. The owners of such factories are engaged in finding a market for their industrial products, and the laborers are engaged in extensive production involving huge mechanical arrangements. "Factory" is another name for hell. At night, hellishly engaged persons take advantage of wine and women to satisfy their tired senses, but they are not even able to have sound sleep because their various mental speculative plans constantly interrupt their sleep. Because they suffer from insomnia, sometimes they feel sleepy in the morning for lack of sufficient rest. By the arrangement of supernatural power, even the great scientists and thinkers of the world suffer frustration of their various plans and thus rot in the material world birth after birth. A great scientist may make discoveries in atomic energy for the quick destruction of the world and may be awarded the best prize in recognition of his service (or disservice), but he also has to undergo the reactions of his work by rotating in the cycle of repeated births and deaths under the superhuman law of material nature. All these people who are against the principle of devotional service are destined to rotate in this material world without fail.
This verse particularly mentions that even sages who are averse to the principles of devotional service to the Lord are also condemned to undergo the terms of material existence. Not only in this age, but formerly also, there were many sages who tried to invent their own systems of religion without reference to devotional service to the Supreme Lord. But there cannot be any religious principle without devotional service to the Lord. The Supreme Lord is the leader of the entire range of living entities, and no one can be equal to or greater than Him. Even the Lord's impersonal feature and all-pervading localized feature cannot be on an equal level with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there cannot be any religion or system of genuine philosophy for the advancement of the living entities without the principle of devotional service.
The impersonalists who take much trouble in penance and austerity for self-liberation may approach the impersonal brahma-jyoti, but ultimately, because of not being situated in devotional service, they glide down again to the material world to undergo another term of material existence. This is confirmed as follows:
ye 'nye 'ravindäkña vimukta-mäninas
tvayy asta-bhäväd aviçuddha-buddhayaù
äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù
patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù
"Persons who are falsely under the impression of being liberated without devotional service to the Lord may reach the goal of the brahma-jyoti, but because of their impure consciousness and for want of shelter in the Vaikuëöhalokas, such so-called liberated persons again fall down into material existence." (SB 10.2.32)
Therefore, no one can manufacture any system of religion without the principle of devotional service to the Lord. As we find in the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the initiator of religious principles is the Lord Himself. In the Bhagavad-gétä also we find that the Lord condemns all forms of religion other than that which entails the process of surrendering unto the Supreme. Any system which leads one to the devotional service of the Lord, and nothing else, is actually religion or philosophy. In the Sixth Canto we find the following statements of Yamaräja, the controller of all unfaithful living entities:
dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétaà
na vai vidur åñayo näpi deväù
na siddha-mukhyä asurä manuñyäù
kutaç ca vidyädhara-cäraëädayaù
svayambhür näradaù çambhuù
kumäraù kapilo manuù
prahlädo janako bhéñmo
balir vaiyäsakir vayam
dvädaçaite vijänémo
dharmaà bhägavataà bhaöäù
guhyaà viçuddhaà durbodhaà
yaà jïätvämåtam açnute
"The principles of religion are initiated solely by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore no one else, including the sages and demigods, can manufacture any religous principle. Since even the great sages and such demigods as Brahmä and Çiva are not authorized to inaugurate any principles of religion, what to speak of others—the so-called mystics, demons, human beings, Vidyädharas and Cäraëas living on lower planets? Twelve personalities—Brahmä, Närada, Lord Çiva, Kumära, Kapila, Manu, Prahläda Mahäräja, Janaka Mahäräja, Bhéñma, Bali, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Yamaräja—are agents of the Lord authorized to speak and propagate the principles of religion." (SB 6.3.19-21)
The principles of religion are not open to any ordinary living entity; a human being must first be brought onto the platform of morality. Nonviolence, etc., are necessary for misguided persons because unless one is moral and nonviolent one cannot understand the principles of religion. It is very difficult to understand what actual religion is, even if one is situated in the principles of morality and nonviolence. Actual religion is very confidential because as soon as one is conversant with the real principles of religion one is liberated and enters onto the path to the eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Therefore, one who is not situated in the principles of devotional service to the Lord should not pose himself as a religious leader of the innocent public. The Éçopaniñad emphatically forbids this nonsense in the following mantra:
andhaà tamaù praviçanti
ye 'sambhütim upäsate
tato bhüya iva te tamo
ya u sambhütyäà ratäù
(Éçopaniñad 12)
A person in ignorance of the principles of religion who therefore does nothing in the matter of religion is far better than a person who misguides others in the name of religion without reference to the factual religious principles of devotional service. Such so-called leaders of religion are sure to be condemned by Brahmä and other great authorities.

tvam—unto You; bhakti-yoga—in devotional service; paribhävita—being one hundred percent engaged; håt—of the heart; saroje—on the lotus; ässe—You reside; çruta-ékñita—seen through the ear; pathaù—the path; nanu—now; nätha—O my Lord; puàsäm—of the devotees; yat-yat—whichever; dhiyä—by meditating; te—Your; urugäya—O multiglorious; vibhävayanti—they specifically think of; tat-tat—the very same; vapuù—transcendental form; praëayase—do You manifest; sat-anugrahäya—to show Your causeless mercy.

O my Lord, Your devotees can see You through the ears by the process of bona fide hearing, and thus their hearts become cleansed and You take Your seat there. You are so merciful to Your devotees that You manifest Yourself in the particular eternal form of transcendence in which they always think of You.

PURPORT
The statement here that the Lord manifests Himself before the devotee in the form in which the devotee likes to worship Him indicates that the Lord becomes subordinate to the desire of the devotee—so much so that the Lord manifests His particular form as the devotee demands. This demand of the devotee is satisfied by the Lord because He is pliable in terms of the transcendental loving service of the devotee. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.11): ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. We should note, however, that the Lord is never the order supplier of the devotee. Here in this verse it is particularly mentioned: tvaà bhakti-yoga-paribhävita. This indicates the efficiency achieved through execution of mature devotional service, or prema, love of Godhead. This state of prema is achieved by the gradual process of development from faith to love. On faith one associates with bona fide devotees, and by such association one can become engaged in bona fide devotional service, which includes proper initiation and the execution of the primary devotional duties prescribed in the revealed scriptures. This is clearly indicated herein by the word çrutekñita. The çrutekñita path is to hear from bona fide devotees who are conversant with Vedic wisdom, free from mundane sentiment. By this bona fide hearing process, the neophyte devotee becomes cleansed of all material rubbish, and thus he becomes attached to one of the many transcendental forms of the Lord described in the Vedas.
This attachment of the devotee to a particular form of the Lord is due to natural inclination. Each and every living entity is originally attached to a particular type of transcendental service because he is eternally the servitor of the Lord. Lord Caitanya says that the living entity is eternally a servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. Therefore, every living entity has a particular type of service relationship with the Lord, eternally. This particular attachment is invoked by practice of regulative devotional service to the Lord, and thus the devotee becomes attached to the eternal form of the Lord, exactly like one who is already eternally attached. This attachment for a particular form of the Lord is called svarüpa-siddhi. The Lord sits on the lotus heart of the devotee in the eternal form the pure devotee desires, and thus the Lord does not part from the devotee, as confirmed in the previous verse. The Lord, however, does not disclose Himself to a casual or unauthentic worshiper to be exploited. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.25): nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya yoga-mäyä-samävåtaù. Rather, by yoga-mäyä, the Lord remains concealed from the nondevotees or casual devotees who are serving their sense gratification. The Lord is never visible to the pseudo devotees who worship the demigods in charge of universal affairs. The conclusion is that the Lord does not become the order supplier of a pseudo devotee but He is always prepared to respond to the desires of a pure, unconditional devotee free from all tinges of material infection.

nätiprasédati tathopacitopacärair
ärädhitaù sura-gaëair hådi baddha-kämaiù

na—never; ati—very much; prasédati—become satisfied; tathä—as much as; upacita—by pompous arrangement; upacäraiù—with much worshipable paraphernalia; ärädhitaù—being worshiped; sura-gaëaiù—by the celestial demigods; hådi baddha-kämaiù—with hearts full of all sorts of material desires; yat—that which; sarva—all; bhüta—living entities; dayayä—to show them causeless mercy; asat—nondevotee; alabhyayä—not being achieved; ekaù—one without a second; nänä—various; janeñu—in living entities; avahitaù—perceived; suhåt—well-wishing friend; antaù—within; ätmä—Supersoul.

My Lord, You are not very much satisfied when You are worshiped by the demigods, who arrange for Your worship very pompously, with various paraphernalia, but who are full of material hankerings. As the Supersoul You are situated in the heart of all living beings just to show them Your causeless mercy, and You are their eternal well-wisher, but You are unavailable for the nondevotee.

PURPORT
The demigods in the celestial heavenly planets, who are appointed administrators of the material affairs, are also devotees of the Lord. But at the same time they have desires for material opulence and sense gratification. The Lord is so kind that He awards them all sorts of material happiness, more than they can desire, but He is not satisfied with them because they are not pure devotees. The Lord does not want any one of His innumerable sons (the living entities) to remain in the material world of threefold miseries to perpetually suffer the material pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. The demigods in the heavenly planets, and many devotees on this planet also, want to remain in the material world as devotees of the Lord and take advantage of material happiness. They do so at the risk of falling down to the lower status of existence, and this makes the Lord dissatisfied with them.
Pure devotees are not desirous of any material enjoyment, nor are they averse to it. They completely dovetail their desires with the desires of the Lord and perform nothing on their personal account. Arjuna is a good example. On his own sentiment, due to family affection, Arjuna did not want to fight, but finally, after hearing Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä, he agreed to fight in the interests of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord is very much satisfied with pure devotees because they do not act for sense gratification but only in terms of the Lord's desire. As Paramätmä, or Supersoul, He is situated in everyone's heart, always giving everyone the chance of good counsel. Thus everyone should take the opportunity and render transcendental loving service to Him wholly and solely.
The nondevotees, however, are like neither the demigods nor the pure devotees but are averse to any transcendental relationship with the Lord. They have revolted against the Lord and must perpetually undergo the reactions of their own activities.
The Bhagavad-gétä (4.11) states, ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham: "Although the Lord is equally kind to every living being, the living beings, for their own part, are able to please the Lord to either a greater or lesser extent." The demigods are called sakäma devotees, or devotees with material desires in mind, while the pure devotees are called niñkäma devotees because they have no desires for their personal interests. The sakäma devotees are self-interested because they do not think of others, and therefore they are not able to satisfy the Lord perfectly, whereas the pure devotees take the missionary responsibility of turning nondevotees into devotees, and they are therefore able to satisfy the Lord more than the demigods. The Lord is unmindful of the nondevotees, although He is sitting within everyone's heart as well-wisher and Supersoul. However, He also gives them the chance to receive His mercy through His pure devotees who are engaged in missionary activities. Sometimes the Lord Himself descends for missionary activities, as He did in the form of Lord Caitanya, but mostly He sends His bona fide representatives, and thus He shows His causeless mercy towards the nondevotees. The Lord is so satisfied with His pure devotees that He wants to give them the credit for missionary success, although He could do the work personally. This is the sign of His satisfaction with His pure, niñkäma devotees, compared to the sakäma devotees. By such transcendental activities the Lord simultaneously becomes free from the charge of partiality and exhibits His pleasure with the devotees.
Now a question arises: If the Lord is sitting in the hearts of nondevotees, why are they not moved to become devotees? It may be answered that the stubborn nondevotees are like barren land or an alkaline field, where no agricultural activities can be successful. As part and parcel of the Lord, every individual living entity has a minute quantity of independence, and by misuse of this minute independence the nondevotees commit offense after offense, to both the Lord and His pure devotees engaged in missionary work. As a result of such acts, they become as barren as an alkaline field, where there is no strength to produce.

puàsäm—of the people; ataù—therefore; vividha-karmabhiù—by various fruitive activities; adhvara-ädyaiù—by performance of Vedic rituals; dänena—by charities; ca—and; ugra—very hard; tapasä—austerity; paricaryayä—by transcendental service; ca—also; ärädhanam—worship; bhagavataù—of the Personality of Godhead; tava—Your; sat-kriyä-arthaù—simply for pleasing Your Lordship; dharmaù—religion; arpitaù—so offered; karhicit—at any time; mriyate—vanquishes; na—never; yatra—there.

But the pious activities of the people, such as performance of Vedic rituals, charity, austere penances, and transcendental service, performed with a view to worship You and satisfy You by offering You the fruitive results, are also beneficial. Such acts of religion never go in vain.

PURPORT
Absolute devotional service, conducted in nine different spiritual activities—hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, praying, etc.—does not always appeal to people with a pompous nature; they are more attracted by the Vedic sacrificial rituals and other costly performances of social religious shows. But the process according to the Vedic injunctions is that the fruits of all such pious activities should be offered to the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä (9.27), the Lord demands that whatever one may do in one's daily activities, such as worship, sacrifice, and offering charity, all the results should be offered to Him only. This offering of the results of pious acts unto the Supreme Lord is a sign of devotional service to the Lord and is of permanent value, whereas enjoying the same results for oneself is only temporary. Anything done on account of the Lord is a permanent asset and accumulates in the form of unseen piety for gradual promotion to the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. These undetected pious activities will one day result in full-fledged devotional service by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, any pious act done on account of the Supreme Lord is also recommended here for those who are not pure devotees.

Let me offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Transcendence, who is eternally distinguished by His internal potency. His indistinguishable impersonal feature is realized by intelligence for self-realization. I offer my obeisances unto Him, who by His pastimes enjoys the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is eternally distinguished from the living entities by His internal potency, although He is also understood in His impersonal feature by self-realized intelligence. Devotees of the Lord, therefore, offer all respectful obeisances unto the impersonal feature of the Lord. The word räsa is significant herein. The räsa dance is performed by Lord Kåñëa in the company of the cowherd damsels of Våndävana, and the Personality of Godhead Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu is also engaged in räsa enjoyment with His external potency, by which He creates, maintains and dissolves the entire material manifestation. Indirectly, Lord Brahmä offers his respectful obeisances unto Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is factually ever engaged in räsa enjoyment with the gopés, as confirmed in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad in the following words: parärdhänte so 'budhyata gopa-veço me puruñaù purastäd ävirbabhüva. The distinction between the Lord and the living entity is definitely experienced when there is sufficient intelligence to understand His internal potency, as distinguished from the external potency, by which He makes possible the material manifestation.

Let me take shelter of the lotus feet of Him whose incarnations, qualities and activities are mysterious imitations of worldly affairs. One who invokes His transcendental names, even unconsciously, at the time he quits this life, is certainly washed immediately of the sins of many, many births and attains Him without fail.

PURPORT
The activities of the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are a kind of imitation of the activities going on in the material world. He is just like an actor on a stage. An actor imitates the activities of a king on stage, although actually he is not the king. Similarly, when the Lord incarnates, He imitates parts with which He has nothing to do. In the Bhagavad-gétä (4.14), it is said that the Lord has nothing to do with the activities in which He is supposedly engaged: na mäà karmäëi limpanti na me karma-phale spåhä. The Lord is omnipotent: simply by His will He can perform anything and everything. When the Lord appeared as Lord Kåñëa, He played the part of the son of Yaçodä and Nanda, and He lifted the Govardhana Hill, although lifting a hill is not His concern. He can lift millions of Govardhana Hills by His simple desire; He does not need to lift it with His hand. But He imitates the ordinary living entity by this lifting, and at the same time He exhibits His supernatural power. Thus His name is chanted as “the lifter of Govardhana Hill,” or Çré Govardhana-dhäré. Therefore, His acts in His incarnations and His partiality to the devotees are all imitations only, just like the acts of an expert dramatic player on a stage. His acts in that capacity, however, are all omnipotent, and the remembrance of such activities of the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is as powerful as the Lord Himself. Ajämila remembered the holy name of the Lord, Näräyaëa, by merely calling the name of his son Näräyaëa, and that gave him a complete opportunity to achieve the highest perfection of life.

Your Lordship is the prime root of the tree of the planetary systems. This tree has grown by first penetrating the material nature in three trunks—as me, as You (the Almighty) and as Çiva—for creation, maintenance and dissolution, and we three have grown with many branches. Therefore I offer my obeisances unto You, the tree of the cosmic manifestation. manifestation.

PURPORT
The tree of the cosmic manifestation is grossly divided into three worlds, the upper, lower and middle planetary systems, and then it broadens into the cosmos of fourteen planetary systems, with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme root. Material nature, which appears to be the cause of the cosmic manifestation, is only the agent or energy of the Lord. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.10): mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram. "Acting under the superintendence of the Supreme Lord, material nature appears to be the cause of all creation, maintenance and dissolution." The Lord expands Himself into three—Viñëu, Brahmä and Çiva—for maintenance, creation and destruction respectively. Of the three principal agents controlling the three modes of material nature, Viñëu is the Almighty; even though He is within material nature for the purpose of maintenance, He is not controlled by the laws of material nature. The other two, Brahmä and Çiva, although almost as greatly powerful as Viñëu, are within the control of the material energy of the Supreme Lord, as are such secondary agents as the Manus, Marici and the great sages. Therefore the conception of many gods controlling the many departments of material nature is ill conceived of by the foolish pantheist. God is one without a second, and He is the primal cause of all causes. As there are many departmental heads of governmental affairs, so there are many heads of management of the universal affairs.
Due to a poor fund of knowledge, the impersonalist does not believe in the personal management of things as they are. But in this verse it is clearly explained that everything is personal and nothing is impersonal. We have already discussed this point in the Introduction, and it is confirmed here in this verse. The tree of the material manifestation is described in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä as an açvattha tree whose root is upward. We have actual experience of such a tree when we see the reflection, or shadow, of a tree on the surface of a reservoir of water. The reflection of the tree on the water appears to hang down from its upward roots. The description of the tree of creation in the Bhagavad-gétä proves that this material world is only a shadow of the reality, which is Para-brahman, Viñëu. In the manifestation of His internal potency known as the Vaikuëöhalokas, the actual tree exists, and the tree of the material nature is only a shadow of this actual tree. The impersonalists' theory that Brahman is void of all variegatedness is false because the shadow-tree described in the Bhagavad-gétä cannot exist without there being a real tree. The real tree is situated in the eternal existence of the spiritual nature, full of transcendental varieties, and Lord Viñëu is the root of that tree also. The root is the same-the Lord-both for the real tree and the false, but the false tree is only the perverted reflection of the real tree. The Lord, being the real tree, is here offered obeisances by Brahmä on his own behalf, and also on behalf of Lord Çiva.

People in general all engage in foolish acts, not in the really beneficial activities enunciated directly by You for their guidance. As long as their tendency for foolish work remains powerful, all their plans in the struggle for existence will be cut to pieces. I therefore offer my obeisances unto Him who acts as eternal time.

PURPORT
People in general are all engaged in senseless work. They are systematically unmindful of the real beneficial work, which is the devotional service of the Lord, technically called the arcana regulations. The arcana regulations are directly instructed by the Lord in the Närada Païcarätra and are strictly followed by the intelligent men, who know well that the highest perfectional goal of life is to reach Lord Viñëu, who is the root of the tree called the cosmic manifestation. Also, in the Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä such regulative activities are clearly mentioned. Foolish people do not know that their self-interest is in realization of Viñëu. The Bhägavatam (7.5.30-32) says:

"Persons who are determined to totally rot in false, material happiness cannot become Kåñëa-minded either by instructions from teachers, by self-realization or by parliamentary discussions. They are dragged by the unbridled senses into the darkest region of ignorance, and thus they madly engage in what is called 'chewing the chewed.'
"Because of their foolish activities, they are unaware that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve Viñëu, the Lord of the cosmic manifestation, and so their struggle for existence is in the wrong direction of material civilization, which is under the external energy. They are led by similar foolish persons, just as one blind man is led by another blind man and both fall into a ditch.
"Such foolish men cannot be attracted towards the activities of the Supreme Powerful, who is actually the neutralizing measure for their foolish activities, unless and until they have the good sense to be guided by the great souls who are completely freed from material attachment."
In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord asks everyone to give up all other occupational duties and absolutely engage in arcana activities, or in pleasing the Lord. But almost no one is attracted to such arcana activity. Everyone is more or less attracted by activities which are conditions of rebellion against the Supreme Lord. The systems of jïäna and yoga are also indirectly rebellious acts against the Lord. There is no auspicious activity except arcana of the Lord. Jïäna and yoga are sometimes accepted within the purview of arcana when the ultimate aim is Viñëu, and not otherwise. The conclusion is that only the devotees of the Lord are bona fide human beings eligible for salvation. Others are vainly struggling for existence without any actual benefit.

yasmät—from whom; bibhemi—fear; aham—I; api—also; dvi-para-ardha—up to the limit of 4,320,000,000 x 2 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years; dhiñëyam—place; adhyäsitaù—situated in; sakala-loka—all other planets; namaskåtam—honored by; yat—that; tepe—underwent; tapaù—penances; bahu-savaù—many, many years; avarurutsamänaù—desiring to obtain You; tasmai—unto Him; namaù—I do offer my obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhimakhäya—unto Him who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices; tubhyam—unto Your Lordship.

Your Lordship, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You who are indefatigable time and the enjoyer of all sacrifices. Although I am situated in an abode which will continue to exist for a time duration of two parärdhas, although I am the leader of all other planets in the universe, and although I have undergone many, many years of penance for self-realization, still I offer my respects unto You.

PURPORT
Brahmä is the greatest personality in the universe because he has the longest duration of life. He is the most respectable personality because of his penance, influence, prestige, etc., and still he has to offer his respectful obeisances unto the Lord. Therefore, it is incumbent upon all others, who are far, far below the standard of Brahmä, to do as he did and offer respects as a matter of duty.

O my Lord, by Your own will You appear in the various species of living entities—lower animals, human beings, demigods and others—to perform Your transcendental pastimes. You are not affected by material contamination. You come just to fulfill the obligations of Your own principles of religion, and therefore, O Supreme Personality, I offer my obeisances unto You for manifesting such different forms.

PURPORT
The Lord's incarnations in different species of life are all transcendental. He appears as a human being in His incarnations of Kåñëa, Räma, etc., but He is not a human being. Anyone who mistakes Him for an ordinary human being is certainly not very intelligent, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.11): avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam. The same principle is applicable when He appears as the hog or fish incarnation. They are transcendental forms of the Lord and are manifested under certain necessities of His own pleasure and pastimes. Such manifestations of the transcendental forms of the Lord are accepted by Him mostly to enliven His devotees. All His incarnations are manifested whenever there is a need to deliver His devotees and maintain His own principles.

My Lord, You accept the pleasure of sleeping in the water of devastation, where there are violent waves, and You enjoy pleasure on the bed of snakes, showing the happiness of Your sleep to intelligent persons. At that time, all the universal planets are stationed within Your abdomen.

PURPORT
Persons who cannot think of anything beyond the limit of their own power are like frogs in a well who cannot imagine the length and breadth of the great Pacific Ocean. Such people take it as legendary when they hear that the Supreme Lord is lying on His bed within the great ocean of the universe. They are surprised that one can lie down within water and sleep very happily. But a little intelligence can mitigate this foolish astonishment. There are many living entities within the ocean who also enjoy the material bodily activities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating. If such insignificant living entities can enjoy life within the water, why can't the Supreme Lord, who is all-powerful, enjoy sleeping on the cool body of a serpent amidst the turmoil of violent ocean waves? The distinction of the Lord is that His activities are all transcendental and He is able to do anything and everything without being deterred by limitations of time and space. He can enjoy His transcendental happiness regardless of material considerations.

O object of my worship, I am born from the house of Your lotus navel for the purpose of creating the universe by Your mercy. All these planets of the universe were stationed within Your transcendental abdomen while You were enjoying sleep. Now, Your sleep having ended, Your eyes are opening like lotuses blossoming in the morning.

PURPORT
Brahmä is teaching us the beginning of arcana regulations from morning (four o'clock) to night (ten o'clock). Early in the morning, the devotee has to rise from his bed and pray to the Lord, and there are other regulative principles for offering maìgala-ärati early in the morning. Foolish nondevotees, not understanding the importance of arcana, criticize the regulative principles, but they have no eyes to see that the Lord also sleeps, by His own will. The impersonal conception of the Supreme is so detrimental to the path of devotional service that it is very difficult to associate with the stubborn nondevotees, who always think in terms of material conceptions.
Impersonalists always think backwards. They think that because there is form in matter, spirit should be formless; because in matter there is sleep, in spirit there cannot be sleep; and because the sleeping of the Deity is accepted in arcana worship, the arcana is mäyä. All these thoughts are basically material. To think of matter either positively or negatively is still thinking materially. Knowledge accepted from the superior source of the Vedas is standard. Here in these verses of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, we find that arcana is recommended. Before Brahmä took up the task of creation, he found the Lord sleeping on the serpent bed in the waves of the water of devastation. Therefore, sleeping exists in the internal potency of the Lord, and this is not denied by pure devotees of the Lord like Brahmä and his disciplic succession. It is clearly said here that the Lord slept very happily within the violent waves of the water, thereby demonstrating that He is able to do anything and everything by His transcendental will and not be hampered by any circumstances. The Mäyävädé cannot think beyond his material experience, and thus he denies the Lord's ability to sleep within the water. His mistake is that he compares the Lord to himself—and that comparison is also a material thought. The whole philosophy of the Mäyäväda school, based on "not this, not that" (neti neti), is basically material. Such thought cannot give one the chance to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is.

saù—He; ayam—the Lord; samasta-jagatäm—of all the universes; suhåt ekaù—the one friend and philosopher; ätmä—the Supersoul; sattvena—by the mode of goodness; yat—one who; måòayate—causes happiness; bhagavän—the Personality of Godhead; bhagena—with six opulences; tena—by Him; eva—certainly; me—to me; dåçam—power of introspection; anuspåçatät—let Him give; yathä—as; aham—I; srakñyämi—will be able to create; pürva-vat—as before; idam—this universe; praëata—surrendered; priyaù—dear; asau—He (the Lord).

Let the Supreme Lord be merciful towards me. He is the one friend and soul of all living entities in the world, and by His six transcendental opulences He maintains all for their ultimate happiness. May He be merciful towards me so that I, as before, may be empowered with the introspection to create, for I am also one of the surrendered souls who are dear to the Lord.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, Puruñottama, or Çré Kåñëa, is the maintainer of all, in both the transcendental and material worlds. He is the life and friend of all because there is eternally natural affection and love between the living entities and the Lord. He is the one friend and well-wisher for all, and He is one without a second. The Lord maintains all the living entities everywhere by His six transcendental opulences, for which He is known as Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmä prayed for His mercy so that Brahmä might be able to create the universal affairs as he did before; only by the Lord's causeless mercy could he create both material and spiritual personalities like Maréci and Närada respectively. Brahmä prayed to the Lord is very dear to the surrendered soul. The surrendered soul knows nothing but the Lord, and therefore the Lord is very affectionate towards him.

eñaù—this; prapanna—one who is surrendered; vara-daù—benefactor; ramayä—enjoying always with the goddess of fortune (Lakñmé); ätma-çaktyä—with His internal potency; yat yat—whatever; kariñyati—He may act; gåhéta—accepting; guëa-avatäraù—incarnation of the mode of goodness; tasmin—unto Him; sva-vikramam—with omnipotency; idam—this cosmic manifestation; såjataù—creating; api—in spite of; cetaù—heart; yuïjéta—be engaged; karma—work; çamalam—material influence; ca—also; yathä—as much as; vijahyäm—I can give up.

The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is always the benefactor of the surrendered souls. His activities are always enacted through His internal potency, Ramä, the goddess of fortune. I pray only to engage in His service in the creation of the material world, and I pray that I not be materially affected by my work, for thus I may be able to give up the false prestige of being the creator.

PURPORT
In the matter of material creation, maintenance and destruction, there are three incarnations of the material modes of nature—Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara. But the Lord's incarnation as Viñëu, in His internal potency, is the supreme energy for all activities. Brahmä, who is only an assistant in the matter of creation, wanted to remain in his actual position as an instrument of the Lord instead of becoming puffed up by the false prestige of thinking himself the creator. That is the way of becoming dear to the Supreme Lord and receiving His full benediction. Foolish men want to take credit for all creations made by them, but intelligent persons know very well that not a blade of grass can move without the will of the Lord; thus all the credit for wonderful creations must go to Him. By spiritual consciousness only can one be free from the contamination of material influences and receive the benedictions offered by the Lord.

näbhi-hradät—from the navel lake; iha—in this millennium; sataù—lying; ambhasi—in the water; yasya—one whose; puàsaù—of the Personality of Godhead; vijïäna—of the total universe; çaktiù—energy; aham—I; äsam—was born; ananta—unlimited; çakteù—of the powerful; rüpam—form; vicitram—variegated; idam—this; asya—His; vivåëvataù—manifesting; me—unto me; mä—may not; rériñéñöa—vanish; nigamasya—of the Vedas; giräm—of the sounds; visargaù—vibration.

The Lord's potencies are innumerable. As He lies down in the water of devastation, I am born as the total universal energy from the navel lake in which the lotus sprouts. I am now engaged in manifesting His diverse energies in the form of the cosmic manifestation. I therefore pray that in the course of my material activities I may not be deviated from the vibration of the Vedic hymns.

PURPORT
Every person engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord in this material world is prone to so many material activities, and if one is not strong enough to protect himself against the onslaught of material influence, he may be diverted from the spiritual energy. In the material creation Brahmä has to create all kinds of living entities with bodies suitable to their material conditions. Brahmä wants to be protected by the Lord because he has to contact many, many vicious living entities. An ordinary brähmaëa may fall from the brahma-tejas, or the power of brahminical excellence, due to his association with many fallen, conditioned souls. Brahmä, as the supermost brähmaëa, is afraid of such a falldown, and therefore he prays to the Lord for protection. This is a warning for one and all in the spiritual advancement of life. Unless one is sufficiently protected by the Lord, he may fall down from his spiritual position; therefore one has to pray constantly to the Lord for protection and the blessing to carry out one's duty. Lord Caitanya also entrusted His missionary work to His devotees and assured them of His protection against the onslaught of material influence. The path of spiritual life is stated in the Vedas to be like the edge of a sharpened razor. A little inattentiveness may at once create havoc and bloodshed, but one who is a completely surrendered soul, always seeking protection from the Lord in the discharge of his entrusted duties, has no fear of falling into material contamination.

saù—He (the Lord); asau—that; adabhra—unlimited; karuëaù—merciful; bhagavän—the Personality of Godhead; vivåddha—excessive; prema—love; smitena—by smiling; nayana-amburuham—the lotus eyes; vijåmbhan—by opening; utthäya—for flourishing; viçva-vijayäya—for glorifying the cosmic creation; ca—as also; naù—our; viñädam—dejection; mädhvyä—by sweet; girä—words; apanayatät—let Him kindly remove; puruñaù—the Supreme; puräëaù—oldest.

The Lord, who is supreme and is the oldest of all, is unlimitedly merciful. I wish that He may smilingly bestow His benediction upon me by opening His lotus eyes. He can uplift the entire cosmic creation and kindly remove our dejection by sweetly speaking His directions.

PURPORT
The Lord is ever-increasingly merciful upon the fallen souls of this material world. The whole cosmic manifestation is a chance for all to improve themselves in devotional service to the Lord, and everyone is meant for that purpose. The Lord expands Himself into many personalities who are either self-expansions or separated expansions. The personalities of the individual souls are His separated expansions, whereas the self-expansions are the Lord Himself. The self-expansions are predominators, and the separated expansions are predominated for reciprocation of transcendental bliss with the supreme form of bliss and knowledge. The liberated souls can join in this blissful reciprocation of predominator and predominated without materially concocted ideas. The typical example of such a transcendental exchange between the predominator and the predominated is the Lord's räsa-lélä with the gopés. The gopés are predominated expansions of the internal potency, and therefore the Lord's participation in the räsa-lélä dance is never to be considered like the mundane relationship of man and woman. It is, rather, the highest perfectional stage of the exchange of feelings between the Lord and the living entities. The Lord gives the fallen souls the chance for this highest perfection of life. Lord Brahmä is entrusted with the management of the complete cosmic show, and therefore he prays that the Lord bestow His blessings upon him so that he may execute its purpose.

All the sages uttered with great respect: O unconquerable enjoyer of all sacrifices, all glories and all victories unto You! You are moving in Your form of the personified Vedas, and in the hair holes of Your body the oceans are submerged. For certain reasons [to uplift the earth] You have now assumed the form of a boar.

PURPORT
The Lord can assume any form He likes, and in all circumstances He is the cause of all causes. Since His form is transcendental, He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He is in the Causal Ocean in the form of Mahä-Viñëu. Innumerable universes are generated from the holes of His bodily hairs, and thus His transcendental body is the Vedas personified. He is the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and He is the unconquerable Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is never to be misunderstood as someone other than the Supreme Lord because of His assuming the form of a boar to lift the earth. That is the clear understanding of sages and great personalities like Brahmä and other residents of the higher planetary systems.

rüpam—form; tava—Your; etat—this; nanu—but; duñkåta-ätmanäm—of souls who are simply miscreants; durdarçanam—very difficult to see; deva—O Lord; yat—that; adhvara-ätmakam—worshipable by performances of sacrifice; chandäàsi—the Gäyatré mantra and others; yasya—whose; tvaci—touch of the skin; barhiù—sacred grass called kuça; romasu—hairs on the body; äjyam—clarified butter; dåçi—in the eyes; tu—also; aìghriñu—on the four legs; cätuù-hotram—four kinds of fruitive activities.

O Lord, Your form is worshipable by performances of sacrifice, but souls who are simply miscreants are unable to see it. All the Vedic hymns, Gäyatré and others, are in the touch of Your skin. In Your bodily hairs is the kuça grass, in Your eyes is the clarified butter, and in Your four legs are the four kinds of fruitive activities.

PURPORT
There is a class of miscreants who are known in the words of the Bhagavad-gétä as veda-väda-ratas, or so-called strict followers of the Vedas. They do not believe in the incarnation of the Lord, what to speak of the Lord's incarnation as the worshipable hog. They describe worship of the different forms or incarnations of the Lord as anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. In the estimation of Çrémad-Bhägavatam these men are miscreants, and in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.15) they are called not only miscreants but also fools and the lowest of mankind, and it is said that their knowledge has been plundered by illusion due to their atheistic temperament. For such condemned persons, the Lord's incarnation as the gigantic hog is invisible. These strict followers of the Vedas who despise the eternal forms of the Lord may know from Çrémad-Bhägavatam that such incarnations are personified forms of the Vedas. Lord Boar's skin, His eyes and His bodily hair holes are all described here as different parts of the Vedas. He is therefore the personified form of the Vedic hymns, especially the Gäyatré mantra.

O Lord, Your tongue is a plate of sacrifice, Your nostrils are another plate of sacrifice, in Your belly is the eating plate of sacrifice, and Your ear-holes are another plate of sacrifice. In Your mouth is the Brahmä plate of sacrifice, Your throat is the plate of sacrifice known as soma, and whatever You chew is known as agni-hotra.

PURPORT
The veda-väda-ratas say that there is nothing more than the Vedas and the performances of sacrifice mentioned in the Vedas. They have recently made a rule in their group to formally observe daily sacrifice; they simply ignite a small fire and offer something whimsically, but they do not strictly follow the sacrificial rules and regulations mentioned in the Vedas. It is understood that by regulation there are different plates of sacrifice required, such as srak, sruvä, barhis, cätur-hotra, iòä, camasa, präçitra, graha and agni-hotra. One cannot achieve the results of sacrifice unless one observes the strict regulations. In this age there is practically no facility for performing sacrifices in strict discipline. Therefore, in this Age of Kali there is a stricture regarding such sacrifices: it is explicitly directed that one should perform saìkértana-yajïa and nothing more. The incarnation of the Supreme Lord is Yajïeçvara, and unless one has respect for the incarnation of the Lord, one cannot perfectly perform sacrifice. In other words, taking shelter of the Lord and rendering service unto Him is the factual performance of all sacrifices, as explained herein. Different plates of sacrifice correspond to the different parts of the body of the Lord's incarnation. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Eleventh Canto, it is explicitly directed that one should perform saìkértana-yajïa to please the Lord's incarnation as Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. This should be rigidly followed in order to achieve the result of yajïa performance.

dékñä—initiation; anujanma—spiritual birth, or repeated incarnations; upasadaù—three kinds of desires (relationship, activities and ultimate goal); çiraù-dharam—the neck; tvam—You; präyaëéya—after the result of initiation; udayanéya—the last rites of desires; daàñöraù—the tusks; jihvä—the tongue; pravargyaù—prior activities; tava—Your; çérñakam—head; kratoù—of the sacrifice; satya—fire without sacrifice; ävasathyam—fire of worship; citayaù—aggregate of all desires; asavaù—life breath; hi—certainly; te—Your.

Moreover, O Lord, Your repeated appearances are the desire for all kinds of initiation. Your neck is the place for three desires, and Your tusks are the result of initiation and the end of all desires. Your tongue is the activities prior to initiation, Your head is the fire without sacrifice as well as the fire of worship, and Your living forces are the aggregate of all desires.

somaù tu retaù—Your semen is the sacrifice called soma; savanäni—ritualistic performances in the morning; avasthitiù—different statuses of bodily growth; saàsthä-vibhedäù—seven varieties of sacrifice; tava—Your; deva—O Lord; dhätavaù—ingredients of the body such as skin and flesh; saträëi—sacrifices performed over twelve days; sarväëi—all of them; çaréra—the bodily; sandhiù—joints; tvam—Your Lordship; sarva—all; yajïa—asoma sacrifices; kratuù—soma sacrifices; iñöi—the ultimate desire; bandhanaù—attachment.

O Lord, Your semen is the sacrifice called soma-yajïa. Your growth is the ritualistic performances of the morning. Your skin and touch sensations are the seven elements of the agniñöoma sacrifice. Your bodily joints are symbols of various other sacrifices performed over twelve days. Therefore You are the object of all sacrifices called soma and asoma, and You are bound by yajïas only.

PURPORT
There are seven kinds of routine yajïas performed by all followers of the Vedic rituals, and they are called agniñöoma, atyagniñöoma, uktha, ñoòaçé, väjapeya, atirätra and äptoryäma. Anyone performing such yajïas regularly is said to be situated with the Lord. But anyone who is in contact with the Supreme Lord by discharging devotional service is understood to have performed all different varieties of yajïas.

O Lord, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are worshipable by universal prayers, Vedic hymns and sacrificial ingredients. We offer our obeisances unto You. You can be realized by the pure mind freed from all visible and invisible material contamination. We offer our respectful obeisances to You as the supreme spiritual master of knowledge in devotional service.

PURPORT
The qualification of bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord, is that the devotee should be free from all material contaminations and desires. This freedom is called vairägya, or renouncement of material desires. One who engages in devotional service to the Lord according to regulative principles is automatically freed from material desires, and in that pure state of mind one can realize the Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone's heart, instructs the devotee regarding pure devotional service so that he may ultimately achieve the association of the Lord. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (10.10) as follows:
teñäà satata-yuktänäà
bhajatäà préti-pürvakam
dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà
yena mäm upayänti te
"To one who constantly engages in the devotional service of the Lord with faith and love, the Lord certainly gives the intelligence to achieve Him at the ultimate end."
One has to conquer the mind, and one may do it by following the Vedic rituals and by performing different types of sacrifice. The ultimate end of all those performances is to attain bhakti, or the devotional service of the Lord. Without bhakti one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The original Personality of Godhead or His innumerable Viñëu expansions are the only objects of worship by all the Vedic rituals and sacrificial performances.

daàñörägra-koöyä bhagavaàs tvayä dhåtä
viräjate bhüdhara bhüù sa-bhüdharä
yathä vanän niùsarato datä dhåtä
mataì-gajendrasya sa-patra-padminé


daàñöra-agra—the tips of the tusks; koöyä—by the edges; bhagavan—O Personality of Godhead; tvayä—by You; dhåtä—sustained; viräjate—is so beautifully situated; bhü-dhara—O lifter of the earth; bhüù—the earth; sa-bhüdharä—with mountains; yathä—as much as; vanät—from the water; niùsarataù—coming out; datä—by the tusk; dhåtä—captured; matam-gajendrasya—infuriated elephant; sa-patra—with leaves; padminé—the lotus flower.

O lifter of the earth, the earth with its mountains, which You have lifted with Your tusks, is situated as beautifully as a lotus flower with leaves sustained by the tusk of an infuriated elephant just coming out of the water.

PURPORT
The fortune of the earth planet is praised because of its being specifically sustained by the Lord; its beauty is appreciated and compared to that of a lotus flower situated on the tusk of an elephant. As a lotus flower with leaves is very beautifully situated on the tusk of an elephant, so the world, with its many beautiful mountains, appeared similarly situated on the tusks of Lord Boar.

trayé-mayam—Vedas personified; rüpam—form; idam—this; ca—also; saukaram—the boar; bhü-maëòalena—by the earth planet; atha—now; datä—by the tusk; dhåtena—sustained by; te—Your; cakästi—is glowing; çåìga-üòha—sustained by the peaks; ghanena—by the clouds; bhüyasä—more glorified; kula-acala-indrasya—of the great mountains; yathä—as much as; eva—certainly; vibhramaù—decoration.

O Lord, as the peaks of great mountains become beautiful when decorated with clouds, Your transcendental body has become beautiful because of Your lifting the earth on the edge of Your tusks.

PURPORT
The word vibhramaù is significant. Vibhramaù means "illusion" as well as "beauty." When a cloud rests on the peak of a great mountain, the cloud appears to be sustained by the mountain, and at the same time it looks very beautiful. Similarly, the Lord has no need to sustain the earth on His tusks, but when He does so the world becomes beautiful, just as the Lord becomes more beautiful because of His pure devotees on the earth. Although the Lord is the transcendental personification of the Vedic hymns, He has become more beautiful because of His appearance to sustain the earth.

lokäya patném asi mätaraà pitä

saàsthäpaya enäm—raise this earth; jagatäm—the moving; sa-tasthuñäm—and the nonmoving; lokäya—for their residence; patném—wife; asi—You are; mätaram—the mother; pitä—the father; vidhema—we offer; ca—also; asyai—unto the mother; namasä—with all obeisances; saha—along with; tvayä—with You; yasyäm—in whom; sva-tejaù—by Your own potency; agnim—fire; iva—likened; araëau—in the araëi wood; adhäù—invested.

O Lord, for the residential purposes of all inhabitants, both moving and nonmoving, this earth is Your wife, and You are the supreme father. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You, along with mother earth, in whom You have invested Your own potency, just as an expert sacrificer puts fire in the araëi wood.
PURPORT
The so-called law of gravitation which sustains the planets is described herein as the potency of the Lord. This potency is invested by the Lord in the same way that an expert sacrificial brähmaëa puts fire in the araëi wood by the potency of Vedic mantras. By this arrangement the world becomes habitable for both the moving and nonmoving creatures. The conditioned souls, who are residents of the material world, are put into the womb of mother earth in the same way the seed of a child is put by the father into the womb of the mother. This conception of the Lord and the earth as father and mother is explained in Bhagavad-gétä (14.4). Conditioned souls are devoted to the motherland in which they take their birth, but they do not know their father. The mother is not independent in producing children. Similarly, material nature cannot produce living creatures unless in contact with the supreme father, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çrémad-Bhägavatam teaches us to offer obeisances unto the father, the Supreme Lord, along with the mother, because it is the supreme father only who impregnates the mother with all energies for the sustenance and maintenance of all living beings, both moving and nonmoving.

kaù—who else; çraddadhéta—can endeavor; anyatamaù—anyone besides Yourself; tava—Your; prabho—O Lord; rasäm—in the water; gatäyäù—while lying in; bhuvaù—of the earth; udvibarhaëam—deliverance; na—never; vismayaù—wonderful; asau—such an act; tvayi—unto You; viçva—universal; vismaye—full of wonders; yaù—one who; mäyayä—by potencies; idam—this; sasåje—created; ativismayam—surpassing all wonders.

Who else but You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could deliver the earth from within the water? It is not very wonderful for You, however, because You acted most wonderfully in the creation of the universe. By Your energy You have created this superwonderful cosmic manifestation.

PURPORT
When a scientist discovers something impressive to the ignorant mass of people, the common man, without inquiry, accepts such a discovery as wonderful. But the intelligent man is not struck with wonder by such discoveries. He gives all credit to the person who created the wonderful brain of the scientist. A common man is also struck with wonder by the wonderful action of material nature, and he gives all credit to the cosmic manifestation, without inquiring into the brain behind it. The learned Kåñëa conscious person, however, knows well that behind the cosmic manifestation is the brain of Kåñëa, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (9.10): mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram. Since Kåñëa can direct the wonderful cosmic manifestation, it is not at all wonderful for Him to assume the gigantic form of a boar and thus deliver the earth from the mire of the water. A devotee is therefore not astonished to see the wonderful boar because he knows that the Lord is able to act far more wonderfully by His potencies, which are inconceivable to the brain of even the most erudite scientist.

vidhunvatä vedamayaà nijaà vapur
janas-tapaù-satya-niväsino vayam

vidhunvatä—while shaking; veda-mayam—personified Vedas; nijam—own; vapuù—body; janaù—the Janaloka planetary system; tapaù—the Tapoloka planetary system; satya—the Satyaloka planetary system; niväsinaù—the inhabitants; vayam—we; saöä—hairs on the shoulder; çikha-uddhüta—sustained by the tip of the hair; çiva—auspicious; ambu—water; bindubhiù—by the particles; vimåjyamänäù—we are thus sprinkled by; bhåçam—highly; éça—O Supreme Lord; pävitäù—purified.

O Supreme Lord, undoubtedly we are inhabitants of the most pious planets—the Jana, Tapas and Satya lokas—but still we have been purified by the drops of water sprinkled from Your shoulder hairs by the shaking of Your body.

PURPORT
Ordinarily the body of a hog is considered impure, but one should not consider that the hog incarnation assumed by the Lord is also impure. That form of the Lord is the personified Vedas and is transcendental. The inhabitants of the Jana, Tapas and Satya lokas are the most pious persons in the material world, but because those planets are situated in the material world, there are so many material impurities there also. Therefore, when the drops of water from the tips of the Lord's shoulder hairs were sprinkled upon the bodies of the inhabitants of the higher planets, they felt purified. The Ganges water is pure because of its emanating from the toe of the Lord, and there is no difference between the water emanating from the toe and that from the tips of the hair on the shoulder of Lord Boar. They are both absolute and transcendental.
TEXT 45

saù—he; vai—certainly; bata—alas; bhrañöa-matiù—nonsensical; tava—Your; eñate—desires; yaù—one who; karmaëäm—of activities; päram—limit; apära-karmaëaù—of one who has unlimited activities; yat—by whom; yoga—mystic power; mäyä—potency; guëa—modes of material nature; yoga—mystic power; mohitam—bewildered; viçvam—the universe; samastam—in total; bhagavan—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; vidhehi—just be pleased to bestow; çam—good fortune.

O Lord, there is no limit to Your wonderful activities. Anyone who desires to know the limit of Your activities is certainly nonsensical. Everyone in this world is conditioned by Your powerful mystic potencies. Please bestow Your causeless mercy upon these conditioned souls.

PURPORT
Mental speculators who want to understand the limit of the Unlimited are certainly nonsensical. Every one of them is captivated by the external potencies of the Lord. The best thing for them is to surrender unto Him, knowing Him to be inconceivable, for thus they can receive His causeless mercy. This prayer was offered by the inhabitants of the higher planetary systems, namely the Jana, Tapas and Satya lokas, who are far more intelligent and powerful than humans.
The words viçvaà samastam are very significant here. There are the material world and the spiritual world. The sages pray: "Both worlds are bewildered by Your different energies. Those who are in the spiritual world are absorbed in Your loving service, forgetting themselves and You also, and those in the material world are absorbed in material sense gratification and therefore also forget You. No one can know You, because You are unlimited. It is best not to try to know You by unnecessary mental speculation. Rather, kindly bless us so that we can worship You with causeless devotional service."

kumäräù ücuù—the Kumäras said; yaù—He who; antarhitaù—not manifested; hådi—in the heart; gataù—is seated; api—even though; durätmanäm—to the rascals; tvam—You; saù—He; adya—today; eva—certainly; naù—of us; nayana-mülam—face to face; ananta—O unlimited one; räddhaù—attained; yarhi—when; eva—certainly; karëa-vivareëa—through the ears; guhäm—intelligence; gataù—have attained; naù—our; piträ—by our father; anuvarëita—described; rahäù—mysteries; bhavat-udbhavena—by Your appearance.

The Kumäras said: Our dear Lord, You are not manifested to rascals, even though You are seated within the heart of everyone. But as far as we are concerned, we see You face to face, although You are unlimited. The statements we have heard about You from our father, Brahmä, through the ears have now been actually realized by Your kind appearance.

PURPORT
The so-called yogés who concentrate their mind or meditate upon the impersonal or void are described here. This verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes persons who are expected to be very expert yogés engaged in meditation but who do not find the Supreme Personality of Godhead seated within the heart. These persons are described here as durätmä, which means a person who has a very crooked heart, or a less intelligent person, just opposite to a mahätmä, which means one who has a broad heart. Those so-called yogés who, although engaged in meditation, are not broad-hearted cannot find the four-handed Näräyaëa form, even though He is seated within their heart. Although the first realization of the Supreme Absolute Truth is impersonal Brahman, one should not remain satisfied with experiencing the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Lord. In the Éçopaniñad also, the devotee prays that the glaring effulgence of Brahman may be removed from his eyes so that he can see the real, personal feature of the Lord and thus satisfy himself fully. Similarly, although the Lord is not visible in the beginning because of His glaring bodily effulgence, if a devotee sincerely wants to see Him, the Lord is revealed to him. It is said in Bhagavad-gétä that the Lord cannot be seen by our imperfect eyes, He cannot be heard by our imperfect ears, and He cannot be experienced by our imperfect senses; but if one engages in devotional service with faith and devotion, then God reveals Himself.
Here the four sages Sanaka, Sanätana, Sanandana and Sanat-kumära, are described as actually sincere devotees. Although they had heard from their father, Brahmä, about the personal feature of the Lord, only the impersonal feature—Brahman—was revealed to them. But because they were sincerely searching for the Lord, they finally saw His personal feature directly, which corresponded with the description given by their father. They thus became fully satisfied. Here they express their gratitude because although they were foolish impersonalists in the beginning, by the grace of the Lord they could now have the good fortune to see His personal feature. Another significant aspect of this verse is that the sages describe their experience of hearing from their father, Brahmä, who was born of the Lord directly. In other words, the disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmä and from Brahmä to Närada and from Närada to Vyäsa, and so on, is accepted here. Because the Kumäras were sons of Brahmä, they had the opportunity to learn Vedic knowledge from the disciplic succession of Brahmä, and therefore, in spite of their impersonalist beginnings, they became, in the end, direct seers of the personal feature of the Lord.
TEXT 47
taà tväà vidäma bhagavan param ätma-tattvaà
sattvena samprati ratià racayantam eñäm
yat te 'nutäpa-viditair dåòha-bhakti-yogair
udgranthayo hådi vidur munayo virägäù


tam—Him; tväm—You; vidäma—we know; bhagavan—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; param—the Supreme; ätma-tattvam—Absolute Truth; sattvena—by Your form of pure goodness; samprati—now; ratim—love of God; racayantam—creating; eñäm—of all of them; yat—which; te—Your; anutäpa—mercy; viditaiù—understood; dåòha—unflinching; bhakti-yogaiù—through devotional service; udgranthayaù—without attachment, free from material bondage; hådi—in the heart; viduù—understood; munayaù—great sages; virägäù—not interested in material life.

We know that You are the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, who manifests His transcendental form in the uncontaminated mode of pure goodness. This transcendental, eternal form of Your personality can be understood only by Your mercy, through unflinching devotional service, by great sages whose hearts have been purified in the devotional way.

PURPORT
The Absolute Truth can be understood in three features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here it is admitted that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the last word in understanding the Absolute Truth. Even though the four Kumäras were instructed by their great learned father, Brahmä, they could not actually understand the Absolute Truth. They could only understand the Supreme Absolute Truth when they personally saw the Personality of Godhead with their own eyes. In other words, if one sees or understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the other two features of the Absolute Truth—namely impersonal Brahman and localized Paramätmä—are also automatically understood. Therefore the Kumäras confirm: "You are the ultimate Absolute Truth." The impersonalist may argue that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead was so nicely decorated, He was therefore not the Absolute Truth. But here it is confirmed that all the variegatedness of the absolute platform is constituted of çuddha-sattva, pure goodness. In the material world, any quality—goodness, passion or ignorance—is contaminated. Even the quality of goodness here in the material world is not free from tinges of passion and ignorance. But in the transcendental world, only pure goodness, without any tinge of passion or ignorance, exists; therefore the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His variegated pastimes and paraphernalia are all pure sattva-guëa. Such variegatedness in pure goodness is exhibited eternally by the Lord for the satisfaction of the devotee. The devotee does not want to see the Supreme Personality of Absolute Truth in voidness or impersonalism. In one sense, absolute transcendental variegatedness is meant only for the devotees, not for others, because this distinct feature of transcendental variegatedness can be understood only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord and not by mental speculation or the ascending process. It is said that one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead when one is even slightly favored by Him; otherwise, without His mercy, a man may speculate for thousands of years and not understand what is actually the Absolute Truth. This mercy can be perceived by the devotee when he is completely freed from contamination. It is stated, therefore, that only when all contamination is rooted out and the devotee is completely detached from material attractions can he receive this mercy of the Lord.
TEXT 48

na—not; ätyantikam—liberation; vigaëayanti—care for; api—even; te—those; prasädam—benedictions; kim u—what to speak; anyat—other material happinesses; arpita—given; bhayam—fearfulness; bhruvaù—of the eyebrows; unnayaiù—by the raising; te—Your; ye—those devotees; aìga—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; tvat—Your; aìghri—lotus feet; çaraëäù—who have taken shelter; bhavataù—Your; kathäyäù—narrations; kértanya—worth chanting; tértha—pure; yaçasaù—glories; kuçaläù—very expert; rasa-jïäù—knowers of the mellows or humors.

Persons who are very expert and most intelligent in understanding things as they are engage in hearing narrations of the auspicious activities and pastimes of the Lord, which are worth chanting and worth hearing. Such persons do not care even for the highest material benediction, namely liberation, to say nothing of other less important benedictions like the material happiness of the heavenly kingdom.

PURPORT
The transcendental bliss enjoyed by the devotees of the Lord is completely different from the material happiness enjoyed by less intelligent persons. The less intelligent persons in the material world are engaged by the four principles of benediction called dharma, artha, käma and mokña. Generally they prefer to take to religious life to achieve some material benediction, the purpose of which is to satisfy the senses. When, by that process, they become confused or frustrated in fulfilling the maximum amount of sense enjoyment, they try to become one with the Supreme, which is, according to their conception, mukti, or liberation. There are five kinds of liberation, the least important of which is called säyujya, to become one with the Supreme. Devotees don't care for such liberation because they are actually intelligent. Nor are they inclined to accept any of the other four kinds of liberation, namely to live on the same planet as the Lord, to live with Him side by side as an associate, to have the same opulence, and to attain the same bodily features. They are concerned only with glorifying the Supreme Lord and His auspicious activities. Pure devotional service is çravaëaà kértanam [SB 7.5.23]. Pure devotees, who take transcendental pleasure in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, do not care for any kind of liberation; even if they are offered the five liberations, they refuse to accept them, as stated in the Bhägavatam in the Third Canto. Materialistic persons aspire for the sense enjoyment of heavenly pleasure in the heavenly kingdom, but devotees reject such material pleasure at once. The devotee does not even care for the post of Indra. A devotee knows that any pleasurable material position is subject to be annihilated at a certain point. Even if one reaches the post of Indra, Candra, or any other demigod, he must be dissolved at a certain stage. A devotee is never interested in such temporary pleasure. From Vedic scriptures it is understood that sometimes even Brahmä and Indra fall down, but a devotee in the transcendental abode of the Lord never falls. This transcendental stage of life, in which one feels transcendental pleasure in hearing the Lord's pastimes, is also recommended by Lord Caitanya. When Lord Caitanya was talking with Rämänanda Räya, there were varieties of suggestions offered by Rämänanda regarding spiritual realization, but Lord Caitanya rejected all but one—that one should hear the glories of the Lord in association with pure devotees. That is acceptable for everyone, especially in this age. One should engage himself in hearing from pure devotees about the activities of the Lord. That is considered the supreme benediction for mankind.

kämam—as much as deserved; bhavaù—birth; sva-våjinaiù—by our own sinful activities; nirayeñu—in low births; naù—our; stät—let it be; cetaù—minds; ali-vat—like bees; yadi—if; nu—may be; te—Your; padayoù—at Your lotus feet; rameta—are engaged; väcaù—words; ca—and; naù—our; tulasi-vat—like the tulasé leaves; yadi—if; te—Your; aìghri—at Your lotus feet; çobhäù—beautified; püryeta—are filled; te—Your; guëa-gaëaiù—by transcendental qualities; yadi—if; karëa-randhraù—the holes of the ears.

O Lord, we pray that You let us be born in any hellish condition of life, just as long as our hearts and minds are always engaged in the service of Your lotus feet, our words are made beautiful [by speaking of Your activities] just as tulasé leaves are beautified when offered unto Your lotus feet, and as long as our ears are always filled with the chanting of Your transcendental qualities.

PURPORT
The four sages now offer their humility to the Personality of Godhead because of their having been haughty in cursing two other devotees of the Lord. Jaya and Vijaya, the two doorkeepers who checked them from entering the Vaikuëöha planet, were certainly offenders, but as Vaiñëavas, the four sages should not have cursed them in anger. After the incident, they became conscious that they had done wrong by cursing the devotees of the Lord, and they prayed to the Lord that even in the hellish condition of life their minds might not be distracted from the engagement of service to the lotus feet of Lord Näräyaëa. Those who are devotees of the Lord are not afraid of any condition of life, provided there is constant engagement in the service of the Lord. It is said of the näräyaëa-para, or those who are devotees of Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, na kutaçcana bibhyati (SB 6.17.28). They are not afraid of entering a hellish condition, for since they are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, heaven or hell is the same for them. In material life both heaven and hell are one and the same because they are material; in either place there is no engagement in the Lord's service. Therefore those who are engaged in the service of the Lord see no distinction between heaven and hell; it is only the materialists who prefer one to the other.
These four devotees prayed to the Lord that although they might go to hell because they had cursed devotees, they might not forget the service of the Lord. The transcendental loving service of the Lord is performed in three ways—with the body, with the mind and with words. Here the sages pray that their words may always be engaged in glorifying the Supreme Lord. One may speak very nicely with ornamental language or one may be expert at controlled grammatical presentation, but if one's words are not engaged in the service of the Lord, they have no flavor and no actual use. The example is given here of tulasé leaves. The tulasé leaf is very useful even from the medicinal or antiseptic point of view. It is considered sacred and is offered to the lotus feet of the Lord. The tulasé leaf has numerous good qualities, but if it were not offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, tulasé could not be of much value or importance. Similarly, one may speak very nicely from the rhetorical or grammatical point of view, which may be very much appreciated by a materialistic audience, but if one's words are not offered to the service of the Lord, they are useless. The holes of the ears are very small and can be filled with any insignificant sound, so how can they receive as great a vibration as the glorification of the Lord? The answer is that the holes of the ears are like the sky. As the sky can never be filled up, the quality of the ear is such that one may go on pouring in vibrations of various kinds, yet it is capable of receiving more and more vibrations. A devotee is not afraid of going to hell if he has the opportunity to hear the glories of the Lord constantly. This is the advantage of chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. One may be put in any condition, but God gives him the prerogative to chant Hare Kåñëa. In any condition of life, if one goes on chanting he will never be unhappy.

präduçcakartha—You have manifested; yat—which; idam—this; puruhüta—O greatly worshiped; rüpam—eternal form; tena—by that form; éça—O Lord; nirvåtim—satisfaction; aväpuù—obtained; alam—so much; dåçaù—vision; naù—our; tasmai—unto Him; idam—this; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; namaù—obeisances; it—only; vidhema—let us offer; yaù—who; anätmanäm—of those who are less intelligent; durudayaù—cannot be seen; bhagavän—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; pratétaù—has been seen by us.

O Lord, we therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Your eternal form as the Personality of Godhead, which You have so kindly manifested before us. Your supreme, eternal form cannot be seen by unfortunate, less intelligent persons, but we are so much satisfied in our mind and vision to see it.

PURPORT
The four sages were impersonalists in the beginning of their spiritual life, but afterwards, by the grace of their father and spiritual master, Brahmä, they understood the eternal, spiritual form of the Lord and felt completely satisfied. In other words, the transcendentalists who aspire to the impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä are not fully satisfied and still hanker for more. Even if they are satisfied in their minds, still, transcendentally, their eyes are not satisfied. But as soon as such persons come to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are satisfied in all respects. In other words, they become devotees and want to see the form of the Lord continually. It is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä that one who has developed transcendental love of Kåñëa by smearing his eyes with the ointment of love sees constantly the eternal form of the Lord. The particular word used in this connection, anätmanäm, signifies those who have no control over the mind and senses and who therefore speculate and want to become one with the Lord. Such persons cannot have the pleasure of seeing the eternal form of the Lord. For the impersonalists and the so-called yogés, the Lord is always hidden by the curtain of yogamäyä. Bhagavad-gétä says that even when Lord Kåñëa was seen by everyone while He was present on the surface of the earth, the impersonalists and the so-called yogés could not see Him because they were devoid of devotional eyesight. The theory of the impersonalists and so-called yogés is that the Supreme Lord assumes a particular form when He comes in touch with mäyä, although actually He has no form. This very conception of the impersonalists and so-called yogés checks them from seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. The Lord, therefore, is always beyond the sight of such nondevotees. The four sages felt so much obliged to the Lord that they offered their respectful obeisances unto Him again and again.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Description of the kingdom of God."

The sages said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we are unable to know what You intend for us to do, for even though You are the supreme ruler of all, You speak in our favor as if we had done something good for You.

PURPORT
The sages could understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is above everyone, was speaking as if He were in the wrong; therefore it was difficult for them to understand the words of the Lord. They could understand, however, that the Lord was speaking in such a humble way just to show them His all-merciful favor.

O Lord, You are the supreme director of the brahminical culture. Your considering the brähmaëas to be in the highest position is Your example for teaching others. Actually You are the supreme worshipable Deity, not only for the gods but for the brähmaëas also.

PURPORT
In the Brahma-saàhitä it is clearly stated that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes. There are undoubtedly many demigods, the chiefs of whom are Brahmä and Çiva. Lord Viñëu is the Lord of Brahmä and Çiva, not to speak of the brähmaëas in this material world. As mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä, the Supreme Lord is very favorable towards all activities performed according to brahminical culture, or the qualities of control of the senses and mind, cleanliness, forbearance, faith in scripture, and practical and theoretical knowledge. The Lord is the Supersoul of everyone. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the Lord is the source of all emanations; thus He is also the source of Brahmä and Çiva.
TEXT 18
tvattaù sanätano dharmo
rakñyate tanubhis tava
dharmasya paramo guhyo
nirvikäro bhavän mataù


tvattaù—from You; sanätanaù—eternal; dharmaù—occupation; rakñyate—is protected; tanubhiù—by multimanifestations; tava—Your; dharmasya—of religious principles; paramaù—the supreme; guhyaù—objective; nirvikäraù—unchangeable; bhavän—You; mataù—in our opinion.

You are the source of the eternal occupation of all living entities, and by Your multimanifestations of Personalities of Godhead, You have always protected religion. You are the supreme objective of religious principles, and in our opinion You are inexhaustible and unchangeable eternally.

PURPORT
The statement in this verse dharmasya paramo guhyaù refers to the most confidential part of all religious principles. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. The conclusion of Lord Kåñëa in His advice to Arjuna is: "Give up all other religious engagement and just surrender unto Me." This is the most confidential knowledge in executing religious principles. In the Bhägavatam also it is stated that if one does not become Kåñëa conscious after very rigidly executing one's specified religious duties, all his labor in following so-called religious principles is simply a waste of time. Here also the sages confirm the statement that the Supreme Lord, not the demigods, is the ultimate goal of all religious principles. There are many foolish propagandists who say that worship of the demigods is also a way to reach the supreme goal, but in the authorized statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä this is not accepted. Bhagavad-gétä says that one who worships a particular demigod can reach the demigod's planet, but one who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead can enter into Vaikuëöha. Some propagandists say that regardless of what one does he will ultimately reach the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, but this is not valid. The Lord is eternal, the Lord's servitor is eternal, and the Lord's abode is also eternal. They are all described here as sanätana, or eternal. The result of devotional service, therefore, is not temporary, as is the achievement of heavenly planets by worshiping the demigods. The sages wanted to stress that although the Lord, out of His causeless mercy, says that He worships the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, actually the Lord is worshipable not only by the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas but also by the demigods.
TEXT 19
taranti hy aïjasä måtyuà
nivåttä yad-anugrahät

anugåhyeta yat paraiù


taranti—cross over; hi—because; aïjasä—easily; måtyum—birth and death; nivåttäù—ceasing all material desires; yat—Your; anugrahät—by mercy; yoginaù—transcendentalists; saù—the Supreme Lord; bhavän—You; kim svit—never possible; anugåhyeta—may be favored; yat—which; paraiù—by others.

Mystics and transcendentalists, by the mercy of the Lord, cross beyond nescience by ceasing all material desires. It is not possible, therefore, that the Supreme Lord can be favored by others.

PURPORT
Unless one is favored by the Supreme Lord, one cannot cross over the ocean of the nescience of repeated birth and death. Here it is stated that yogés or mystics cross beyond nescience by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many kinds of mystics, such as the karma-yogé, jïäna-yogé, dhyäna-yogé and bhakti-yogé. The karmés particularly search after the favor of the demigods, the jïänés want to become one with the Supreme Absolute Truth, and the yogés are satisfied simply by partial vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, and ultimately by oneness with Him. But the bhaktas, the devotees, want to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally and serve Him. It has already been admitted that the Lord is eternal, and those who want the favor of the Supreme Lord perpetually are also eternal. Therefore yogés here means devotees. By the mercy of the Lord, devotees can easily pass beyond the nescience of birth and death and attain the eternal abode of the Lord. The Lord is therefore not in need of another's favor because no one is equal to or greater than Him. Actually, everyone needs the favor of the Lord for successful understanding of his human mission.

yam—whom; vai—certainly; vibhütiù—Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune; upayäti—waits upon; anuvelam—occasionally; anyaiù—by others; artha—material facility; arthibhiù—by those who desire; sva-çirasä—on their own heads; dhåta—accepting; päda—of the feet; reëuù—the dust; dhanya—by the devotees; arpita—offered; aìghri—at Your feet; tulasé—of tulasé leaves; nava—fresh; däma—on the garland; dhämnaù—having a place; lokam—the place; madhu-vrata-pateù—of the king of the bees; iva—like; käma-yänä—is anxious to secure.

The goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, the dust of whose feet is worn on the head by others, waits upon You, as appointed, for she is anxious to secure a place in the abode of the king of bees, who hovers on the fresh wreath of tulasé leaves offered at Your feet by some blessed devotee.

PURPORT
As previously described, tulasé has attained all superior qualities due to being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord. The comparison made here is very nice. As the king of bees hovers over the tulasé leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, so Lakñmé, the goddess who is sought by the demigods, brähmaëas, Vaiñëavas and everyone else, always engages in rendering service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The conclusion is that no one can be the benefactor of the Lord; everyone is actually the servant of the servant of the Lord [Cc. Madhya 13.80].
TEXT 21
yas täà vivikta-caritair anuvartamänäà

yaù—who; täm—Lakñmé; vivikta—completely pure; caritaiù—devotional services; anuvartamänäm—serving; na—not; atyädriyat—attached; parama—the highest; bhägavata—devotees; prasaìgaù—attached; saù—the Supreme Lord; tvam—You; dvija—of the brähmaëas; anupatha—on the path; puëya—sanctified; rajaù—dust; punétaù—purified; çrévatsa—of Çrévatsa; lakñma—the mark; kim—what; agäù—You obtained; bhaga—all opulences or all good qualities; bhäjanaù—the reservoir; tvam—You.

O Lord, You are exceedingly attached to the activities of Your pure devotees, yet You are never attached to the goddesses of fortune who constantly engage in Your transcendental loving service. How can You be purified, therefore, by the dust of the path traversed by the brähmaëas, and how can You be glorified or made fortunate by the marks of Çrévatsa on Your chest?

PURPORT
It is said in the Brahma-saàhitä that the Lord is always served by many hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune in His Vaikuëöha planet, yet because of His attitude of renunciation of all opulences, He is not attached to any one of them. The Lord has six opulences—unlimited wealth, unlimited fame, unlimited strength, unlimited beauty, unlimited knowledge and unlimited renunciation. All the demigods and other living entities worship Lakñmé, the goddess of fortune, just to get her favor, yet the Lord is never attached to her because He can create an unlimited number of such goddesses for His transcendental service. The goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, is sometimes envious of the tulasé leaves which are placed at the lotus feet of the Lord, for they remain fixed there and do not move, whereas Lakñméjé, although stationed by the chest of the Lord, sometimes has to please other devotees who pray for her favor. Lakñméjé sometimes has to go to satisfy her numerous devotees, but tulasé leaves never forsake their position, and the Lord therefore appreciates the service of the tulasé more than the service of Lakñmé. When the Lord says, therefore, that it is due to the causeless mercy of the brähmaëas that Lakñméjé does not leave Him, we can understand that Lakñméjé is attracted by the opulence of the Lord, not by the brähmaëas' benedictions upon Him. The Lord is not dependent on anyone's mercy for His opulence; He is always self-sufficient. The Lord's statement that His opulence is due to the benediction of the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas is only to teach others that they should offer respect to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas, the devotees of the Lord.
TEXT 22

dharmasya—of the personification of all religion; te—of You; bhagavataù—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tri-yuga—You who are manifest in all three millenniums; tribhiù—by three; svaiù—Your own; padbhiù—feet; cara-acaram—animate and inanimate; idam—this universe; dvija—the twice-born; devatä—the demigods; artham—for the sake of; nünam—however; bhåtam—protected; tat—those feet; abhighäti—destroying; rajaù—the mode of passion; tamaù—the mode of ignorance; ca—and; sattvena—of pure goodness; naù—unto us; vara-dayä—bestowing all blessings; tanuvä—by Your transcendental form; nirasya—driving away.

O Lord, You are the personification of all religion. Therefore You manifest Yourself in three millenniums, and thus You protect this universe, which consists of animate and inanimate beings. By Your grace, which is of pure goodness and is the bestower of all blessings, kindly drive away the elements of rajas and tamas for the sake of the demigods and the twice-born.

PURPORT
The Lord is addressed in this verse as tri-yuga, or one who appears in three millenniums—namely the Satya, Dväpara and Tretä yugas. He is not mentioned as appearing in the fourth millennium, or Kali-yuga. It is described in Vedic literature that in Kali-yuga He comes as channa-avatära, or an incarnation, but He does not appear as a manifest incarnation. In the other yugas, however, the Lord is a manifest incarnation, and therefore he is addressed as tri-yuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas.
Çrédhara Svämé describes tri-yuga as follows: yuga means "couple," and tri means "three." The Lord is manifested as three couples by His six opulences, or three couples of opulences. In that way He can be addressed as tri-yuga. The Lord is the personality of religious principles. In three millenniums religious principles are protected by three kinds of spiritual culture, namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy. The Lord is called tri-yuga in that way also. In the Age of Kali these three requisites to spiritual culture are almost absent, but the Lord is so kind that in spite of Kali-yuga's being devoid of these three spiritual qualities, He comes and protects the people of this age in His covered incarnation as Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya is called "covered" because although He is Kåñëa Himself, He presents Himself as a devotee of Kåñëa, not directly Kåñëa. The devotees pray to Lord Caitanya, therefore, to eliminate their stock of passion and ignorance, the most conspicuous assets of this yuga. In the Kåñëa consciousness movement one cleanses himself of the modes of passion and ignorance by chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, as introduced by Lord Caitanya.
The four Kumäras were cognizant of their situation in the modes of passion and ignorance because, although in Vaikuëöha, they wanted to curse devotees of the Lord. Since they were conscious of their own weakness, they prayed to the Lord to remove their still-existing passion and ignorance. The three transcendental qualifications—cleanliness, austerity and mercy—are the qualifications of the twice-born and the demigods. Those who are not situated in the quality of goodness cannot accept these three principles of spiritual culture. For the Kåñëa consciousness movement, therefore, there are three sinful activities which are prohibited—namely illicit sex, intoxication, and eating food other than the prasäda offered to Kåñëa. These three prohibitions are based on the principles of austerity, cleanliness and mercy. Devotees are merciful because they spare the poor animals, and they are clean because they are free of contamination from unwanted foodstuff and unwanted habits. Austerity is represented by restricted sex life. These principles, indicated by the prayers of the four Kumäras, should be followed by the devotees who are engaged in Kåñëa consciousness.
TEXT 23

goptä våñaù svarhaëena sa-sünåtena

na—not; tvam—You; dvija—of the twice-born; uttama-kulam—the highest class; yadi—if; ha—indeed; ätma-gopam—worthy to be protected by You; goptä—the protector; våñaù—the best; su-arhaëena—by worship; sa-sünåtena—along with mild words; tarhi—then; eva—certainly; naìkñyati—will be lost; çivaù—auspicious; tava—Your; deva—O Lord; panthäù—the path; lokaù—the people in general; agrahéñyat—would accept; åñabhasya—of the best; hi—because; tat—that; pramäëam—authority.

O Lord, You are the protector of the highest of the twice-born. If You do not protect them by offering worship and mild words, then certainly the auspicious path of worship will be rejected by people in general, who act on the strength and authority of Your Lordship.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated by the Lord Himself that the acts and character of great authorities are followed by people in general. Leaders of ideal character are therefore needed in society. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in this material world just to show the example of perfect authority, and people have to follow His path. The Vedic injunction is that one cannot understand the Absolute Truth simply by mental speculation or logical argument. One has to follow the authorities. Mahäjano yena gataù sa panthäù [Cc. Madhya 17.186]. Great authorities should be followed; otherwise, if we simply depend on the scriptures, we are sometimes misled by rascals, or else we cannot understand or follow the different spiritual injunctions. The best path is to follow the authorities. The four brähmaëa-sages stated that Kåñëa is naturally the protector of the cows and brähmaëas: go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. When Kåñëa was on this planet, He set a practical example. He was a cowherd boy, and He was very respectful to the brähmaëas and devotees.
It is also affirmed herein that the brähmaëas are the best of the twice-born. Brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas are all twice-born, but the brähmaëas are the best. When there is a fight between two persons, each of them protects the upper part of his body—the head, the arms and the belly. Similarly, for the actual advancement of human civilization, the best part of the social body, namely the brähmaëas, the kñatriyas and vaiçyas (the intelligent class of men, the military class and the mercantile men) should be given special protection. Protection of the laborers should not be neglected, but special protection should be given to the upper orders. Of all classes of men, the brähmaëas and the Vaiñëavas should be given special protection. They should be worshiped. When their protection is performed, it is just like worshiping God. That is not exactly protection; it is a duty. One should worship the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas by offering them all kinds of endowments and sweet words, and if one has no means to offer anything, he must at least use sweet words to pacify them. The Lord personally exhibited this behavior towards the Kumäras.
If this system is not introduced by the leaders, then human civilization will be lost. When there is no protection and special treatment for persons who are devotees of the Lord, who are highly intelligent in spiritual life, then the whole society is lost. The word naìkñyati indicates that such a civilization becomes spoiled and is annihilated. The kind of civilization recommended is called deva-patha, which means the "royal road of the demigods." Demigods are supposed to be fully fixed in devotional service, or Kåñëa consciousness; that is the auspicious path that should be protected. If the authorities or the leaders of society do not give special respect to the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas and do not offer them not only sweet words but all facilities, then the path of progress will be lost to human civilization. The Lord personally wanted to teach this, and therefore He offered so much praise to the Kumäras.
TEXT 24

kñemaà janäya nija-çaktibhir uddhåtäreù

tat—that destruction of the path of auspiciousness; te—by You; anabhéñöam—is not liked; iva—as; sattva-nidheù—the reservoir of all goodness; vidhitsoù—desiring to do; kñemam—good; janäya—for the people in general; nija-çaktibhiù—by Your own potencies; uddhåta—destroyed; areù—the opposite element; na—not; etävatä—by this; tri-adhipateù—of the proprietor of the three kinds of creations; bata—O Lord; viçva-bhartuù—the maintainer of the universe; tejaù—potency; kñatam—reduced; tu—but; avanatasya—submissive; saù—that; te—Your; vinodaù—pleasure.

Dear Lord, You never want the auspicious path to be destroyed, for You are the reservoir of all goodness. Just to benefit people in general, You destroy the evil element by Your mighty potency. You are the proprietor of the three creations and the maintainer of the entire universe. Therefore Your potency is not reduced by Your submissive behavior. Rather, by submission You exhibit Your transcendental pastimes.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa was never reduced in His position by becoming a cowherd boy or by offering respect to Sudämä Brähmaëa or His other devotees like Nanda Mahäräja, Vasudeva, Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and the Päëòavas' mother, Kunté. Everyone knew that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, yet His behavior was exemplary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]; His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss and knowledge, and it is eternal. Because the living entities are His parts and parcels, originally they also belong to the same quality of eternal form as the Lord, but when they come in contact with mäyä, the material potency, due to their forgetfulness their existential constitution is covered. We should try to understand the appearance of Lord Kåñëa in this spirit, as the Kumäras pray to Him. He is eternally a cowherd boy at Våndävana, He is eternally the leader of the Battle of Kurukñetra, and He is eternally the opulent prince of Dvärakä and the lover of the damsels of Våndävana; all His appearances are meaningful because they show His real characteristics to the conditioned souls, who have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord. He does everything for their benefit. The force exhibited in the Battle of Kurukñetra by the desire of Kåñëa and through the agency of Arjuna was also necessary because when people become too irreligious, force is required. Nonviolence in this respect is rascaldom.

yam—which; vä—or; anayoù—of both of them; damam—punishment; adhéça—O Lord; bhavän—Your Lordship; vidhatte—awards; våttim—better existence; nu—certainly; vä—or; tat—that; anumanmahi—we accept; nirvyalékam—without duplicity; asmäsu—to us; vä—or; yaù—whichever; ucitaù—is proper; dhriyatäm—may be awarded; saù—that; daëòaù—punishment; ye—who; anägasau—sinless; vayam—we; ayuìkñmahi—allotted; kilbiñeëa—with a curse.

O Lord, whatever punishment You wish to award to these two innocent persons or also to us we shall accept without duplicity. We understand that we have cursed two faultless persons.

PURPORT
The sages, the four Kumäras, now reject their cursing of the two doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, because they are now conscious that persons who engage in the service of the Lord cannot be at fault at any stage. It is said that anyone who has implicit faith in the service of the Lord, or who actually engages in transcendental loving service, has all the good qualities of the demigods. Therefore, a devotee cannot be at fault. If sometimes it is found that he is in error by accident or by some temporary arrangement, that should not be taken very seriously. The cursing of Jaya and Vijaya is here repented. Now the Kumäras are thinking in terms of their position in the modes of passion and ignorance, and they are prepared to accept any kind of punishment from the Lord. In general, when dealing with devotees, we should not try to find faults. In Bhagavad-gétä also it is confirmed that the devotee who faithfully serves the Supreme Lord, even if found to commit a gross mistake, should be considered a sädhu, or saintly person. Due to former habits he may commit some wrong, but because he is engaged in the service of the Lord, that wrong should not be taken very seriously.

TEXT 30

deväù—the demigods; ücuù—said; namaù—obeisances; namaù—obeisances; te—unto You; akhila-yajïa-tantave—the enjoyer of all sacrifices; sthitau—for the purpose of maintaining; gåhéta—assumed; amala—pure; sattva—goodness; mürtaye—form; diñöyä—fortunately; hataù—slain; ayam—this; jagatäm—to the worlds; aruntudaù—causing torment; tvat-päda—to Your feet; bhaktyä—with devotion; vayam—we; éça—O Lord; nirvåtäù—have attained happiness.


The demigods addressed the Lord: All obeisances unto You! You are the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and You have assumed the form of a boar, in pure goodness, for the purpose of maintaining the world. Fortunately for us, this demon, who was a torment to the worlds, has been slain by You, and we too, O Lord, are now at ease, in devotion to Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
The material world consists of three modes—goodness, passion and ignorance—but the spiritual world is pure goodness. It is said here that the form of the Lord is pure goodness, which means that it is not material. In the material world there is no pure goodness. In the Bhägavatam the stage of pure goodness is called sattvaà viçuddham. Viçuddham means "pure." In pure goodness there is no contamination by the two inferior qualities, namely passion and ignorance. The form of the boar, therefore, in which the Lord appeared, is nothing of the material world. There are many other forms of the Lord, but none of them belong to the material qualities. Such forms are nondifferent from the Viñëu form, and Viñëu is the enjoyer of all sacrifices.
The sacrifices which are recommended in the Vedas are meant to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In ignorance only, people try to satisfy many other agents, but the real purpose of life is to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. All sacrifices are meant to please the Supreme Lord. The living entities who know this perfectly well are called demigods, godly or almost God. Since the living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, it is his duty to serve the Lord and please Him. The demigods are all attached to the Personality of Godhead, and for their pleasure the demon, who was a source of trouble to the world, was killed. Purified life is meant to please the Lord, and all sacrifices performed in purified life are called Kåñëa consciousness. This Kåñëa consciousness is developed by devotional service, as clearly mentioned here.

Song-7 Prayers by Kardama muni to Lord Vishnu (SB 3.21.13-21)
TEXT 13
åñir uväca

åñiù uväca—the great sage said; juñöam—is attained; bata—ah; adya—now; akhila—all; sattva—of goodness; räçeù—who are the reservoir; säàsiddhyam—the complete success; akñëoù—of the two eyes; tava—of You; darçanät—from the sight; naù—by us; yat—of whom; darçanam—sight; janmabhiù—through births; éòya—O worshipable Lord; sadbhiù—gradually elevated in position; äçäsate—aspire; yoginaù—yogés; rüòha-yogäù—having obtained perfection in yoga.

The great sage Kardama said: O supreme worshipable Lord, my power of sight is now fulfilled, having attained the greatest perfection of the sight of You, who are the reservoir of all existences. Through many successive births of deep meditation, advanced yogés aspire to see Your transcendental form.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here as the reservoir of all goodness and all pleasure. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, there is no real pleasure. When, therefore, one's body, mind and activities are situated in the service of the Lord, one is on the highest perfectional stage of goodness. Kardama Muni says, "Your Lordship is the reservoir of all that can be understood by the nomenclature of goodness, and by experiencing You face to face, eye to eye, the perfection of sight has now been attained." These statements are the pure devotional situation; for a devotee, the perfection of the senses is to engage in the service of the Lord. The sense of sight, when engaged in seeing the beauty of the Lord, is perfected; the power to hear, when engaged in hearing the glories of the Lord, is perfected; the power to taste, when one enjoys by eating prasäda, is perfected. When all the senses engage in relationship with the Personality of Godhead, one's perfection is technically called bhakti-yoga, which entails detaching the senses from material indulgence and attaching them to the service of the Lord. When one is freed from all designated conditional life and fully engages in the service of the Lord, one's service is called bhakti-yoga. Kardama Muni admits that seeing the Lord personally in bhakti-yoga is the perfection of sight. The exalted perfection of seeing the Lord is not exaggerated by Kardama Muni. He gives evidence that those who are actually elevated in yoga aspire in life after life to see this form of the Personality of Godhead. He was not a fictitious yogé. Those who are actually on the advanced path aspire only to see the eternal form of the Lord.

ye—those persons; mäyayä—by the deluding energy; te—of You; hata—has been lost; medhasaù—whose intelligence; tvat—Your; päda-aravindam—lotus feet; bhava—of mundane existence; sindhu—the ocean; potam—the boat for crossing; upäsate—worship; käma-laväya—for obtaining trivial pleasures; teñäm—their; räsi—You bestow; éça—O Lord; kämän—desires; niraye—in hell; api—even; ye—which desires; syuù—can be available.

Your lotus feet are the true vessel to take one across the ocean of mundane nescience. Only persons deprived of their intelligence by the spell of the deluding energy will worship those feet with a view to attain the trivial and momentary pleasures of the senses, which even persons rotting in hell can attain. However, O my Lord, You are so kind that You bestow mercy even upon them.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, Seventh Chapter, there are two kinds of devotees—those who desire material pleasures and those who desire nothing but service to the Lord. Material pleasures can be attained even by hogs and dogs, whose condition of life is hellish. The hog also eats, sleeps and enjoys sex life to the full extent, and it is also very satisfied with such hellish enjoyment of material existence. Modern yogés advise that because one has senses, one must enjoy to the fullest extent like cats and dogs, yet one can go on and practice yoga. This is condemned here by Kardama Muni; he says that such material pleasures are available for cats and dogs in a hellish condition. The Lord is so kind that if so-called yogés are satisfied by hellish pleasures, He can give them facilities to attain all the material pleasures they desire, but they cannot attain the perfectional stage attained by Kardama Muni.
Hellish and demoniac persons do not actually know what is the ultimate attainment in perfection, and therefore they think that sense gratification is the highest goal of life. They advise that one can satisfy the senses and at the same time, by reciting some mantra and by some practice, can cheaply aspire for perfection. Such persons are described here as hata-medhasaù, which means "those whose brains are spoiled." They aspire for material enjoyment by perfection of yoga or meditation. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated by the Lord that the intelligence of those who worship the demigods has been spoiled. Similarly, here too it is stated by Kardama Muni that one who aspires after material enjoyment by practice of yoga has spoiled his brain substance and is fool number one. Actually, the intelligent practitioner of yoga should aspire for nothing else but to cross over the ocean of nescience by worshiping the Personality of Godhead and to see the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind, however, that even today persons whose brain substance is spoiled are given the benediction to become cats, dogs or hogs and enjoy material happiness from sex life and sense gratification. The Lord confirms this benediction in Bhagavad-gétä: "Whatever a person aspires to receive from Me, I offer him as he desires."

tathä—similarly; saù—myself; ca—also; aham—I; parivoòhu-kämaù—desiring to marry; samäna-çéläm—a girl of like disposition; gåha-medha—in married life; dhenum—a cow of plenty; upeyivän—have approached; mülam—the root (lotus feet); açeña—of everything; mülam—the source; duräçayaù—with lustful desire; käma-dugha—yielding all desires; aìghripasya—(of You) who are the tree.

Therefore, desiring to marry a girl of like disposition who may prove to be a veritable cow of plenty in my married life, to satisfy my lustful desire I too have sought the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the source of everything, for You are like a desire tree.

PURPORT
In spite of his condemning persons who approach the Lord for material advantages, Kardama Muni expressed his material inability and desire before the Lord by saying, "Although I know that nothing material should be asked from You, I nevertheless desire to marry a girl of like disposition." The phrase "like disposition" is very significant. Formerly, boys and girls of similar dispositions were married; the similar natures of the boy and girl were united in order to make them happy. Not more than twenty-five years ago, and perhaps it is still current, parents in India used to consult the horoscope of the boy and girl to see whether there would be factual union in their psychological conditions. These considerations are very important. Nowadays marriage takes place without such consultation, and therefore, soon after the marriage, there is divorce and separation. Formerly husband and wife used to live together peacefully throughout their whole lives, but nowadays it is a very difficult task.
Kardama Muni wanted to have a wife of like disposition because a wife is necessary to assist in spiritual and material advancement. It is said that a wife yields the fulfillment of all desires in religion, economic development and sense gratification. If one has a nice wife, he is to be considered a most fortunate man. In astrology, a man is considered fortunate who has great wealth, very good sons or a very good wife. Of these three, one who has a very good wife is considered the most fortunate. Before marrying, one should select a wife of like disposition and not be enamored with so-called beauty or other attractive features for sense gratification. In the Bhägavatam, Twelfth Canto, it is said that in the Kali-yuga marriage will be based on the consideration of sex life; as soon as there is deficiency in sex life, the question of divorce will arise.
Kardama Muni could have asked his benediction from Umä, for it is recommended in the scriptures that if anyone wants a good wife, he should worship Umä. But he preferred to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead because it is recommended in the Bhägavatam that everyone, whether he is full of desires, has no desire or desires liberation, should worship the Supreme Lord. Of these three classes of men, one tries to be happy by fulfillment of material desires, another wants to be happy by becoming one with the Supreme, and another, the perfect man, is a devotee. He does not want anything in return from the Personality of Godhead; he only wants to render transcendental loving service. In any case, everyone should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He will fulfill everyone's desire. The advantage of worshiping the Supreme Person is that even if one has desires for material enjoyment, if he worships Kåñëa he will gradually become a pure devotee and have no more material hankering.

prajäpates te vacasädhéça tantyä
lokaù kiläyaà käma-hato 'nubaddhaù

prajäpateù—who are the master of all living entities; te—of You; vacasä—under the direction; adhéça—O my Lord; tantyä—by a rope; lokaù—conditioned souls; kila—indeed; ayam—these; käma-hataù—conquered by lusty desires; anubaddhaù—are bound; aham—I; ca—and; loka-anugataù—following the conditioned souls; vahämi—offer; balim—oblations; ca—and; çukla—O embodiment of religion; animiñäya—existing as eternal time; tubhyam—to You.

O my Lord, You are the master and leader of all living entities. Under Your direction, all conditioned souls, as if bound by rope, are constantly engaged in satisfying their desires. Following them, O embodiment of religion, I also bear oblations for You, who are eternal time.

PURPORT
In the Kaöha Upaniñad it is stated that the Supreme Lord is the leader of all living entities. He is their sustainer and the awarder of all their necessities and desires. No living entity is independent; all are dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Vedic instruction is that one should enjoy life under the direction of the supreme leader, the Personality of Godhead. Vedic literatures like Éçopaniñad direct that since everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not encroach upon another's property, but should enjoy one's individual allotment. The best program for every living entity is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and enjoy material or spiritual life.
A question may be raised: Since Kardama Muni was advanced in spiritual life, why then did he not ask the Lord for liberation? Why did he want to enjoy material life in spite of his personally seeing and experiencing the Supreme Lord? The answer is that not everyone is competent to be liberated from material bondage. It is everyone's duty, therefore, to enjoy according to his present position, but under the direction of the Lord or the Vedas. The Vedas are considered to be the direct words of the Lord. The Lord gives us the opportunity to enjoy material life as we want, and at the same time He gives directions for the modes and processes of abiding by the Vedas so that gradually one may be elevated to liberation from material bondage. The conditioned souls who have come to the material world to fulfill their desires to lord it over material nature are bound by the laws of nature. The best course is to abide by the Vedic rules; that will help one to be gradually elevated to liberation.
Kardama Muni addresses the Lord as çukla, which means "the leader of religion." One who is pious should follow the rules of religion, for such rules are prescribed by the Lord Himself. No one can manufacture or concoct a religion; "religion" refers to the injunctions or laws of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that religion means to surrender unto Him. Therefore one should follow the Vedic regulations and surrender unto the Supreme Lord because that is the ultimate goal of perfection in human life. One should live a life of piety, follow the religious rules and regulations, marry and live peacefully for elevation to the higher status of spiritual realization.

lokän—worldly affairs; ca—and; loka-anugatän—the followers of worldly affairs; paçün—beastly; ca—and; hitvä—having given up; çritäù—taken shelter; te—Your; caraëa—of lotus feet; ätapatram—the umbrella; parasparam—with one another; tvat—Your; guëa—of qualities; väda—by discussion; sédhu—intoxicating; péyüña—by the nectar; niryäpita—extinguished; deha-dharmäù—the primary necessities of the body.

However, persons who have given up stereotyped worldly affairs and the beastly followers of these affairs, and who have taken shelter of the umbrella of Your lotus feet by drinking the intoxicating nectar of Your qualities and activities in discussions with one another, can be freed from the primary necessities of the material body.

PURPORT
After describing the necessity of married life, Kardama Muni asserts that marriage and other social affairs are stereotyped regulations for persons who are addicted to material sense enjoyment. The principles of animal life—eating, sleeping, mating and defending—are actually necessities of the body, but those who engage in transcendental Kåñëa consciousness, giving up all the stereotyped activities of this material world, are freed from social conventions. Conditioned souls are under the spell of material energy, or eternal time—past, present and future—but as soon as one engages in Kåñëa consciousness, he transcends the limits of past and present and becomes situated in the eternal activities of the soul. One has to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions in order to enjoy material life, but those who have taken to the devotional service of the Lord are not afraid of the regulations of this material world. Such devotees do not care for the conventions of material activities; they boldly take to that shelter which is like an umbrella against the sun of repeated birth and death.
Constant transmigration of the soul from one body to another is the cause of suffering in material existence. This conditional life in material existence is called saàsära. One may perform good work and take his birth in a very nice material condition, but the process under which birth and death take place is like a terrible fire. Çré Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, in his prayer to the spiritual master, has described this. Saàsära, or the repetition of birth and death, is compared to a forest fire. A forest fire takes place automatically, without anyone's endeavor, by the friction of dried wood, and no fire department or sympathetic person can extinguish it. The raging forest fire can be extinguished only when there is a constant downpour of water from a cloud. The cloud is compared to the mercy of the spiritual master. By the grace of the spiritual master the cloud of the mercy of the Personality of Godhead is brought in, and then only, when the rains of Kåñëa consciousness fall, can the fire of material existence be extinguished. This is also explained here. In order to find freedom from the stereotyped conditional life of material existence, one has to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, not in the manner in which the impersonalists indulge, but in devotional service, chanting and hearing of the activities of the Lord. Only then can one be freed from the actions and reactions of material existence. It is recommended here that one should give up the conditional life of this material world and the association of so-called civilized human beings who are simply following, in a polished way, the same stereotyped principles of eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Chanting and hearing of the glories of the Lord is described here as tvad-guëa-väda-sédhu. Only by drinking the nectar of chanting and hearing the pastimes of the Lord can one forget the intoxication of material existence.

na—not; te—Your; ajara—of imperishable Brahman; akña—on the axle; bhramiù—rotating; äyuù—span of life; eñäm—of the devotees; trayodaça—thirteen; aram—spokes; tri-çatam—three hundred; ñañöi—sixty; parva—functions; ñaö—six; nemi—rims; ananta—innumerable; chadi—leaves; yat—which; tri—three; näbhi—naves; karäla-srotaù—with tremendous velocity; jagat—the universe; äcchidya—cutting short; dhävat—running.

Your wheel, which has three naves, rotates around the axis of the imperishable Brahman. It has thirteen spokes, 360 joints, six rims and numberless leaves carved upon it. Though its revolution cuts short the life-span of the entire creation, this wheel of tremendous velocity cannot touch the life-span of the devotees of the Lord.

PURPORT
The time factor cannot affect the span of life of the devotees. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated that a little execution of devotional service saves one from the greatest danger. The greatest danger is transmigration of the soul from one body to another, and only devotional service to the Lord can stop this process. It is stated in the Vedic literatures, harià vinä na måtim taranti: without the mercy of the Lord, one cannot stop the cycle of birth and death. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated that only by understanding the transcendental nature of the Lord and His activities, His appearance and disappearance, can one stop the cycle of death and go back to Him. The time factor is divided into many fractions of moments, hours, months, years, periods, seasons, etc. All the divisions in this verse are determined according to the astronomical calculations of Vedic literature. There are six seasons, called åtus, and there is the period of four months called cäturmäsya. Three periods of four months complete one year. According to Vedic astronomical calculations, there are thirteen months. The thirteenth month is called adhi-mäsa or mala-mäsa and is added every third year. The time factor, however, cannot touch the lifespan of the devotees. In another verse it is stated that when the sun rises and sets it takes away the life of all living entities, but it cannot take away the life of those who are engaged in devotional service. Time is compared here to a big wheel which has 360 joints, six rims in the shape of seasons, and numberless leaves in the shape of moments. It rotates on the eternal existence, Brahman.

ekaù—one; svayam—Yourself; san—being; jagataù—the universes; sisåkñayä—with a desire to create; advitéyayä—without a second; ätman—in Yourself; adhi—controlling; yoga-mäyayä—by yogamäyä; såjasi—You create; adaù—those universes; päsi—You maintain; punaù—again; grasiñyase—You will wind up; yathä—like; ürëa-näbhiù—a spider; bhagavan—O Lord; sva-çaktibhiù—by its own energy.

My dear Lord, You alone create the universes. O Personality of Godhead, desiring to create these universes, You create them, maintain them and again wind them up by Your own energies, which are under the control of Your second energy, called yogamäyä, just as a spider creates a cobweb by its own energy and again winds it up.

PURPORT
In this verse two important words nullify the impersonalist theory that everything is God. Here Kardama says, "O Personality of Godhead, You are alone, but You have various energies." The example of the spider is very significant also. The spider is an individual living entity, and by its energy it creates a cobweb and plays on it, and whenever it likes it winds up the cobweb, thus ending the play. When the cobweb is manufactured by the saliva of the spider, the spider does not become impersonal. Similarly, the creation and manifestation of the material or spiritual energy does not render the creator impersonal. Here the very prayer suggests that God is sentient and can hear the prayers and fulfill the desires of the devotee. Therefore, He is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], the form of bliss, knowledge and eternity.

My dear Lord, although it is not Your desire, You manifest this creation of gross and subtle elements just for our sensual satisfaction. Let Your causeless mercy be upon us, for You have appeared before us in Your eternal form, adorned with a splendid wreath of tulasé leaves.

PURPORT
It is clearly stated here that the material world is not created by the personal will of the Supreme Lord; it is created by His external energy because the living entities want to enjoy it. This material world is not created for those who do not want to enjoy sense gratification, who constantly remain in transcendental loving service and who are eternally Kåñëa conscious. For them, the spiritual world is eternally existing, and they enjoy there. Elsewhere in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that for those who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this material world is useless; because this material world is full of danger at every step, it is not meant for the devotees but for living entities who want to lord it over the material energy at their own risk. Kåñëa is so kind that He allows the sense-enjoying living entities a separate world created by Him to enjoy as they like, yet at the same time He appears in His personal form. The Lord unwillingly creates this material world, but He descends in His personal form or sends one of His reliable sons or a servant or a reliable author like Vyäsadeva to give instruction. He Himself also instructs in His speeches of Bhagavad-gétä. This propaganda work goes on side by side with the creation to convince the misguided living entities who are rotting in this material world to come back to Him and surrender unto Him. Therefore the last instruction of Bhagavad-gétä is this: "Give up all your manufactured engagements in the material world and just surrender unto Me. I shall protect you from all sinful reactions."

tam—that; tvä—You; anubhütyä—by realizing; uparata—disregarded; kriyä—enjoyment of fruitive activities; artham—in order that; sva-mäyayä—by Your own energy; vartita—brought about; loka-tantram—the material worlds; namämi—I offer obeisances; abhékñëam—continuously; namanéya—worshipable; päda-sarojam—lotus feet; alpéyasi—on the insignificant; käma—desires; varñam—showering.

I continuously offer my respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet, of which it is worthy to take shelter, because You shower all benedictions on the insignificant. To give all living entities detachment from fruitive activity by realizing You, You have expanded these material worlds by Your own energy.

PURPORT
Everyone, therefore, whether he desires material enjoyment, liberation or the transcendental loving service of the Lord, should engage himself, offering obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, because the Lord can award everyone his desired benediction. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord affirms, ye yathä mäà prapadyante: [Bg. 4.11] anyone who desires to be a successful enjoyer in this material world is awarded that benediction by the Lord, anyone who wants to be liberated from the entanglement of this material world is given liberation by the Lord, and anyone who desires to constantly engage in His service in full Kåñëa consciousness is awarded that benediction by the Lord. For material enjoyment He has prescribed so many ritualistic sacrificial performances in the Vedas, and thus people may take advantage of those instructions and enjoy material life in higher planets or in a noble aristocratic family. These processes are mentioned in the Vedas, and one can take advantage of them. It is similar with those who want to be liberated from this material world.
Unless one is disgusted with the enjoyment of this material world, he cannot aspire for liberation. Liberation is for one who is disgusted with material enjoyment. Vedänta-sütra says, therefore, athäto brahma jijïäsä: those who have given up the attempt to be happy in this material world can inquire about the Absolute Truth. For those who want to know the Absolute Truth, the Vedänta-sütra is available, as is Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the actual explanation of Vedänta-sütra. Since Bhagavad-gétä is also Vedänta-sütra, by understanding Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Vedänta-sütra or Bhagavad-gétä one can obtain real knowledge. When one obtains real knowledge, he becomes theoretically one with the Supreme, and when he actually begins the service of Brahman, or Kåñëa consciousness, he is not only liberated but situated in his spiritual life. Similarly, for those who want to lord it over material nature, there are so many departments of material enjoyment; material knowledge and material science are available, and the Lord provides for persons who want to enjoy them. The conclusion is that one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for any benediction. The word käma-varñam is very significant, for it indicates that He satisfies the desires of anyone who approaches Him. But one who sincerely loves Kåñëa and yet wants material enjoyment is in perplexity. Kåñëa, being very kind toward him, gives him an opportunity to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and so he gradually forgets the hallucination.

TEXT 27
aho päpacyamänänäà

aho—oh; päpacyamänänäm—with those being much afflicted; niraye—in the hellish material entanglement; svaiù—their own; amaìgalaiù—by misdeeds; kälena bhüyasä—after a long time; nünam—indeed; prasédanti—they are pleased; iha—in this world; devatäù—the demigods.

Kardama Muni said: Oh, after a long time the demigods of this universe have become pleased with the suffering souls who are in material entanglement because of their own misdeeds.

PURPORT
This material world is a place for suffering, which is due to the misdeeds of the inhabitants, the conditioned souls themselves. The sufferings are not extraneously imposed upon them; rather, the conditioned souls create their own suffering by their own acts. In the forest, fire takes place automatically. It is not that someone has to go there and set a fire; because of friction among various trees, fire occurs automatically. When there is too much heat from the forest fire of this material world, the demigods, including Brahmä himself, being harassed, approach the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and appeal to Him to alleviate the condition. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends. In other words, when the demigods become distressed by the sufferings of the conditioned souls, they approach the Lord to remedy the suffering, and the Personality of Godhead descends. When the Lord descends, all the demigods become enlivened. Therefore Kardama Muni said, "After many, many years of human suffering, all the demigods are now satisfied because Kapiladeva, the incarnation of Godhead, has appeared."

bahu—many; janma—after births; vipakvena—which is mature; samyak—perfect; yoga-samädhinä—by trance in yoga; drañöum—to see; yatante—they endeavor; yatayaù—the yogés; çünya-agäreñu—in secluded places; yat—whose; padam—feet.

After many births, mature yogés, by complete trance in yoga, endeavor in secluded places to see the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
Some important things are mentioned here about yoga. The word bahu janma-vipakvena means "after many, many births of mature yoga practice." And another word, samyag-yoga-samädhinä, means "by complete practice of the yoga system." Complete practice of yoga means bhakti-yoga; unless one comes to the point of bhakti-yoga, or surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's yoga practice is not complete. This same point is corroborated in the Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä. Bahünäà janmanäm ante: [Bg. 7.19] after many, many births, the jïäné who has matured in transcendental knowledge surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kardama Muni repeats the same statement. After many, many years and many, many births of complete practice of yoga, one can see the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord in a secluded place. It is not that after one practices some sitting postures he immediately becomes perfect. One has to perform yoga a long time—"many, many births"—to become mature, and a yogé has to practice in a secluded place. One cannot practice yoga in a city or in a public park and declare that he has become God simply by some exchange of dollars. This is all bogus propaganda. Those who are actually yogés practice in a secluded place, and after many, many births they become successful, provided they surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the completion of yoga.
TEXT 29

saù eva—that very same; bhagavän—Supreme Personality of Godhead; adya—today; helanam—negligence; na—not; gaëayya—considering high and low; naù—our; gåheñu—in the houses; jätaù—appeared; grämyäëäm—of ordinary householders; yaù—He who; svänäm—of His own devotees; pakña-poñaëaù—who supports the party.

Not considering the negligence of ordinary householders like us, that very same Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in our homes just to support His devotees.

PURPORT
Devotees are so affectionate toward the Personality of Godhead that although He does not appear before those who practice yoga in a secluded place even for many, many births, He agrees to appear in a householder's home where devotees engage in devotional service without material yoga practice. In other words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even a householder can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one of the members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He was a householder, although a yogé, but he had the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila Muni as his son.
Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it surpasses all other methods of transcendental realization. The Lord says, therefore, that He lives neither in Vaikuëöha nor in the heart of a yogé, but He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhakta-vatsala. He is never described as jïäné-vatsala or yogé-vatsala. He is always described as bhakta-vatsala because He is more inclined toward His devotees than toward other transcendentalists. In Bhagavad-gétä it is confirmed that only a devotee can understand Him as He is. Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti: [Bg. 18.55] "One can understand Me only by devotional service, not otherwise." That understanding alone is real because although jïänés, mental speculators, can realize only the effulgence, or the bodily luster, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and yogés can realize only the partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a bhakta not only realizes Him as He is but also associates with the Personality of Godhead face to face.

Kardama Muni said: You, my dear Lord, who are always increasing the honor of Your devotees, have descended in my home just to fulfill Your word and disseminate the process of real knowledge.

PURPORT
When the Lord appeared before Kardama Muni after his mature yoga practice, He promised that He would become Kardama's son. He descended as the son of Kardama Muni in order to fulfill that promise. Another purpose of His appearance is cikérñur bhagavän jïänam, to distribute knowledge. Therefore, He is called bhaktänäà mäna-vardhanaù, "He who increases the honor of His devotees." By distributing Säìkhya He would increase the honor of the devotees; therefore, Säìkhya philosophy is not dry mental speculation. Säìkhya philosophy means devotional service. How could the honor of the devotees be increased unless Säìkhya were meant for devotional service? Devotees are not interested in speculative knowledge; therefore, the Säìkhya enunciated by Kapila Muni is meant to establish one firmly in devotional service. Real knowledge and real liberation is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage in devotional service.

My dear Lord, although You have no material form, You have Your own innumerable forms. They truly are Your transcendental forms, which are pleasing to Your devotees.

PURPORT
In the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that the Lord is one Absolute but He has ananta, or innumerable, forms. Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam [Bs. 5.33]. The Lord is the original form, but still He has multiforms. Those multiforms are manifested by Him transcendentally, according to the tastes of His multidevotees. It is understood that once Hanumän, the great devotee of Lord Rämacandra, said that he knew that Näräyaëa, the husband of Lakñmé, and Räma, the husband of Sétä, are one and the same, and that there is no difference between Lakñmé and Sétä, but as for himself, he liked the form of Lord Räma. In a similar way, some devotees worship the original form of Kåñëa. When we say "Kåñëa" we refer to all forms of the Lord—not only Kåñëa but Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha, Näräyaëa, etc. The varieties of transcendental forms exist simultaneously. That is also stated in the Brahma-saàhitä: rämädi-mürtiñu ... nänävatäram. He already exists in multiforms, but none of the forms are material. Çrédhara Svämé has commented that arüpiëaù, "without form," means without material form. The Lord has form, otherwise how can it be stated here, täny eva te 'bhirüpäëi rüpäëi bhagavaàs tava: "You have Your forms, but they are not material. Materially You have no form, but spiritually, transcendentally, You have multiforms"? Mäyävädé philosophers cannot understand these transcendental forms of the Lord, and being disappointed, they say that the Supreme Lord is impersonal. But that is not a fact: whenever there is form there is a person. Many times in many Vedic literatures the Lord is described as puruña, which means "the original form, the original enjoyer." The conclusion is that the Lord has no material form and yet, according to the liking of different grades of devotees, He simultaneously exists in multiforms, such as Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha, Näräyaëa and Mukunda. There are many thousands and thousands of forms, but they are all viñëu-tattva, Kåñëa.

tväm—unto You; süribhiù—by the great sages; tattva—the Absolute Truth; bubhutsayä—with a desire to understand; addhä—certainly; sadä—always; abhiväda—of worshipful respects; arhaëa—which are worthy; päda—of Your feet; péöham—to the seat; aiçvarya—opulence; vairägya—renunciation; yaçaù—fame; avabodha—knowledge; vérya—strength; çriyä—with beauty; pürtam—who are full; aham—I; prapadye—surrender.

My dear Lord, Your lotus feet are the reservoir that always deserves to receive worshipful homage from all great sages eager to understand the Absolute Truth. You are full in opulence, renunciation, transcendental fame, knowledge, strength and beauty, and therefore I surrender myself unto Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
Actually, those who are searching after the Absolute Truth must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna many times to surrender unto Him, especially at the end of the Ninth Chapter—man-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù: "If you want to be perfect, just always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your obeisances to Me. In this way you will understand Me, the Personality of Godhead, and ultimately you will come back to Me, back to Godhead, back home." Why is it so? The Lord is always full in six opulences, as mentioned herein: wealth, renunciation, fame, knowledge, strength and beauty. The word pürtam means "in full." No one can claim that all wealth belongs to him, but Kåñëa can claim it, since He has full wealth. Similarly, He is full in knowledge, renunciation, strength and beauty. He is full in everything, and no one can surpass Him. Another one of Kåñëa's names is asamordhva, which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him.

ätmänubhütyänugata-prapaïcaà

param—transcendental; pradhänam—supreme; puruñam—person; mahäntam—who is the origin of the material world; kälam—who is time; kavim—fully cognizant; tri-våtam—three modes of material nature; loka-pälam—who is the maintainer of all the universes; ätma—in Himself; anubhütya—by internal potency; anugata—dissolved; prapaïcam—whose material manifestations; sva-chanda—independently; çaktim—who is powerful; kapilam—to Lord Kapila; prapadye—I surrender.

I surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, descended in the form of Kapila, who is independently powerful and transcendental, who is the Supreme Person and the Lord of the sum total of matter and the element of time, who is the fully cognizant maintainer of all the universes under the three modes of material nature, and who absorbs the material manifestations after their dissolution.

PURPORT
The six opulences—wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation—are indicated here by Kardama Muni, who addresses Kapila Muni, his son, as param. The word param is used in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, in the phrase paraà satyam, to refer to the summum bonum, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Param is explained further by the next word, pradhänam, which means the chief, the origin, the source of everything—sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]—the cause of all causes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not formless; He is puruñam, or the enjoyer, the original person. He is the time element and is all-cognizant. He knows everything—past, present and future—as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord says, "I know everything—present, past and future—in every corner of the universe." The material world, which is moving under the spell of the three modes of nature, is also a manifestation of His energy. Paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate: everything that we see is an interaction of His energies (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.8). Parasya brahmaëaù çaktis tathedam akhilaà jagat. This is the version of the Viñëu Puräëa. We can understand that whatever we see is an interaction of the three modes of material nature, but actually it is all an interaction of the Lord's energy. Loka-pälam: He is actually the maintainer of all living entities. Nityo nityänäm: He is the chief of all living entities; He is one, but He maintains many, many living entities. God maintains all other living entities, but no one can maintain God. That is His svacchanda-çakti; He is not dependent on others. Someone may call himself independent, but he is still dependent on someone higher. The Personality of Godhead, however, is absolute; there is no one higher than or equal to Him.
Kapila Muni appeared as the son of Kardama Muni, but because Kapila is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kardama Muni offered respectful obeisances unto Him with full surrender. Another word in this verse is very important: ätmänubhütyänugata-prapaïcam. The Lord descends either as Kapila or Räma, Nåsiàha or Varäha, and whatever forms He assumes in the material world are all manifestations of His own personal internal energy. They are never forms of the material energy. The ordinary living entities who are manifested in this material world have bodies created by the material energy, but when Kåñëa or any one of His expansions or parts of the expansions descends to this material world, although He appears to have a material body, His body is not material. He always has a transcendental body. But fools and rascals, who are called müòhas, consider Him one of them, and therefore they deride Him. They refuse to accept Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they cannot understand Him. In Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa says, avajänanti mäà müòhäù: [Bg. 9.11] "Those who are rascals and fools deride Me." When God descends in a form, this does not mean that He assumes His form with the help of the material energy. He manifests His spiritual form as He exists in His spiritual kingdom.

ä sma abhipåcche—I am inquiring; adya—now; patim—the Lord; prajänäm—of all created beings; tvayä—by You; avatérëa-åëaù—free from debts; uta—and; äpta—fulfilled; kämaù—desires; parivrajat—of an itinerant mendicant; padavém—the path; ästhitaù—accepting; aham—I; cariñye—I shall wander; tväm—You; hådi—in my heart; yuïjan—keeping; viçokaù—free from lamentation.

Today I have something to ask from You, who are the Lord of all living entities. Since I have now been liberated by You from my debts to my father, and since all my desires are fulfilled, I wish to accept the order of an itinerant mendicant. Renouncing this family life, I wish to wander about, free from lamentation, thinking always of You in my heart.

PURPORT
Actually, sannyäsa, or renunciation of material household life, necessitates complete absorption in Kåñëa consciousness and immersion in the self. One does not take sannyäsa, freedom from family responsibility in the renounced order of life, to make another family or to create an embarrassing transcendental fraud in the name of sannyäsa. The sannyäsé's business is not to become proprietor of so many things and amass money from the innocent public. A sannyäsé is proud that he is always thinking of Kåñëa within himself. Of course, there are two kinds of devotees of the Lord. One is called goñöhy-änandé, which means those who are preachers and have many followers for preaching the glories of the Lord and who live among those many, many followers just to organize missionary activities. Other devotees are ätmänandé, or self-satisfied, and do not take the risk of preaching work. They remain, therefore, alone with God. In this classification was Kardama Muni. He wanted to be free from all anxieties and remain alone within his heart with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Parivräja means "an itinerant mendicant." A mendicant sannyäsé should not live anywhere for more than three days. He must be always moving because his duty is to move from door to door and enlighten people about Kåñëa consciousness.

TEXT 12

so 'haà vrajämi çaraëaà hy akuto-bhayaà me

jantuù uväca—the human soul says; tasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; upasannam—having approached for protection; avitum—to protect; jagat—the universe; icchayä—by His own will; ätta-nänä-tanoù—who accepts various forms; bhuvi—on the earth; calat—walking; caraëa-aravindam—the lotus feet; saù aham—I myself; vrajämi—go; çaraëam—unto the shelter; hi—indeed; akutaù-bhayam—giving relief from all fear; me—for me; yena—by whom; édåçé—such; gatiù—condition of life; adarçi—was considered; asataù—impious; anurüpä—befitting.

The human soul says: I take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears in His various eternal forms and walks on the surface of the world. I take shelter of Him only, because He can give me relief from all fear and from Him I have received this condition of life, which is just befitting my impious activities.

PURPORT
The word calac-caraëäravindam refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who actually walks or travels upon the surface of the world. For example, Lord Rämacandra actually walked on the surface of the world, and Lord Kåñëa also walked just like an ordinary man. The prayer is therefore offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who descends to the surface of this earth, or any part of this universe, for the protection of the pious and the destruction of the impious. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä that when there is an increase of irreligion and discrepancies arise in the real religious activities, the Supreme Lord comes to protect the pious and kill the impious. This verse indicates Lord Kåñëa.
Another significant point in this verse is that the Lord comes, icchayä, by His own will. As Kåñëa confirms in Bhagavad-gétä, sambhavämy ätma-mäyayä: [Bg. 4.6] "I appear at My will, by My internal potential power." He is not forced to come by the laws of material nature. It is stated here, icchayä: He does not assume any form, as the impersonalists think, because He comes at His own will, and the form in which He descends is His eternal form. As the Supreme Lord puts the living entity into the condition of horrible existence, He can also deliver him, and therefore one should seek shelter at the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Kåñëa demands, "Give up everything and surrender unto Me." And it is also said in Bhagavad-gétä that anyone who approaches Him does not come back again to accept a form in material existence, but goes back to Godhead, back home, never to return.

yaù—who; tu—also; atra—here; baddhaù—bound; iva—as if; karmabhiù—by activities; ävåta—covered; ätmä—the pure soul; bhüta—the gross elements; indriya—the senses; äçaya—the mind; mayém—consisting of; avalambya—having fallen; mäyäm—into mäyä; äste—remains; viçuddham—completely pure; avikäram—without change; akhaëòa-bodham—possessed of unlimited knowledge; ätapyamäna—repentant; hådaye—in the heart; avasitam—residing; namämi—I offer my respectful obeisances.

I, the pure soul, appearing now bound by my activities, am lying in the womb of my mother by the arrangement of mäyä. I offer my respectful obeisances unto Him who is also here with me but who is unaffected and changeless. He is unlimited, but He is perceived in the repentant heart. To Him I offer my respectful obeisances.

PURPORT
As stated in the previous verse, the jéva soul says, "I take shelter of the Supreme Lord." Therefore, constitutionally, the jéva soul is the subordinate servitor of the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead. Both the Supreme Soul and the jéva soul are sitting in the same body, as confirmed in the Upaniñads. They are sitting as friends, but one is suffering, and the other is aloof from suffering.
In this verse it is said, viçuddham avikäram akhaëòa-bodham: the Supersoul is always sitting apart from all contamination. The living entity is contaminated and suffering because he has a material body, but that does not mean that because the Lord is also with him, He also has a material body. He is avikäram, changeless. He is always the same Supreme, but unfortunately the Mäyävädé philosophers, because of their impure hearts, cannot understand that the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, is different from the individual soul. It is said here, ätapyamäna-hådaye 'vasitam: He is in the heart of every living entity, but He can be realized only by a soul who is repentant. The individual soul becomes repentant that he forgot his constitutional position, wanted to become one with the Supreme Soul and tried his best to lord it over material nature. He has been baffled, and therefore he is repentant. At that time, Supersoul, or the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul, is realized. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, after many, many births the knowledge comes to the conditioned soul that Väsudeva is great, He is master, and He is Lord. The individual soul is the servant, and therefore he surrenders unto Him. At that time he becomes a mahätmä, a great soul. Therefore, a fortunate living being who comes to this understanding, even within the womb of his mother, has his liberation assured.

I am separated from the Supreme Lord because of my being in this material body, which is made of five elements, and therefore my qualities and senses are being misused, although I am essentially spiritual. Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to material nature and the living entities, because He is devoid of such a material body, and because He is always glorious in His spiritual qualities, I offer my obeisances unto Him.

PURPORT
The difference between the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is that the living entity is prone to be subjected to material nature, whereas the Supreme Godhead is always transcendental to material nature as well as to the living entities. When the living entity is put into material nature, then his senses and qualities are polluted, or designated. There is no possibility for the Supreme Lord to become embodied by material qualities or material senses, for He is above the influence of material nature and cannot possibly be put in the darkness of ignorance like the living entities. Because of His full knowledge, He is never subjected to the influence of material nature. Material nature is always under His control, and it is therefore not possible that material nature can control the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Since the identity of the living entity is very minute, he is prone to be subjected to material nature, but when he is freed from this material body, which is false, he attains the same, spiritual nature as the Supreme Lord. At that time there is no qualitative difference between him and the Supreme Lord, but because he is not so quantitatively powerful as to never be put under the influence of material nature, he is quantitatively different from the Lord.
The entire process of devotional service is to purify oneself of this contamination of material nature and put oneself on the spiritual platform, where he is qualitatively one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedas it is said that the living entity is always free. Asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù. The living entity is liberated. His material contamination is temporary, and his actual position is that he is liberated. This liberation is achieved by Kåñëa consciousness, which begins from the point of surrender. Therefore it is said here, "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person."

yat—of the Lord; mäyayä—by the mäyä; uru-guëa—arising from the great modes; karma—activities; nibandhane—with bonds; asmin—this; säàsärike—of repeated birth and death; pathi—on the path; caran—wandering; tat—of him; abhiçrameëa—with great pains; nañöa—lost; småtiù—memory; punaù—again; ayam—this living entity; pravåëéta—may realize; lokam—his true nature; yuktyä kayä—by what means; mahat-anugraham—the mercy of the Lord; antareëa—without.

The human soul further prays: The living entity is put under the influence of material nature and continues a hard struggle for existence on the path of repeated birth and death. This conditional life is due to his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, without the Lord's mercy, how can he again engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord?

PURPORT
The Mäyävädé philosophers say that simply by cultivation of knowledge by mental speculation, one can be liberated from the condition of material bondage. But here it is said one is liberated not by knowledge but by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The knowledge the conditioned soul gains by mental speculation, however powerful it may be, is always too imperfect to approach the Absolute Truth. It is said that without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot understand Him or His actual form, quality and name. Those who are not in devotional service go on speculating for many, many thousands of years, but they are still unable to understand the nature of the Absolute Truth.
One can be liberated in the knowledge of the Absolute Truth simply by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is clearly said herein that our memory is lost because we are now covered by His material energy. Arguments may be put forward as to why we have been put under the influence of this material energy by the supreme will of the Lord. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä, where the Lord says, "I am sitting in everyone's heart, and due to Me one is forgetful or one is alive in knowledge." The forgetfulness of the conditioned soul is also due to the direction of the Supreme Lord. A living entity misuses his little independence when he wants to lord it over material nature. This misuse of independence, which is called mäyä, is always available, otherwise there would be no independence. Independence implies that one can use it properly or improperly. It is not static; it is dynamic. Therefore, misuse of independence is the cause of being influenced by mäyä.
Mäyä is so strong that the Lord says that it is very difficult to surmount her influence. But one can do so very easily "if he surrenders unto Me." Mäm eva ye prapadyante: anyone who surrenders unto Him can overcome the influence of the stringent laws of material nature. It is clearly said here that a living entity is put under the influence of mäyä by His will, and if anyone wants to get out of this entanglement, this can be made possible simply by His mercy.
The activities of the conditioned souls under the influence of material nature are explained here. Every conditioned soul is engaged in different types of work under the influence of material nature. We can see in the material world that the conditioned soul acts so powerfully that he is playing wonderfully in creating the so-called advancements of material civilization for sense gratification. But actually his position is to know that he is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. When he is actually in perfect knowledge, he knows that the Lord is the supreme worshipable object and that the living entity is His eternal servant. Without this knowledge, he engages in material activities; that is called ignorance.
TEXT 16

trai-kälikaà sthira-careñv anuvartitäàçaù

jïänam—knowledge; yat—which; etat—this; adadhät—gave; katamaù—who other than; saù—that; devaù—the Personality of Godhead; trai-kälikam—of the three phases of time; sthira-careñu—in the inanimate and animate objects; anuvartita—dwelling; aàçaù—His partial representation; tam—unto Him; jéva—of the jéva souls; karma-padavém—the path of fruitive activities; anuvartamänäù—who are pursuing; täpa-traya—from the threefold miseries; upaçamanäya—for getting free; vayam—we; bhajema—must surrender.

No one other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the localized Paramätmä, the partial representation of the Lord, is directing all inanimate and animate objects. He is present in the three phases of time-past, present and future. Therefore, the conditioned soul is engaged in different activities by His direction, and in order to get free from the threefold miseries of this conditional life, we have to surrender unto Him only.

PURPORT
When a conditioned soul is seriously anxious to get out of the influence of the material clutches, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated within him as Paramätmä, gives him this knowledge: "Surrender unto Me." As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, "Give up all other engagements. Just surrender unto Me." It is to be accepted that the source of knowledge is the Supreme Person. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. Mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca [Bg. 15.15]. The Lord says, "Through Me one gets real knowledge and memory, and one also forgets through Me." To one who wants to be materially satisfied or who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord gives the opportunity to forget His service and engage in the so-called happiness of material activities. Similarly, when one is frustrated in lording it over material nature and is very serious about getting out of this material entanglement, the Lord, from within, gives him the knowledge that he has to surrender unto Him; then there is liberation.
This knowledge cannot be imparted by anyone other than the Supreme Lord or His representative. In the Caitanya-caritämåta Lord Caitanya instructs Rüpa Gosvämé that the living entities wander in life after life, undergoing the miserable conditions of material existence. But when one is very anxious to get free from the material entanglement, he gets enlightenment through a spiritual master and Kåñëa. This means that Kåñëa as the Supersoul is seated within the heart of the living entity, and when the living entity is serious, the Lord directs him to take shelter of His representative, a bona fide spiritual master. Directed from within and guided externally by the spiritual master, one attains the path of Kåñëa consciousness, which is the way out of the material clutches.
Therefore there is no possibility of one's being situated in his own position unless he is blessed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless he is enlightened with the supreme knowledge, one has to undergo the severe penalties of the hard struggle for existence in the material nature. The spiritual master is therefore the mercy manifestation of the Supreme Person. The conditioned soul has to take direct instruction from the spiritual master, and thus he gradually becomes enlightened to the path of Kåñëa consciousness. The seed of Kåñëa consciousness is sown within the heart of the conditioned soul, and when one hears instruction from the spiritual master, the seed fructifies, and one's life is blessed.

dehé—the embodied soul; anya-deha—of another body; vivare—in the abdomen; jaöhara—of the stomach; agninä—by the fire; asåk—of blood; viö—stool; mütra—and urine; küpa—in a pool; patitaù—fallen; bhåça—strongly; tapta—scorched; dehaù—his body; icchan—desiring; itaù—from that place; vivasitum—to get out; gaëayan—counting; svamäsän—his months; nirväsyate—will be released; kåpaëa-dhéù—person of miserly intelligence; bhagavan—O Lord; kadä—when; nu—indeed.

Fallen into a pool of blood, stool and urine within the abdomen of his mother, his own body scorched by the mother's gastric fire, the embodied soul, anxious to get out, counts his months and prays, "O my Lord, when shall I, a wretched soul, be released from this confinement?"

PURPORT
The precarious condition of the living entity within the womb of his mother is described here. On one side of where the child is floating is the heat of gastric fire, and on the other side are urine, stool, blood and discharges. After seven months the child, who has regained his consciousness, feels the horrible condition of his existence and prays to the Lord. Counting the months until his release, he becomes greatly anxious to get out of the confinement. The so-called civilized man does not take account of this horrible condition of life, and sometimes, for the purpose of sense gratification, he tries to kill the child by methods of contraception or abortion. Unserious about the horrible condition in the womb, such persons continue in materialism, grossly misusing the chance of the human form of life.
The word kåpaëa-dhéù is significant in this verse. Dhé means "intelligence," and kåpaëa means "miserly." Conditional life is for persons who are of miserly intelligence or who do not properly utilize their intelligence. In the human form of life the intelligence is developed, and one has to utilize that developed intelligence to get out of the cycle of birth and death. One who does not do so is a miser, just like a person who has immense wealth but does not utilize it, keeping it simply to see. A person who does not actually utilize his human intelligence to get out of the clutches of mäyä, the cycle of birth and death, is accepted as miserly. The exact opposite of miserly is udära, "very magnanimous." A brähmaëa is called udära because he utilizes his human intelligence for spiritual realization. He uses that intelligence to preach Kåñëa consciousness for the benefit of the public, and therefore he is magnanimous.

My dear Lord, by Your causeless mercy I am awakened to consciousness, although I am only ten months old. For this causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the friend of all fallen souls, there is no way to express my gratitude but to pray with folded hands.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, intelligence and forgetfulness are both supplied by the Supersoul sitting with the individual soul within the body. When He sees that a conditioned soul is very serious about getting out of the clutches of the material influence, the Supreme Lord gives intelligence internally as Supersoul and externally as the spiritual master, or, as an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Himself, He helps by speaking instructions such as Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is always seeking the opportunity to reclaim the fallen souls to His abode, the kingdom of God. We should always feel very much obliged to the Personality of Godhead, for He is always anxious to bring us into the happy condition of eternal life. There is no sufficient means to repay the Personality of Godhead for His act of benediction; therefore, we can simply feel gratitude and pray to the Lord with folded hands. This prayer of the child in the womb may be questioned by some atheistic people. How can a child pray in such a nice way in the womb of his mother? Everything is possible by the grace of the Lord. The child is put into such a precarious condition externally, but internally he is the same, and the Lord is there. By the transcendental energy of the Lord, everything is possible.

The living entity in another type of body sees only by instinct; he knows only the agreeable and disagreeable sense perceptions of that particular body. But I have a body in which I can control my senses and can understand my destination; therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whom I have been blessed with this body and by whose grace I can see Him within and without.

PURPORT
The evolutionary process of different types of bodies is something like that of a fructifying flower. Just as there are different stages in the growth of a flower—the bud stage, the blooming stage and the full—fledged, grown-up stage of aroma and beauty—similarly, there are 8,400,000 species of bodies in gradual evolution, and there is systematic progress from the lower species of life to the higher. The human form of life is supposed to be the highest, for it offers consciousness for getting out of the clutches of birth and death. The fortunate child in the womb of his mother realizes his superior position and is thereby distinguished from other bodies. Animals in bodies lower than that of the human being are conscious only as far as their bodily distress and happiness are concerned; they cannot think of more than their bodily necessities of life-eating, sleeping, mating and defending. But in the human form of life, by the grace of God, the consciousness is so developed that a man can evaluate his exceptional position and thus realize the self and the Supreme Lord.
The word dama-çaréré means that we have a body in which we can control the senses and the mind. The complication of materialistic life is due to an uncontrolled mind and uncontrolled senses. One should feel grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having obtained such a nice human form of body, and one should properly utilize it. The distinction between an animal and a man is that the animal cannot control himself and has no sense of decency, whereas the human being has the sense of decency and can control himself. If this controlling power is not exhibited by the human being, then he is no better than an animal. By controlling the senses, or by the process of yoga regulation, one can understand the position of his self, the Supersoul, the world and their interrelation; everything is possible by controlling the senses. Otherwise, we are no better than animals.
Real self-realization by means of controlling the senses is explained herein. One should try to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead and one's own self also. To think oneself the same as the Supreme is not self-realization. Here it is clearly explained that the Supreme Lord is anädi, or puräëa, and He has no other cause. The living entity is born of the Supreme Godhead as part and parcel. It is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä, anädir ädir govindaù: [Bs. 5.1] Govinda, the Supreme person, has no cause. He is unborn. But the living entity is born of Him. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, mamaiväàçaù: both the living entity and the Supreme Lord are unborn, but it has to be understood that the supreme cause of the part and parcel is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma-saàhitä therefore says that everything has come from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]). The Vedänta-sütra confirms this also. Janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] the Absolute Truth is the original source of everyone's birth. Kåñëa also says in Bhagavad-gétä, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù: [Bg. 10.8] "I am the source of birth of everything, including Brahmä and Lord Çiva and the living entities." This is self-realization. One should know that he is under the control of the Supreme Lord and not think that he is fully independent. Otherwise, why should he be put into conditional life?
TEXT 20
so 'haà vasann api vibho bahu-duùkha-väsaà
garbhän na nirjigamiñe bahir andha-küpe
yatropayätam upasarpati deva-mäyä
mithyä matir yad-anu saàsåti-cakram etat


saù aham—I myself; vasan—living; api—although; vibho—O Lord; bahu-duùkha—with many miseries; väsam—in a condition; garbhät—from the abdomen; na—not; nirjigamiñe—I wish to depart; bahiù—outside; andha-küpe—in the blind well; yatra—where; upayätam—one who goes there; upasarpati—she captures; deva-mäyä—the external energy of the Lord; mithyä—false; matiù—identification; yat—which mäyä; anu—according to; saàsåti—of continual birth and death; cakram—cycle; etat—this.

Therefore, my Lord, although I am living in a terrible condition, I do not wish to depart from my mother's abdomen to fall again into the blind well of materialistic life. Your external energy, called deva-mäyä, at once captures the newly born child, and immediately false identification, which is the beginning of the cycle of continual birth and death, begins.

PURPORT
As long as the child is within the womb of his mother, he is in a very precarious and horrible condition of life, but the benefit is that he revives pure consciousness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord and prays for deliverance. But once he is outside the abdomen, when a child is born, mäyä, or the illusory energy, is so strong that he is immediately overpowered into considering his body to be his self. Mäyä means "illusion," or that which is actually not. In the material world, everyone is identifying with his body. This false egoistic consciousness of "I am this body" at once develops after the child comes out of the womb. The mother and other relatives are awaiting the child, and as soon as he is born, the mother feeds him, and everyone takes care of him. The living entity soon forgets his position and becomes entangled in bodily relationships. The entire material existence is entanglement in this bodily conception of life. Real knowledge means to develop the consciousness of "I am not this body. I am spirit soul, an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord." Real knowledge entails renunciation, or nonacceptance of this body as the self.
By the influence of mäyä, the external energy, one forgets everything just after birth. Therefore the child is praying that he prefers to remain within the womb rather than come out. It is said that Çukadeva Gosvämé, on this consideration, remained for sixteen years within the womb of his mother; he did not want to be entangled in false bodily identification. After cultivating such knowledge within the womb of his mother, he came out at the end of sixteen years and immediately left home so that he might not be captured by the influence of mäyä. The influence of mäyä is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä as insurmountable. But insurmountable mäyä can be overcome simply by Kåñëa consciousness. That is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (7.14): mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te. Whoever surrenders unto the lotus feet of Kåñëa can get out of this false conception of life. By the influence of mäyä only, one forgets his eternal relationship with Kåñëa and identifies himself with his body and the by-products of the body—namely wife, children, society, friendship and love. Thus he becomes a victim of the influence of mäyä, and his materialistic life of continued birth and death becomes still more stringent.
TEXT 21
tasmäd ahaà vigata-viklava uddhariñya
ätmänam äçu tamasaù suhådätmanaiva
bhüyo yathä vyasanam etad aneka-randhraà
mä me bhaviñyad upasädita-viñëu-pädaù


tasmät—therefore; aham—I; vigata—ceased; viklavaù—agitation; uddhariñye—shall deliver; ätmänam—myself; äçu—quickly; tamasaù—from the darkness; suhådä ätmanä—with friendly intelligence; eva—indeed; bhüyaù—again; yathä—so that; vyasanam—plight; etat—this; aneka-randhram—entering many wombs; mä—not; me—my; bhaviñyat—may occur; upasädita—placed (in my mind); viñëu-pädaù—the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu.

Therefore, without being agitated any more, I shall deliver myself from the darkness of nescience with the help of my friend, clear consciousness. Simply by keeping the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu in my mind, I shall be saved from entering into the wombs of many mothers for repeated birth and death.

PURPORT
The miseries of material existence begin from the very day when the spirit soul takes shelter in the ovum and sperm of the mother and father, they continue after he is born from the womb, and then they are further prolonged. We do not know where the suffering ends. It does not end, however, by one's changing his body. The change of body is taking place at every moment, but that does not mean that we are improving from the fetal condition of life to a more comfortable condition. The best thing is, therefore, to develop Kåñëa consciousness. Here it is stated, upasädita-viñëu-pädaù. This means realization of Kåñëa consciousness. One who is intelligent, by the grace of the Lord, and develops Kåñëa consciousness, is successful in his life because simply by keeping himself in Kåñëa consciousness, he will be saved from the repetition of birth and death.
The child prays that it is better to remain within the womb of darkness and be constantly absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness than to get out and again fall a victim to the illusory energy. The illusory energy acts within the abdomen as well as outside the abdomen, but the trick is that one should remain Kåñëa conscious, and then the effect of such a horrible condition cannot act unfavorably upon him. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that one's intelligence is his friend, and the same intelligence can also be his enemy. Here also the same idea is repeated: suhådätmanaiva, friendly intelligence. Absorption of intelligence in the personal service of Kåñëa and full consciousness of Kåñëa always are the path of self-realization and liberation. Without being unnecessarily agitated, if we take to the process of Kåñëa consciousness by constantly chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, the cycle of birth and death can be stopped for good.
It may be questioned herein how the child can be fully Kåñëa conscious within the womb of the mother without any paraphernalia with which to execute Kåñëa consciousness. It is not necessary to arrange for paraphernalia to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. The child wants to remain within the abdomen of its mother and at the same time wants to become free from the clutches of mäyä. One does not need any material arrangement to cultivate Kåñëa consciousness. One can cultivate Kåñëa consciousness anywhere and everywhere, provided he can always think of Kåñëa. The mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, can be chanted even within the abdomen of one's mother. One can chant while sleeping, while working, while imprisoned in the womb or while outside. This Kåñëa consciousness cannot be checked in any circumstance. The conclusion of the child's prayer is: "Let me remain in this condition; although it is very miserable, it is better not to fall a victim to mäyä again by going outside."


Song-10 Prayers by Mother Devahuti (SB 3.33.2-8)
TEXT 2
devahütir uväca
athäpy ajo 'ntaù-salile çayänaà
bhütendriyärthätma-mayaà vapus te
guëa-pravähaà sad-açeña-béjaà
dadhyau svayaà yaj-jaöharäbja-jätaù


devahütiù uväca—Devahüti said; atha api—moreover; ajaù—Lord Brahmä; antaù-salile—in the water; çayänam—lying; bhüta—the material elements; indriya—the senses; artha—the sense objects; ätma—the mind; mayam—pervaded by; vapuù—body; te—Your; guëa-praväham—the source of the stream of the three modes of material nature; sat—manifest; açeña—of all; béjam—the seed; dadhyau—meditated upon; svayam—himself; yat—of whom; jaöhara—from the abdomen; abja—from the lotus flower; jätaù—born.

Devahüti said: Brahmä is said to be unborn because he takes birth from the lotus flower which grows from Your abdomen while You lie in the ocean at the bottom of the universe. But even Brahmä simply meditated upon You, whose body is the source of unlimited universes.

PURPORT
Brahmä is also named Aja, "he who is unborn." Whenever we think of someone's birth, there must be a material father and mother, for thus one is born. But Brahmä, being the first living creature within this universe, was born directly from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is known as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Viñëu form lying down in the ocean at the bottom of the universe. Devahüti wanted to impress upon the Lord that when Brahmä wants to see Him, he has to meditate upon Him. "You are the seed of all creation," she said. "Although Brahmä was directly born from You, he still has to perform many years of meditation, and even then he cannot see You directly, face to face. Your body is lying within the vast water at the bottom of the universe, and thus You are known as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu."
The nature of the Lord's gigantic body is also explained in this verse. That body is transcendental, untouched by matter. Since the material manifestation has come from His body, His body therefore existed before the material creation. The conclusion is that the transcendental body of Viñëu is not made of material elements. The body of Viñëu is the source of all other living entities, as well as the material nature, which is also supposed to be the energy of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devahüti said, "You are the background of the material manifestation and all created energy; therefore Your delivering me from the clutches of mäyä by explaining the system of Säìkhya philosophy is not so astonishing. But Your being born from my abdomen is certainly wonderful because although You are the source of all creation, You have so kindly taken birth as my child. That is most wonderful. Your body is the source of all the universe, and still You put Your body within the abdomen of a common woman like me. To me, that is most astonishing."
TEXT 3
sa eva viçvasya bhavän vidhatte
guëa-praväheëa vibhakta-véryaù
sargädy aného 'vitathäbhisandhir
ätmeçvaro 'tarkya-sahasra-çaktiù


saù—that very person; eva—certainly; viçvasya—of the universe; bhavän—You; vidhatte—carry on; guëa-praväheëa—by the interaction of the modes; vibhakta—divided; véryaù—Your energies; sarga-ädi—the creation and so on; anéhaù—the nondoer; avitatha—not futile; abhisandhiù—Your determination; ätma-éçvaraù—the Lord of all living entities; atarkya—inconceivable; sahasra—thousands; çaktiù—possessing energies.

My dear Lord, although personally You have nothing to do, You have distributed Your energies in the interactions of the material modes of nature, and for that reason the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation take place. My dear Lord, You are self-determined and are the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities. For them You created this material manifestation, and although You are one, Your diverse energies can act multifariously. This is inconceivable to us.

PURPORT
The statement made in this verse by Devahüti that the Absolute Truth has many diverse energies although He personally has nothing to do is confirmed in the Upaniñads. There is no one greater than Him or on an equal level with Him, and everything is completely done by His energy, as if by nature. It is understood herein, therefore, that although the modes of material nature are entrusted to different manifestations like Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva, each of whom is particularly invested with different kinds of power, the Supreme Lord is completely aloof from such activities. Devahüti is saying, "Although You personally are not doing anything, Your determination is absolute. There is no question of Your fulfilling Your will with the help of anyone else besides Yourself. You are, in the end, the Supreme Soul and the supreme controller. Your will, therefore, cannot be checked by anyone else." The Supreme Lord can check others' plans. As it is said, "Man proposes and God disposes." But when the Supreme Personality of Godhead proposes, that desire is under no one else's control. He is absolute. We are ultimately dependent on Him to fulfill our desires, but we cannot say that God's desires are also dependent. That is His inconceivable power. That which may be inconceivable for ordinary living entities is easily done by Him. And in spite of His being unlimited, He has subjected Himself to being known from the authoritative scriptures like the Vedic literatures. As it is said, çabda-mülatvät: He can be known through the çabda-brahma, or Vedic literature.
Why is the creation made? Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities, He created this material manifestation for those living entities who want to enjoy or lord it over material nature. As the Supreme Godhead, He arranges to fulfill their various desires. It is confirmed also in the Vedas, eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän: the supreme one supplies the necessities of the many living entities. There is no limit to the demands of the different kinds of living entities, and the supreme one, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, alone maintains them and supplies them by His inconceivable energy.
TEXT 4
sa tvaà bhåto me jaöhareëa nätha
kathaà nu yasyodara etad äsét

saù—that very person; tvam—You; bhåtaù—took birth; me jaöhareëa—by my abdomen; nätha—O my Lord; katham—how; nu—then; yasya—of whom; udare—in the belly; etat—this; äsét—did rest; viçvam—universe; yuga-ante—at the end of the millennium; vaöa-patre—on the leaf of a banyan tree; ekaù—alone; çete sma—You lay down; mäyä—possessing inconceivable powers; çiçuù—a baby; aìghri—Your toe; pänaù—licking.

As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, You have taken birth from my abdomen. O my Lord, how is that possible for the supreme one, who has in His belly all the cosmic manifestation? The answer is that it is possible, for at the end of the millennium You lie down on a leaf of a banyan tree, and just like a small baby, You lick the toe of Your lotus foot.

PURPORT
At the time of dissolution the Lord sometimes appears as a small baby lying on a leaf of a banyan tree, floating on the devastating water. Therefore Devahüti suggests, "Your lying down within the abdomen of a common woman like me is not so astonishing. You can lie down on the leaf of a banyan tree and float on the water of devastation as a small baby. It is not very wonderful, therefore, that You can lie down in the abdomen of my body. You teach us that those who are very fond of children within this material world and who therefore enter into marriage to enjoy family life with children can also have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their child, and the most wonderful thing is that the Lord Himself licks His toe."
Since all the great sages and devotees apply all energy and all activities in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there must be some transcendental pleasure in the toes of His lotus feet. The Lord licks His toe to taste the nectar for which the devotees always aspire. Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself wonders how much transcendental pleasure is within Himself, and in order to taste His own potency, He sometimes takes the position of tasting Himself. Lord Caitanya is Kåñëa Himself, but He appears as a devotee to taste the sweetness of the transcendental mellow in Himself which is tasted by Çrématé Rädhäräëé, the greatest of all devotees.

tvam—You; deha—this body; tantraù—have assumed; praçamäya—for the diminution; päpmanäm—of sinful activities; nideça-bhäjäm—of instructions in devotion; ca—and; vibho—O my Lord; vibhütaye—for the expansion; yathä—as; avatäräù—incarnations; tava—Your; sükara-ädayaù—the boar and other forms; tathä—so; ayam—this incarnation of Kapila; api—surely; ätma-patha—the path of self-realization; upalabdhaye—in order to reveal.

My dear Lord, You have assumed this body in order to diminish the sinful activities of the fallen and to enrich their knowledge in devotion and liberation. Since these sinful people are dependent on Your direction, by Your own will You assume incarnations as a boar and as other forms. Similarly, You have appeared in order to distribute transcendental knowledge to Your dependents.

PURPORT
In the previous verses, the general transcendental qualifications of the Supreme Personality of Godhead were described. Now the specific purpose of the Lord's appearance is also described. By His different energies He bestows different kinds of bodies upon the living entities, who are conditioned by their propensity to lord it over material nature, but in course of time these living entities become so degraded that they need enlightenment. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that whenever there are discrepancies in the discharge of the real purpose of this material existence, the Lord appears as an incarnation. The Lord's form as Kapila directs the fallen souls and enriches them with knowledge and devotion so that they may go back to Godhead. There are many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, like those of the boar, the fish, the tortoise and the half-man half-lion. Lord Kapiladeva is also one of the incarnations of Godhead. It is accepted herein that Lord Kapiladeva appeared on the surface of the earth to give transcendental knowledge to the misguided conditioned souls.
TEXT 6
yan-nämadheya-çravaëänukértanäd
yat-prahvaëäd yat-smaraëäd api kvacit
çvädo 'pi sadyaù savanäya kalpate
kutaù punas te bhagavan nu darçanät


yat—of whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); nämadheya—the name; çravaëa—hearing; anukértanät—by chanting; yat—to whom; prahvaëät—by offering obeisances; yat—whom; smaraëät—by remembering; api—even; kvacit—at any time; çva-adaù—a dog-eater; api—even; sadyaù—immediately; savanäya—for performing Vedic sacrifices; kalpate—becomes eligible; kutaù—what to speak of; punaù—again; te—You; bhagavan—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; nu—then; darçanät—by seeing face to face.

To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.

PURPORT
Herein the spiritual potency of chanting, hearing or remembering the holy name of the Supreme Lord is greatly stressed. Rüpa Gosvämé has discussed the sequence of sinful activities of the conditioned soul, and he has established, in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, that those who engage in devotional service become freed from the reactions of all sinful activities. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord says that He takes charge of one who surrenders unto Him, and He makes him immune to all reactions to sinful activities. If by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one becomes so swiftly cleared of all reactions to sinful activities, then what is to be said of those persons who see Him face to face?
Another consideration here is that persons who are purified by the process of chanting and hearing become immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. Generally, only a person who is born in a family of brähmaëas, who has been reformed by the ten kinds of purificatory processes and who is learned in Vedic literature is allowed to perform the Vedic sacrifices. But here the word sadyaù, "immediately," is used, and Çrédhara Svämé also remarks that one can immediately become eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. A person born in a family of the low caste which is accustomed to eat dogs is so positioned due to his past sinful activities, but by chanting or hearing once in pureness, or in an offenseless manner, he is immediately relieved of the sinful reaction. Not only is he relieved of the sinful reaction, but he immediately achieves the result of all purificatory processes. Taking birth in the family of a brähmaëa is certainly due to pious activities in one's past life. But still a child who is born in a family of a brähmaëa depends for his further reformation upon initiation into acceptance of a sacred thread and many other reformatory processes. But a person who chants the holy name of the Lord, even if born in a family of caëòälas, dog-eaters, does not need reformation. Simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa, he immediately becomes purified and becomes as good as the most learned brähmaëa.
Çrédhara Svämé especially remarks in this connection, anena püjyatvaà lakñyate. Some caste brähmaëas remark that by chanting Hare Kåñëa, purification begins. Of course, that depends on the individual process of chanting, but this remark of Çrédhara Svämé's is completely applicable if one chants the holy name of the Lord without offense, for he immediately becomes more than a brähmaëa. As Çrédhara Svämé says, püjyatvam: he immediately becomes as respectable as a most learned brähmaëa and can be allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. If simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes sanctified instantly, then what can be said of those persons who see the Supreme Lord face to face and who understand the descent of the Lord, as Devahüti understands Kapiladeva.
Usually, initiation depends on the bona fide spiritual master, who directs the disciple. If he sees that a disciple has become competent and purified by the process of chanting, he offers the sacred thread to the disciple just so that he will be recognized as one-hundred-percent equal with a brähmaëa. This is also confirmed in the Hari-bhakti-viläsa by Çré Sanätana Gosvämé: "As a base metal like bell metal can be changed into gold by a chemical process, any person can similarly be changed into a brähmaëa by dékñä-vidhäna, the initiation process".
It is sometimes remarked that by the chanting process one begins to purify himself and can take birth in his next life in a brähmaëa family and then be reformed. But at this present moment, even those who are born in the best brähmaëa families are not reformed, nor is there any certainty that they are actually born of brähmaëa fathers. Formerly the garbhädhäna reformatory system was prevalent, but at the present moment there is no such garbhädhäna, or seed-giving ceremony. Under these circumstances, no one knows if a man is factually born of a brähmaëa father. Whether one has acquired the qualification of a brähmaëa depends on the judgment of the bona fide spiritual master. He bestows upon the disciple the position of a brähmaëa by his own judgment. When one is accepted as a brähmaëa in the sacred thread ceremony under the päïcarätrika system, then he is dvija, twice-born. That is confirmed by Sanätana Gosvämé: dvijatvaà jäyate. By the process of initiation by the spiritual master, a person is accepted as a brähmaëa in his purified state of chanting the holy name of the Lord. He then makes further progress to become a qualified Vaiñëava, which means that the brahminical qualification is already acquired.
TEXT 7
aho bata çva-paco 'to garéyän
yaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam
tepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä
brahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te


aho bata—oh, how glorious; çva-pacaù—a dog-eater; ataù—hence; garéyän—worshipable; yat—of whom; jihvä-agre—on the tip of the tongue; vartate—is; näma—the holy name; tubhyam—unto You; tepuù tapaù—practiced austerities; te—they; juhuvuù—executed fire sacrifices; sasnuù—took bath in the sacred rivers; äryäù—Äryans; brahma anücuù—studied the Vedas; näma—the holy name; gåëanti—accept; ye—they who; te—Your.

Oh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the Äryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required.

PURPORT
As it is stated in the previous verse, a person who has once offenselessly chanted the holy name of God becomes immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. One should not be astonished by this statement of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. One should not disbelieve or think, "How by chanting the holy name of the Lord can one become a holy man to be compared to the most elevated brähmaëa?" To eradicate such doubts in the minds of unbelievers, this verse affirms that the stage of chanting of the holy name of the Lord is not sudden, but that the chanters have already performed all kinds of Vedic rituals and sacrifices. It is not very astounding, for no one in this life can chant the holy name of the Lord unless he has passed all lower stages, such as performing the Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, studying the Vedas and practicing good behavior like that of the Äryans. All this must first have been done. Just as a student in a law class is to be understood to have already graduated from general education, anyone who is engaged in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—must have already passed all lower stages. It is said that those who simply chant the holy name with the tip of the tongue are glorious. One does not even have to chant the holy name and understand the whole procedure, namely the offensive stage, offenseless stage and pure stage; if the holy name is sounded on the tip of the tongue, that is also sufficient. It is said herein that näma, a singular number, one name, Kåñëa or Räma, is sufficient. It is not that one has to chant all the holy names of the Lord. The holy names of the Lord are innumerable, and one does not have to chant all the names to prove that he has already undergone all the processes of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. If one chants once only, it is to be understood that he has already passed all the examinations, not to speak of those who are chanting always, twenty-four hours a day. It is specifically said here, tubhyam: "unto You only." One must chant God's name, not, as the Mäyävädé philosophers say, any name, such as a demigod's name or the names of God's energies. Only the holy name of the Supreme Lord will be effective. Anyone who compares the holy name of the Supreme Lord to the names of the demigods is called päñaëòé, or an offender.
The holy name has to be chanted to please the Supreme Lord, and not for any sense gratification or professional purpose. If this pure mentality is there, then even though a person is born of a low family, such as a dog-eater's, he is so glorious that not only has he purified himself, but he is quite competent to deliver others. He is competent to speak on the importance of the transcendental name, just as Öhäkura Haridäsa did. He was apparently born in a family of Muhammadans, but because he was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord offenselessly, Lord Caitanya empowered him to become the authority, or äcärya, of spreading the name. It did not matter that he was born in a family which was not following the Vedic rules and regulations. Caitanya Mahäprabhu and Advaita Prabhu accepted him as an authority because he was offenselessly chanting the name of the Lord. Authorities like Advaita Prabhu and Lord Caitanya immediately accepted that he had already performed all kinds of austerities, studied the Vedas and performed all sacrifices. That is automatically understood. There is a hereditary class of brähmaëas called the smärta-brähmaëas, however, who are of the opinion that even if such persons who are chanting the holy name of the Lord are accepted as purified, they still have to perform the Vedic rites or await their next birth in a family of brähmaëas so that they can perform the Vedic rituals. But actually that is not the case. Such a man does not need to wait for the next birth to become purified. He is at once purified. It is understood that he has already performed all sorts of rites. It is the so-called brähmaëas who actually have to undergo different kinds of austerities before reaching that point of purification. There are many other Vedic performances which are not described here. All such Vedic rituals have been already performed by the chanters of the holy name.
The word juhuvuù means that the chanters of the holy name have already performed all kinds of sacrifices. Sasnuù means that they have already traveled to all the holy places of pilgrimage and taken part in purificatory activities at those places. They are called äryäù because they have already finished all these requirements, and therefore they must be among the Äryans or those who have qualified themselves to become Äryans. "Äryan" refers to those who are civilized, whose manners are regulated according to the Vedic rituals. Any devotee who is chanting the holy name of the Lord is the best kind of Äryan. Unless one studies the Vedas, one cannot become an Äryan, but it is automatically understood that the chanters have already studied all the Vedic literature. The specific word used here is anücuù, which means that because they have already completed all those recommended acts, they have become qualified to be spiritual masters.
The very word gåëanti, which is used in this verse, means to be already established in the perfectional stage of ritualistic performances. If one is seated on the bench of a high-court and is giving judgment on cases, it means that he has already passed all legal exams and is better than those who are engaged in the study of law or those expecting to study law in the future. In a similar way, persons who are chanting the holy name are transcendental to those who are factually performing the Vedic rituals and those who expect to be qualified (or, in other words, those who are born in families of brähmaëas but have not yet undergone the reformatory processes and who therefore expect to study the Vedic rituals and perform the sacrifices in the future).
There are many Vedic statements in different places saying that anyone who chants the holy name of the Lord becomes immediately freed from conditional life and that anyone who hears the holy name of the Lord, even though born of a family of dog-eaters, also becomes liberated from the clutches of material entanglement.
TEXT 8
taà tväm ahaà brahma paraà pumäàsaà
pratyak-srotasy ätmani saàvibhävyam
sva-tejasä dhvasta-guëa-pravähaà
vande viñëuà kapilaà veda-garbham


tam—unto Him; tväm—You; aham—I; brahma—Brahman; param—supreme; pumäàsam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; pratyak-srotasi—turned inwards; ätmani—in the mind; saàvibhävyam—meditated upon, perceived; sva-tejasä—by Your own potency; dhvasta—vanished; guëa-praväham—the influence of the modes of material nature; vande—I offer obeisances; viñëum—unto Lord Viñëu; kapilam—named Kapila; veda-garbham—the repository of the Vedas.

I believe, my Lord, that You are Lord Viñëu Himself under the name of Kapila, and You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman! The saints and sages, being freed from all the disturbances of the senses and mind, meditate upon You, for by Your mercy only can one become free from the clutches of the three modes of material nature. At the time of dissolution, all the Vedas are sustained in You only.

PURPORT
Devahüti, the mother of Kapila, instead of prolonging her prayers, summarized that Lord Kapila was none other than Viñëu and that since she was a woman it was not possible for her to worship Him properly simply by prayer. It was her intention that the Lord be satisfied. The word pratyak is significant. In yogic practice, the eight divisions are yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna and samädhi. Pratyähära means to wind up the activities of the senses. The level of realization of the Supreme Lord evidenced by Devahüti is possible when one is able to withdraw the senses from material activities. When one is engaged in devotional service, there is no scope for his senses to be engaged otherwise. In such full Kåñëa consciousness, one can understand the Supreme Lord as He is.

But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or other he gathered his senses, and with folded hands and sweet words he began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe. The great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahmä, Lord Viñëu and Lord Çiva, you have divided yourself into three bodies by accepting the three modes of material nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all of you and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my prayer.
PURPORT
Atri Åñi called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, jagad-éçvara, the Lord of the universe. The Lord must exist before the creation, otherwise how could He be its Lord? If someone constructs a big building, this indicates that he must have existed before the building was constructed. Therefore the Supreme Lord, the creator of the universe, must be transcendental to the material modes of nature. But it is known that Viñëu takes charge of the mode of goodness, Brahmä takes charge of the mode of passion, and Lord Çiva takes charge of the mode of ignorance. Therefore Atri Muni said, "That jagad-éçvara, the Lord of the universe, must be one of you, but since three of you have appeared, I cannot recognize whom I have called. You are all so kind. Please let me know who is actually jagad-éçvara, the Lord of the universe." In fact, Atri Åñi was doubtful about the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, but he was quite certain that the Lord of the universe cannot be one of the creatures created by mäyä. His very inquiry about whom he had called indicates that he was in doubt about the constitutional position of the Lord. Therefore he prayed to all three, "Kindly let me know who is the transcendental Lord of the universe." He was certain, of course, that not all of them could he the Lord, but the Lord of the universe was one of the three.

ekaù—one; mayä—by me; iha—here; bhagavän—great personality; vividha—various; pradhänaiù—by paraphernalia; citté-kåtaù—fixed in mind; prajananäya—for begetting a child; katham—why; nu—however; yüyam—all of you; atra—here; ägatäù—appeared; tanu-bhåtäm—of the embodied; manasaù—the minds; api—although; dürät—from far beyond; brüta—kindly explain; prasédata—being merciful to me; mahän—very great; iha—this; vismayaù—doubt; me—of mine.

I called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, desiring a son like Him, and I thought of Him only. But although He is far beyond the mental speculation of man, all three of you have come here. Kindly let me know how you have come, for I am greatly bewildered about this.

PURPORT
Atri Muni was confidently aware that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the universe, so he prayed for the one Supreme Lord. He was surprised, therefore, that three of them appeared.

Song-2 Prayers by Demigods to Nara-Narayana Rishi (SB 4.1.56-57)
TEXT 56
devä ücuù
yo mäyayä viracitaà nijayätmanédaà
khe rüpa-bhedam iva tat-praticakñaëäya
etena dharma-sadane åñi-mürtinädya
präduçcakära puruñäya namaù parasmai


deväù—the demigods; ücuù—said; yaù—who; mäyayä—by the external energy; viracitam—was created; nijayä—by His own; ätmani—being situated in Him; idam—this; khe—in the sky; rüpa-bhedam—bunches of clouds; iva—as if; tat—of Himself; praticakñaëäya—for manifesting; etena—with this; dharma-sadane—in the house of Dharma; åñi-mürtinä—with the form of a sage; adya—today; präduçcakära—appeared; puruñäya—unto the Personality of Godhead; namaù—respectful obeisances; parasmai—the Supreme. 
The demigods said: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the transcendental Personality of Godhead, who created as His external energy this cosmic manifestation, which is situated in Him as the air and clouds are situated in space, and who has now appeared in the form of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi in the house of Dharma.

PURPORT
The universal form of the Lord is the cosmic manifestation, which is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In space there are innumerable varieties of planets and also the air, and in the air there are variously colored clouds, and sometimes we see airplanes running from one place to another. Thus the entire cosmic manifestation is full of variety, but actually that variety is a manifestation of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and that energy is situated in Him. Now the Lord Himself, after manifesting His energy, appeared within the creation of His energy, which is simultaneously one with and different from Himself, and therefore the demigods offered their respects to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who manifests Himself in such varieties. There are some philosophers, called nondualists, who because of their impersonal conception think that varieties are false. In this verse it is specifically stated, yo mäyayä viracitam. This indicates that the varieties are a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus because the energy is nondifferent from the Godhead, the varieties are also factual. The material varieties may be temporary, but they are not false. They are a reflection of the spiritual varieties. Here the word praticakñaëäya, "there are varieties," announces the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi and who is the origin of all varieties of material nature.
TEXT 57
so 'yaà sthiti-vyatikaropaçamäya såñöän
sattvena naù sura-gaëän anumeya-tattvaù
dåçyäd adabhra-karuëena vilokanena
yac chré-niketam amalaà kñipatäravindam


saù—that; ayam—He; sthiti—of the created world; vyatikara—calamities; upaçamäya—for destroying; såñöän—created; sattvena—by the mode of goodness; naù—us; sura-gaëän—the demigods; anumeya-tattvaù—understood by the Vedas; dåçyät—glance over; adabhra-karuëena—merciful; vilokanena—glance; yat—which; çré-niketam—the home of the goddess of fortune; amalam—spotless; kñipata—supersedes; aravindam—lotus.

Let that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is understood by truly authorized Vedic literature and who has created peace and prosperity to destroy all calamities of the created world, be kind enough to bestow His glance upon the demigods. His merciful glance can supersede the beauty of the spotless lotus flower which is the home of the goddess of fortune.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of the cosmic manifestation, is covered by the wonderful activities of material nature, just as outer space or the illumination of the sun and moon is sometimes covered by clouds or dust. It is very difficult to find the origin of the cosmic manifestation; therefore material scientists conclude that nature is the ultimate cause of all manifestations. But from çästra, or authentic literature like Bhagavad-gétä and other Vedic scriptures, we understand that behind this wonderful cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in order to maintain the regular procedures of the cosmic manifestation and to be visible to the eyes of persons who are in the mode of goodness, the Lord appears. He is the cause of the creation and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. The demigods therefore prayed for His merciful glance upon them in order to be blessed.

Song-3 Prayers by Brahma to Lord Siva (SB 4.6.42-53)
TEXT 42
brahmoväca
jäne tväm éçaà viçvasya
jagato yoni-béjayoù
çakteù çivasya ca paraà
yat tad brahma nirantaram


brahmä uväca—Lord Brahmä said; jäne—I know; tväm—you (Lord Çiva); éçam—the controller; viçvasya—of the entire material manifestation; jagataù—of the cosmic manifestation; yoni-béjayoù—of both the mother and father; çakteù—of potency; çivasya—of Çiva; ca—and; param—the Supreme; yat—which; tat—that; brahma—without change; nirantaram—with no material qualities.

Lord Brahmä said: My dear Lord Çiva, I know that you are the controller of the entire material manifestation, the combination father and mother of the cosmic manifestation, and the Supreme Brahman beyond the cosmic manifestation as well. I know you in that way.

PURPORT
Although Lord Brahmä had received very respectful obeisances from Lord Çiva, he knew that Lord Çiva was in a more exalted position than himself. Lord Çiva's position is described in Brahma-saàhitä: there is no difference between Lord Viñëu and Lord Çiva in their original positions, but still Lord Çiva is different from Lord Viñëu. The example is given of milk and yogurt: yogurt is not different from the original milk from which it was made.
TEXT 43
tvam eva bhagavann etac
chiva-çaktyoù svarüpayoù
viçvaà såjasi päsy atsi
kréòann ürëa-paöo yathä


tvam—you; eva—certainly; bhagavan—O my lord; etat—this; çiva-çaktyoù—being situated in your auspicious energy; svarüpayoù—by your personal expansion; viçvam—this universe; såjasi—create; päsi—maintain; atsi—annihilate; kréòan—working; ürëa-paöaù—spider's web; yathä—just like.

My dear lord, you create this cosmic manifestation, maintain it, and annihilate it by expansion of your personality, exactly as a spider creates, maintains and winds up its web.

PURPORT
In this verse the word çiva-çakti is significant. Çiva means "auspicious," and çakti means "energy." There are many types of energies of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are auspicious. Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara are called guëa-avatäras, or incarnations of material qualities. In the material world we compare these different incarnations from different angles of vision, but since all of them are expansions of the supreme auspicious, all of them are auspicious, although sometimes we consider one quality of nature to be higher or lower than another. The mode of ignorance, or tamo-guëa, is considered very much lower than the others, but in the higher sense it is also auspicious. The example may be given herein that the government has both an educational department and criminal department. An outsider may consider the criminal department inauspicious, but from the government's point of view it is as important as the education department, and therefore the government finances both departments equally, without discrimination.
TEXT 44
tvam eva dharmärtha-dughäbhipattaye
dakñeëa sütreëa sasarjithädhvaram
tvayaiva loke 'vasitäç ca setavo
yän brähmaëäù çraddadhate dhåta-vratäù


tvam—Your Lordship; eva—certainly; dharma-artha-dugha—benefit derived from religion and economic development; abhipattaye—for their protection; dakñeëa—by Dakña; sütreëa—making him the cause; sasarjitha—created; adhvaram—sacrifices; tvayä—by you; eva—certainly; loke—in this world; avasitäù—regulated; ca—and; setavaù—respect for the varëäçrama institution; yän—which; brähmaëäù—the brähmaëas; çraddadhate—respect very much; dhåta-vratäù—taking it as a vow.

My dear lord, Your Lordship has introduced the system of sacrifices through the agency of Dakña, and thus one may derive the benefits of religious activities and economic development. Under your regulative principles, the institution of the four varëas and äçramas is respected. The brähmaëas therefore vow to follow this system strictly.

PURPORT
The Vedic system of varëa and äçrama is never to be neglected, for these divisions are created by the Supreme Lord Himself for the upkeep of social and religious order in human society. The brähmaëas, as the intelligent class of men in society, must vow to steadily respect this regulative principle. The tendency in this Age of Kali to make a classless society and not observe the principles of varëa and äçrama is a manifestation of an impossible dream. Destruction of the social and spiritual orders will not bring fulfillment of the idea of a classless society. One should strictly observe the principles of varëa and äçrama for the satisfaction of the creator, for it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä by Lord Kåñëa that the four orders of the social system—brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras—are His creation. They should act according to the regulative principles of this institution and satisfy the Lord, just as different parts of the body all engage in the service of the whole. The whole is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His viräö-rüpa, or universal form. The brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras are respectively the mouth, arms, abdomen and legs of the universal form of the Lord. As long as they are engaged in the service of the complete whole, their position is secure, otherwise they fall down from their respective positions and become degraded.
TEXT 45
tvaà karmaëäà maìgala maìgalänäà
kartuù sva-lokaà tanuñe svaù paraà vä
amaìgalänäà ca tamisram ulbaëaà
viparyayaù kena tad eva kasyacit


tvam—Your Lordship; karmaëäm—of the prescribed duties; maìgala—O most auspicious; maìgalänäm—of the auspicious; kartuù—of the performer; sva-lokam—respective higher planetary systems; tanuñe—expand; svaù—heavenly planets; param—transcendental world; vä—or; amaìgalänäm—of the inauspicious; ca—and; tamisram—the name of a particular hell; ulbaëam—ghastly; viparyayaù—the opposite; kena—why; tat eva—certainly that; kasyacit—for someone.

O most auspicious lord, you have ordained the heavenly planets, the spiritual Vaikuëöha planets and the impersonal Brahman sphere as the respective destinations of the performers of auspicious activities. Similarly, for others, who are miscreants, you have destined different kinds of hells which are horrible and ghastly. Yet sometimes it is found that their destinations are just the opposite. It is very difficult to ascertain the cause of this.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that everything is happening. It is said, therefore, that not a blade of grass moves without the supreme will. Generally it is prescribed that performers of pious activities are promoted to the higher planetary systems, devotees are promoted to the Vaikuëöhas, or spiritual worlds, and impersonal speculators are promoted to the impersonal Brahman effulgence; but it sometimes so happens that a miscreant like Ajämila is immediately promoted to the Vaikuëöhaloka simply by chanting the name of Näräyaëa. Although when Ajämila uttered this vibration he intended to call his son Näräyaëa, Lord Näräyaëa took it seriously and immediately gave him promotion to Vaikuëöhaloka, despite his background, which was full of sinful activities. Similarly King Dakña was always engaged in the pious activities of performing sacrifices, yet simply because of creating a little misunderstanding with Lord Çiva, he was severely taken to task. The conclusion is, therefore, that the supreme will is the ultimate judgment; no one can argue against this. A pure devotee therefore submits in all circumstances to the supreme will of the Lord, accepting it as all-auspicious.
tat te 'nukampäà susamékñamäëo
bhuïjäna evätma-kåtaà vipäkam
håd-väg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jéveta yo mukti-pade sa däya-bhäk
(SB 10.14.8)
The purport of this verse is that when a devotee is in a calamitous condition he takes it as a benediction of the Supreme Lord and takes responsibility himself for his past misdeeds. In such a condition, he offers still more devotional service and is not disturbed. One who lives in such a disposition of mind, engaged in devotional service, is the most eligible candidate for promotion to the spiritual world. In other words, such a devotee's claim for promotion to the spiritual world is assured in all circumstances.
TEXT 46
na vai satäà tvac-caraëärpitätmanäà
bhüteñu sarveñv abhipaçyatäà tava
bhütäni cätmany apåthag-didåkñatäà
präyeëa roño 'bhibhaved yathä paçum


na—not; vai—but; satäm—of the devotees; tvat-caraëa-arpita-ätmanäm—of those who are completely surrendered at your lotus feet; bhüteñu—among living entities; sarveñu—all varieties; abhipaçyatäm—perfectly seeing; tava—your; bhütäni—living entities; ca—and; ätmani—in the Supreme; apåthak—nondifferent; didåkñatäm—those who see like that; präyeëa—almost always; roñaù—anger; abhibhavet—takes place; yathä—exactly like; paçum—the animals.

My dear Lord, devotees who have fully dedicated their lives unto your lotus feet certainly observe your presence as Paramätmä in each and every being, and as such they do not differentiate between one living being and another. Such persons treat all living entities equally. They never become overwhelmed by anger like animals, who can see nothing without differentiation.

PURPORT
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes angry or kills a demon, materially this may appear unfavorable, but spiritually it is a blissful blessing upon him. Therefore pure devotees do not make any distinction between the Lord's anger and His blessings. They see both with reference to the Lord's behavior with others and themselves. A devotee does not find fault with the behavior of the Lord in any circumstances.
TEXT 47

tän mävadhéd daiva-vadhän bhavad-vidhaù


påthak—differently; dhiyaù—those who are thinking; karma—fruitive activities; dåçaù—observer; duräçayäù—mean minded; para-udayena—by others' flourishing condition; arpita—given up; håt—heart; rujaù—anger; aniçam—always; parän—others; duruktaiù—harsh words; vitudanti—gives pain; aruntudäù—by piercing words; tän—unto them; mä—not; avadhét—kill; daiva—by providence; vadhän—already killed; bhavat—you; vidhaù—like.

Persons who observe everything with differentiation, who are simply attached to fruitive activities, who are mean minded, who are always pained to see the flourishing condition of others and who thus give distress to them by uttering harsh and piercing words have already been killed by providence. Thus there is no need for them to be killed again by an exalted personality like you.

PURPORT
Persons who are materialistic and always engaged in fruitive activities for material profit cannot endure seeing the flourishing life of others. Except for a few persons in Kåñëa consciousness, the entire world is full of such envious persons, who are perpetually full of anxieties because they are attached to the material body and are without self-realization. Since their hearts are always filled with anxiety, it is understood that they have already been killed by providence. Thus Lord Çiva, as a self-realized Vaiñëava, was advised not to kill Dakña. A Vaiñëava is described as para-duùkha-duùkhé because although he is never distressed in any condition of life, he is distressed to see others in a distressed condition. Vaiñëavas, therefore, should not try to kill by any action of the body or mind, but should try to revive the Kåñëa consciousness of others out of compassion for them. The Kåñëa consciousness movement has been started to deliver the envious persons of the world from the clutches of mäyä, and even though devotees are sometimes put into trouble, they push on the Kåñëa consciousness movement in all tolerance. Lord Caitanya advises:
tåëäd api sunécena
taror api sahiñëunä
amäninä mänadena
kértanéyaù sadä hariù
 [Cc. Ädi 17.31]
"One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly." (Çikñäñöaka 3)
A Vaiñëava should follow the examples of such Vaiñëavas as Haridäsa Öhäkura, Nityänanda Prabhu and also Lord Jesus Christ. There is no need to kill anyone who has already been killed. But it should be noted herewith that a Vaiñëava should not tolerate the blaspheming of Viñëu or Vaiñëavas, although he should tolerate personal insults to himself.
TEXT 48
yasmin yadä puñkara-näbha-mäyayä
durantayä spåñöa-dhiyaù påthag-dåçaù
kurvanti tatra hy anukampayä kåpäà
na sädhavo daiva-balät kåte kramam


yasmin—in some place; yadä—when; puñkara-näbha-mäyayä—by the illusory energy of Puñkaranäbha, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; durantayä—insurmountable; spåñöa-dhiyaù—bewildered; påthak-dåçaù—the same persons who see differently; kurvanti—do; tatra—there; hi—certainly; anukampayä—out of compassion; kåpäm—mercy; na—never; sädhavaù—saintly persons; daiva-balät—by providence; kåte—being done; kramam—prowess.

My dear lord, if in some places materialists, who are already bewildered by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme Godhead, sometimes commit offenses, a saintly person, with compassion, does not take this seriously. Knowing that they commit offenses because they are overpowered by the illusory energy, he does not show his prowess to counteract them.

PURPORT
It is said that the beauty of a tapasvé, or saintly person, is forgiveness. There are many instances in the spiritual history of the world in which many saintly persons, although unnecessarily harassed, did not take action, although they could have done so. Parékñit Mahäräja, for example, was unnecessarily cursed by a brähmaëa boy, and this was very much regretted by the boy's father, but Parékñit Mahäräja accepted the curse and agreed to die within a week as the brähmaëa boy desired. Parékñit Mahäräja was the emperor and was full in power both spiritually and materially, but out of compassion and out of respect for the brähmaëa community, he did not counteract the action of the brähmaëa boy but agreed to die within seven days. Because it was desired by Kåñëa that Parékñit Mahäräja agree to the punishment so that the instruction of Çrémad-Bhägavatam would thus be revealed to the world, Parékñit Mahäräja was advised not to take action. A Vaiñëava is personally tolerant for the benefit of others. When he does not show his prowess, this does not mean that he is lacking in strength; rather, it indicates that he is tolerant for the welfare of the entire human society.
TEXT 49

bhavän—Your Lordship; tu—but; puàsaù—of the person; paramasya—the supreme; mäyayä—by the material energy; durantayä—of great potency; aspåñöa—unaffected; matiù—intelligence; samasta-dåk—seer or knower of everything; tayä—by the same illusory energy; hata-ätmasu—bewildered at heart; anukarma-cetaùsu—whose hearts are attracted by fruitive activities; anugraham—mercy; kartum—to do; iha—in this case; arhasi—desire; prabho—O lord.

My dear lord, you are never bewildered by the formidable influence of the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore you are omniscient and should be merciful and compassionate toward those who are bewildered by the same illusory energy and are very much attached to fruitive activities.

PURPORT
A Vaiñëava is never bewildered by the influence of the external energy because he is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä (7.14):
daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé
mama mäyä duratyayä
mäm eva ye prapadyante
mäyäm etäà taranti te
"My divine energy consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." A Vaiñëava should take care of those who are bewildered by this mäyä instead of becoming angry with them, because without a Vaiñëava's mercy they have no way to get out of the clutches of mäyä. Those who have been condemned by mäyä are rescued by the mercy of devotees.
väïchä-kalpatarubhyaç ca

"I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiñëava devotees of the Lord. They are just like desire trees who can fulfill the desires of everyone, and they are full of compassion for the fallen conditioned souls." Those who are under the influence of the illusory energy are attracted to fruitive activities, but a Vaiñëava preacher attracts their hearts to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa.

PURPORT
A sacrifice is a ceremony performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, First Canto, Second Chapter, it is stated that everyone should try to understand whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by his activity. In other words, the aim of our activities should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as in an office it is the duty of the worker to see that the proprietor or the master is satisfied, so everyone's duty is to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by one's activity. Activities to satisfy the Supreme Godhead are prescribed in the Vedic literature, and execution of such activities is called yajïa. In other words, acting on behalf of the Supreme Lord is called yajïa. One should know very well that any activity besides yajïa is the cause of material bondage. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä (3.9): yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù. Karma-bandhanaù means that if we do not work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, then the reaction of our work will bind us. One should not work for his own sense gratification. Everyone should work for the satisfaction of God. That is called yajïa.
After the yajïa was performed by Dakña, all the demigods expected prasäda, the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Viñëu. Lord Çiva is one of the demigods, so naturally he also expected his share of the prasäda from the yajïa. But Dakña, out of his envy of Lord Çiva, neither invited Çiva to participate in the yajïa nor gave him his share after the offering. But after the destruction of the yajïa arena by the followers of Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä pacified him and assured him that he would get his share of prasäda. Thus he was requested to rectify whatever destruction was caused by his followers.
In Bhagavad-gétä (3.11) it is said that all the demigods are satisfied when one performs yajïa. Because the demigods expect prasäda from yajïas, yajïa must be performed. Those who engage in sense gratificatory, materialistic activities must perform yajïa, otherwise they will be implicated. Thus Dakña, being the father of mankind, was performing yajïa, and Lord Çiva expected his share. But since Çiva was not invited, there was trouble. By the mediation of Lord Brahmä, however, everything was settled satisfactorily.
The performance of yajïa is a very difficult task because all the demigods must be invited to participate in the yajïa. In this Kali-yuga it is not possible to perform such costly sacrifices, nor is it possible to invite the demigods to participate. Therefore in this age it is recommended, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù (SB 11.5.32). Those who are intelligent should know that in the Kali-yuga there is no possibility of performing the Vedic sacrifices. But unless one pleases the demigods, there will be no regulated seasonal activities or rainfall. Everything is controlled by the demigods. Under the circumstances, in this age, in order to keep the balance of social peace and prosperity, all intelligent men should execute the performance of saìkértana-yajïa by chanting the holy names Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. One should invite people, chant Hare Kåñëa, and then distribute prasäda. This yajïa will satisfy all the demigods, and thus there will be peace and prosperity in the world. Another difficulty in performing the Vedic rituals is that if one fails to satisfy even one demigod out of the many hundreds of thousands of demigods, just as Dakña failed to satisfy Lord Çiva, there will be disaster. But in this age the performance of sacrifice has been simplified. One can chant Hare Kåñëa, and by pleasing Kåñëa one can satisfy all the demigods automatically.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Brahmä Satisfies Lord Çiva."

Dakña addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead: My dear Lord, You are transcendental to all speculative positions. You are completely spiritual, devoid of all fear, and You are always in control of the material energy. Even though You appear in the material energy, You are situated transcendentally. You are always free from material contamination because You are completely self-sufficient.

The priests addressed the Lord, saying: O Lord, transcendental to material contamination, by the curse offered by Lord Çiva's men we have become attached to fruitive activities, and thus we are now fallen and therefore do not know anything about You. On the contrary, we are now involved in the injunctions of the three departments of the Vedic knowledge under the plea of executing rituals in the name of yajïa. We know that You have made arrangements for distributing the respective shares of the demigods.

PURPORT
The Vedas are known as trai-guëya-viñayä vedäù (Bg. 2.45). Those who are serious students of the Vedas are very much attached to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas, and therefore these veda-vädés cannot understand that the ultimate goal of the Vedas is to understand Lord Kåñëa, or Viñëu. Those who have transcended the qualitative Vedic attractions, however, can understand Kåñëa, who is never contaminated by the material qualities. Therefore Lord Viñëu is addressed here as anaïjana (free from material contamination). In Bhagavad-gétä (2.42) the crude Vedic scholars have been deprecated by Kåñëa as follows:
yäm imäà puñpitäà väcaà
pravadanty avipaçcitaù
veda-väda-ratäù pärtha
nänyad astéti vädinaù
"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, and they say that there is nothing more than this."

The members of the assembly addressed the Lord: O exclusive shelter for all who are situated in troubled life, in this formidable fort of conditional existence the time element, like a snake, is always looking for an opportunity to strike. This world is full of ditches of so-called distress and happiness, and there are many ferocious animals always ready to attack. The fire of lamentation is always blazing, and the mirage of false happiness is always alluring, but one has no shelter from them. Thus foolish persons live in the cycle of birth and death, always overburdened in discharging their so-called duties, and we do not know when they will accept the shelter of Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
Persons who are not in Kåñëa consciousness are living a very precarious life, as described in this verse, but all these circumstantial conditions are due to forgetfulness of Kåñëa. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is meant to give relief to all these bewildered and distressed persons; therefore it is the greatest relief work for all human society, and the workers thereof are the greatest well-wishers, for they follow in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, who is the greatest friend to all living entities.

Lord Çiva said: My dear Lord, my mind and consciousness are always fixed on Your lotus feet, which, as the source of all benediction and the fulfillment of all desires, are worshiped by all liberated great sages because Your lotus feet are worthy of worship. With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am no longer disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my activities are not purified. I do not mind their accusations, and I excuse them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion toward all living entities.

PURPORT
Lord Çiva expresses herein his regret at having been angry and having disturbed the sacrificial activities of Dakña. King Dakña had insulted him in many ways, and thus he had become angry and had frustrated the entire sacrificial ceremony. Later, when he was pleased, the yajïa performances were reinstituted, and therefore he regretted his activities. Now he says that because his mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, he is no longer disturbed by the ordinary critics of his way of life. From this statement by Lord Çiva it is understood that as long as one is on the material platform one is affected by the three modes of material nature. As soon as one is in Kåñëa consciousness, however, one is no longer affected by such material activities. One should therefore always be fixed in Kåñëa consciousness, busy in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. It is guaranteed that such a devotee will never be affected by the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. This fact is also corroborated in Bhagavad-gétä: anyone who is fixed in the transcendental service of the Lord has surpassed all the material qualities and is situated in the status of Brahman realization, in which one is not afflicted by hankering for material objects. The recommendation of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is that one should always be Kåñëa conscious and should never forget his transcendental relationship with the Lord. This program has to be followed strictly by everyone. From the statement of Lord Çiva it is understood that he was always in Kåñëa consciousness, and thus he remained free from material affliction. The only remedy, therefore, is to continue Kåñëa consciousness rigidly, in order to get out of the contamination of the material modes.

Çré Bhågu said: My dear Lord, all living entities, beginning from the highest, namely Lord Brahmä, down to the ordinary ant, are under the influence of the insurmountable spell of illusory energy, and thus they are ignorant of their constitutional position. Everyone believes in the concept of the body, and all are thus submerged in the darkness of illusion. They are actually unable to understand how You live in every living entity as the Supersoul, nor can they understand Your absolute position. But You are the eternal friend and protector of all surrendered souls. Therefore, please be kind toward us and forgive all our offenses.

PURPORT
Bhågu Muni was conscious of the scandalous behavior exhibited by each and every one of them, including Brahmä and Lord Çiva, in the sacrificial ceremony of Dakña. By mentioning Brahmä, the chief of all living entities within this material world, he wanted to state that everyone, including also Brahmä and Lord Çiva, is under the concept of the body and under the spell of material energy—all but Viñëu. That is the version of Bhågu. As long as one is under the concept of the body as self, it is very difficult to understand the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Conscious that he was not greater than Brahmä, Bhågu included himself in the list of offenders. Ignorant personalities, or conditioned souls, have no choice but to accept their precarious condition under material nature. The only remedy is to surrender to Viñëu and always pray to be excused. One should depend only on the causeless mercy of the Lord for deliverance and not even slightly on one's own strength. That is the perfect position of a Kåñëa conscious person. The Lord is everyone's friend, but He is especially friendly to the surrendered soul. The simple process, therefore, is that a conditioned soul should remain surrendered to the Lord, and the Lord will give him all protection to keep him out of the clutches of material contamination.

brahmä uväca—Lord Brahmä said; na—not; etat—this; svarüpam—eternal form; bhavataù—Your; asau—that other; pada-artha—knowledge; bheda—different; grahaiù—by the acquiring; puruñaù—person; yävat—as long as; ékñet—wants to see; jïänasya—of knowledge; ca—also; arthasya—of the objective; guëasya—of the instruments of knowledge; ca—also; äçrayaù—the basis; mäyä-mayät—from being made of material energy; vyatiriktaù—distinct; mataù—regarded; tvam—You.

Lord Brahmä said: My dear Lord, Your personality and eternal form cannot be understood by any person who is trying to know You through the different processes of acquiring knowledge. Your position is always transcendental to the material creation, whereas the empiric attempt to understand You is material, as are its objectives and instruments.

PURPORT
It is said that the transcendental name, qualities, activities, paraphernalia, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood with our material senses. The attempt of the empiric philosophers to understand the Absolute Truth by speculation is always futile because their process of understanding, their objective and the instruments by which they try to understand the Absolute Truth are all material. The Lord is apräkåta, beyond the creation of the material world. This fact is also accepted by the great impersonalist Çaìkaräcärya: näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktäd aëòam avyakta-sambhavam. Avyakta, or the original material cause, is beyond this material manifestation and is the cause of the material world. Because Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material world, one cannot speculate upon Him by any material method. One has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by the transcendental method of Kåñëa consciousness. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (18.55). Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti: only by devotional service can one understand the transcendental form of the Lord. The difference between the impersonalists and the personalists is that the impersonalists, limited by their speculative processes, cannot even approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the devotees please the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His transcendental loving service. Sevonmukhe hi: due to the service attitude of the devotee, the Lord is revealed to him. The Supreme Lord cannot be understood by materialistic persons even though He is present before them. In Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa therefore condemns such materialists as müòhas. Müòha means "rascal." It is said in the Gétä, "Only rascals think of Lord Kåñëa as an ordinary person. They do not know what Lord Kåñëa's position is or what His transcendental potencies are." Unaware of His transcendental potencies, the impersonalists deride the person of Lord Kåñëa, whereas the devotees, by dint of their service attitude, can understand Him as the Personality of Godhead. In the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Arjuna also confirmed that it is very difficult to understand the personality of the Lord.

indraù uväca—King Indra said; idam—this; api—certainly; acyuta—O infallible one; viçva-bhävanam—for the welfare of the universe; vapuù—transcendental form; änanda-karam—a cause of pleasure; manaù-dåçäm—to the mind and the eye; sura-vidviö—envious of Your devotees; kñapaëaiù—by punishment; ud-äyudhaiù—with uplifted weapons; bhuja-daëòaiù—with arms; upapannam—possessed of; añöabhiù—with eight.

King Indra said: My dear Lord, Your transcendental form with eight hands and weapons in each of them appears for the welfare of the entire universe, and it is very pleasing to the mind and eyes. In such a form, Your Lordship is always prepared to punish the demons, who are envious of Your devotees.

PURPORT
It is generally understood from revealed scriptures that Lord Viñëu appears with four hands, but in this particular sacrificial arena Lord Viñëu arrived with eight hands. King Indra said, "Even though we are accustomed to see Your four-handed Viñëu form, this appearance with eight hands is as real as the four-handed form." As Lord Brahmä had said, to realize the transcendental form of the Lord is beyond the power of the senses. In reply to that statement by Brahmä, King Indra said that even though the transcendental form of the Lord is not perceivable by the material senses, His activities and His transcendental form can be understood. The Lord's uncommon features, uncommon activities and uncommon beauty can be perceived even by an ordinary man. For example, when Lord Kåñëa appeared just like a six- or seven-year-old boy in Våndävana, He was approached by the residents there. There were torrents of rain, and the Lord saved the residents of Våndävana by lifting Govardhana Hill and resting it on the little finger of His left hand for seven days. This uncommon feature of the Lord should convince even materialistic persons who want to speculate to the limit of their material senses. The activities of the Lord are pleasing to experimental vision also, but impersonalists will not believe in His identity because they study the personality of the Lord by comparing their personality to His. Because men in this material world cannot lift a hill, they do not believe that the Lord can lift one. They accept the statements of Çrémad-Bhägavatam to be allegorical, and they try to interpret them in their own way. But factually the Lord lifted the hill in the presence of all the inhabitants of Våndävana, as corroborated by great äcäryas and authors like Vyäsadeva and Närada. Everything about the Lord—His activities, pastimes and uncommon features—should be accepted as is, and in this way, even in our present condition, we can understand the Lord. In the instance herein, King Indra confirmed: "Your presence with eight hands is as good as Your presence with four hands." There is no doubt about it.

The wives of the performers of the sacrifice said: My dear Lord, this sacrifice was arranged under the instruction of Brahmä, but unfortunately Lord Çiva, being angry at Dakña, devastated the entire scene, and because of his anger the animals meant for sacrifice are lying dead. Therefore the preparations of the yajïa have been lost. Now, by the glance of Your lotus eyes, the sanctity of this sacrificial arena may be again invoked.

PURPORT
Animals were offered in sacrifice in order to give them renewed life; that was the purpose of having animals there. Offering an animal in sacrifice and giving him renewed life was the evidence of the strength of chanting mantras. Unfortunately, when Dakña's sacrifice was devastated by Lord Çiva, some of the animals were killed. (One was killed just to replace the head of Dakña.) Their bodies were lying about, and the sacrificial arena was turned into a crematorium. Thus the real purpose of yajïa was lost.
Lord Viñëu, being the ultimate objective of such sacrificial ceremonies, was requested by the wives of the priests to glance over the yajïa arena with His causeless mercy so that the routine work of the yajïa might be continued. The purport here is that animals should not be unnecessarily killed. They were used to prove the strength of the mantras and were to have been rejuvenated by the use of the mantras. They should not have been killed, as they were by Lord Çiva to replace the head of Dakña with an animal's head. It was pleasing to see an animal sacrificed and rejuvenated, and that pleasing atmosphere had been lost. The wives of the priests requested that the animals be brought back to life by the glance of Lord Viñëu to make a pleasing yajïa.

The sages prayed: Dear Lord, Your activities are most wonderful, and although You do everything by Your different potencies, You are not at all attached to such activities. You are not even attached to the goddess of fortune, who is worshiped by the great demigods like Brahmä, who pray to achieve her mercy.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the Lord has no desire to achieve any result from His wonderful activities, nor has He any need to perform them. But still, in order to give an example to people in general, He sometimes acts, and those activities are very wonderful. He is not attached to anything. Na mäà karmäëi limpanti: although He acts very wonderfully, He is not at all attached to anything (Bg. 4.14). He is self-sufficient. The example is given here that the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, is always engaged in the service of the Lord, but still He is not attached to her. Even great demigods like Brahmä worship the goddess of fortune in order to win her favor, but although the Lord is worshiped by many hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune, He is not at all attached to any one of them. This distinction concerning the exalted transcendental position of the Lord is specifically mentioned by the great sages; He is not like the ordinary living entity, who is attached to the results of pious activities.

The Siddhas prayed: Like an elephant that has suffered in a forest fire but can forget all its troubles by entering a river, our minds, O Lord, always merge in the nectarean river of Your transcendental pastimes, and they desire never to leave such transcendental bliss, which is as good as the pleasure of merging in the Absolute.

PURPORT
This statement is from the Siddhas, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka, where the eight kinds of material perfection are complete. The residents of Siddhaloka have full control in the eight kinds of yogic perfection, but from their statement it appears that they are pure devotees. They always merge in the nectarean river of hearing of the pastimes of the Lord. Hearing of the pastimes of the Lord is called kåñëa-kathä. Similarly, there is a statement by Prahläda Mahäräja that those who are always merged in the ocean of the nectar of describing the Lord's pastimes are liberated and have no fear of the material condition of life. The Siddhas say that the mind of an ordinary person is full of anxieties. The example is given of the elephant who has suffered in a forest fire and who enters into a river for relief. If persons who are suffering in the forest fire of this material existence will only enter into the nectarean river of the description of the pastimes of the Lord, they will forget all the troubles of the miserable material existence. The Siddhas do not care for fruitive activities, such as performing sacrifices and achieving the good results. They simply merge in the transcendental discussions of the pastimes of the Lord. That makes them completely happy, without care for pious or impious activities. For those who are always in Kåñëa consciousness there is no need to perform any kind of pious or impious sacrifices or activities. Kåñëa consciousness is itself complete, for it includes all the processes praised in the Vedic scriptures.

yajamäné—the wife of Dakña; uväca—prayed; su-ägatam—auspicious appearance; te—Your; praséda—become pleased; éça—my dear Lord; tubhyam—unto You; namaù—respectful obeisances; çréniväsa—O abode of the goddess of fortune; çriyä—with Lakñmé; käntayä—Your wife; trähi—protect; naù—us; tväm—You; åte—without; adhéça—O supreme controller; na—not; aìgaiù—with bodily limbs; makhaù—the sacrificial arena; çobhate—is beautiful; çérña-hénaù—without the head; ka-bandhaù—possessed of only a body; yathä—as; puruñaù—a person.

The wife of Dakña prayed as follows: My dear Lord, it is very fortunate that You have appeared in this arena of sacrifice. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, and I request that You be pleased on this occasion. The sacrificial arena is not beautiful without You, just as a body is not beautiful without the head.

PURPORT
Another name of Lord Viñëu is Yajïeçvara. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that all activities should be performed as Viñëu-yajïa, for the pleasure of Lord Viñëu. Unless we please Him, whatever we do is the cause of our bondage in the material world. This is confirmed herein by the wife of Dakña: "Without Your presence, the grandeur of this sacrificial ceremony is useless, just as a body without the head, however decorated it may be, is useless." The comparison is equally applicable to the social body. Material civilization is very proud of being advanced, but it is actually the useless trunk of a body without a head. Without Kåñëa consciousness, without an understanding of Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, any advancement in a civilization, no matter how sophisticated, is of no value. There is a statement in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (3.11):
bhagavad-bhakti-hénasya
jätiù çästraà japas tapaù
apräëasyaiva dehasya
maëòanaà loka-raïjanam
The purport is that sometimes when a friend or relative dies, especially among lower class men, the dead body is decorated. Dressed and ornamented, the body is taken in procession. That sort of decoration of the dead body has no actual value because the life force is already gone. Similarly, any aristocracy, any social prestige or any advancement of material civilization without Kåñëa consciousness is as good as the decoration of a dead body. The name of the wife of Dakña was Prasüti, and she was the daughter of Sväyambhuva Manu. Her sister, Devahüti, was married to Kardama Muni, and Kapiladeva, the Personality of Godhead, became her son. Prasüti, then, was the aunt of Lord Viñëu. She was asking the favor of Lord Viñëu in an affectionate mode; since she was His aunt, she sought some special favor. Also significant in this verse is that the Lord is praised with the goddess of fortune. Wherever Lord Viñëu is worshiped, naturally there is the favor of the goddess of fortune. Lord Viñëu is addressed as amåta, transcendental. The demigods, including Brahmä and Lord Çiva, were produced after the creation, but Lord Viñëu existed before the creation. He is addressed, therefore, as amåta. Lord Viñëu is worshiped with His internal energy by the Vaiñëavas. Prasüti, the wife of Dakña, implored the Lord to turn the priests into Vaiñëavas instead of simply fruitive workers performing sacrifices for some material benefits.

The governors of various planets spoke as follows: Dear Lord, we believe only in our direct perception, but under the circumstances we do not know whether we have actually seen You with our material senses. By our material senses we can simply perceive the cosmic manifestation, but You are beyond the five elements. You are the sixth. We see You, therefore, as a creation of the material world.

PURPORT
The governors of the various planets are certainly materially opulent and very puffed up. Such persons are unable to understand the transcendental, eternal form of the Lord. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that only persons who have anointed their eyes with love of Godhead can see the Personality of Godhead in every step of their activities. Also, in the prayers of Kunté (SB 1.8.26) it is stated that only those who are akiïcana-gocaram, who are not materially puffed up, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead; others are bewildered and cannot even think of the Absolute Truth.

The great mystics said: Dear Lord, persons who see You as nondifferent from themselves, knowing that You are the Supersoul of all living entities, are certainly very, very dear to You. You are very favorable toward those who engage in devotional service, accepting You as the Lord and themselves as the servants. By Your mercy, You are always inclined in their favor.

PURPORT
It is indicated in this verse that the monists and the great mystics know the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one. This oneness is not the misunderstanding that a living entity is equal in every respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This monism is based on pure knowledge as described and confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (7.17): priyo hi jïänino 'tyartham ahaà sa ca mama priyaù. The Lord says that those who are advanced in transcendental knowledge and know the science of Kåñëa consciousness are very dear to Him, and He also is very dear to them. Those who are actually in perfect knowledge of the science of God know that the living entities are superior energy of the Supreme Lord. This is stated in Bhagavad-gétä, Seventh Chapter: the material energy is inferior, and the living entities are superior energy. Energy and the energetic are nondifferent; therefore, energies possess the same quality as the energetic. Persons who are in full knowledge of the Personality of Godhead, analyzing His different energies and knowing their own constitutional position, are certainly very, very dear to the Lord. Persons, however, who may not even be conversant with knowledge of the Supreme Personality but who always think of the Lord with love and faith, feeling that He is great and that they are His parts and parcels, ever His servitors, are even more favored by Him. The particular significance of this verse is that the Lord is addressed as vatsala. Vatsala means "always favorably disposed." The Lord's name is bhakta-vatsala. The Lord is famous as bhakta-vatsala, which means that He is always favorably inclined to the devotees, whereas He is never addressed anywhere in the Vedic literature as jïäné-vatsala.

jagat—the material world; udbhava—creation; sthiti—maintenance; layeñu—in annihilation; daivataù—destiny; bahu—many; bhidyamäna—being variegated; guëayä—by material qualities; ätma-mäyayä—by His material energy; racita—produced; ätma—in the living entities; bheda-mataye—who produced different inclinations; sva-saàsthayä—by His internal potency; vinivartita—caused to stop; bhrama—interaction; guëa—of material modes; ätmane—unto Him in His personal form; namaù—obeisances.

We offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who has created varieties of manifestations and put them under the spell of the three qualities of the material world in order to create, maintain and annihilate them. He Himself is not under the control of the external energy; in His personal feature He is completely devoid of the variegated manifestation of material qualities, and He is under no illusion of false identification.

PURPORT
Two situations are described in this verse. One is the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world, and the other is the Lord's own establishment. There is also quality in the Lord's own establishment, the kingdom of God. It is stated here that Goloka is His personal situation. There is also quality in Goloka, but that quality is not divided into creation, maintenance and annihilation. In the external energy, the interaction of the three qualities makes it possible for things to be created, maintained and annihilated. But in the spiritual world, or the kingdom of God, there is no such exhibition, since everything is eternal, sentient and blissful. There is a class of philosophers who misunderstand the appearance of the Personality of Godhead within this material world. They are under the impression that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He is under the spell of the three qualities, like all the other living entities who appear within this material world. That is their misunderstanding; as it is clearly stated here (sva-saàsthayä), by His internal potency He is transcendental to all these material qualities. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says, "I appear by My internal potency." Both the internal and external potencies are under the control of the Supreme, so He does not come under the control of either of these potencies. Rather, everything is under His control. In order to manifest His transcendental name, form, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia, He brings into action His internal energy. On account of the variegatedness of the external potency, there are manifestations of many qualitative demigods, beginning with Brahmä and Lord Çiva, and people are attracted to these demigods according to their own material quality. But when one is transcendental or surpasses the material qualities, he is simply fixed in the worship of the Supreme Personality. This fact is explained in Bhagavad-gétä: anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is already transcendental to the variegatedness and interaction of the three material qualities. The summary is that the conditioned souls are being pulled by the action and reaction of the material qualities, which create a differentiation of energies. But in the spiritual world the worshipable one is the Supreme Lord and no one else.

brahma—the personified Vedas; uväca—said; namaù—respectful obeisances; te—unto You; çrita-sattväya—the shelter of the quality of goodness; dharma-ädénäm—of all religion, austerity and penance; ca—and; sütaye—the source; nirguëäya—transcendental to material qualities; ca—and; yat—of whom (of the Supreme Lord); käñöhäm—the situation; na—not; aham—I; veda—know; apare—others; api—certainly; ca—and.

The personified Vedas said: We offer our respectful obeisances unto You, the Lord, the shelter of the quality of goodness and therefore the source of all religion, austerity and penance, for You are transcendental to all material qualities and no one knows You or Your actual situation.

PURPORT
In the material world there is the trinity of the three material qualities. Lord Viñëu has accepted the superintendence of the quality of goodness, which is the source of religion, knowledge, austerity, renunciation, opulence, etc. Because of this, actual peace, prosperity, knowledge and religion can be attained when the living entities are under the control of the quality of goodness in the material world. As soon as they are subjected to the control of the other two qualities, namely passion and ignorance, their precarious conditional life becomes intolerable. But Lord Viñëu, in His original position, is always nirguëa, which means transcendental to these material qualities. Guëa means "quality," and nir means "negation." This does not indicate, however, that He has no qualities; He has transcendental qualities by which He appears and manifests His pastimes. The positive transcendental qualitative manifestation is unknown to the students of the Vedas as well as to the great stalwart demigods like Brahmä and Çiva. Actually, the transcendental qualities are manifested only to the devotees. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, simply by discharging devotional service one can understand the transcendental position of the Supreme Lord. Those who are in the mode of goodness can partially enter into the transcendental understanding, but it is advised in Bhagavad-gétä that one has to surpass this. The Vedic principles are based on the three qualities of the material modes. One has to transcend the three qualities, and then one can be situated in pure and simple spiritual life.

The fire-god said: My dear Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because by Your favor I am as luminous as blazing fire and I accept the offerings mixed with butter and offered in sacrifice. The five kinds of offerings according to the Yajur Veda are all Your different energies, and You are worshiped by five kinds of Vedic hymns. Sacrifice means Your Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly said that yajïa should be performed for Lord Viñëu. Lord Viñëu has one thousand popular, transcendental names, out of which one name is Yajïa. It is clearly said that everything should be done for the satisfaction of Yajïa, or Viñëu. All other actions a person may take are only causes for his bondage. Everyone has to perform yajïa according to the Vedic hymns. As stated in the Upaniñads, fire, the altar, the auspicious full moon, the period of four months called cäturmäsya, the sacrificial animal, and the beverage called soma are necessary requisites, as are the specific hymns mentioned in the Vedas and composed of four letters. One hymn is as follows: äçrävayeti catur-akñaraà astu çrauñaò iti catur-akñaraà yajeti dväbhyäà ye yajämahaù. These mantras, chanted according to the çruti and småti literatures, are only to please Lord Viñëu. For the deliverance of those who are materially conditioned and attached to material enjoyment, performing yajïa and following the rules and regulations of the four divisions of society and of spiritual life are recommended. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa that by offering sacrifice to Viñëu one can gradually be liberated. The whole target of life, therefore, is to please Lord Viñëu. That is yajïa. Any person who is in Kåñëa consciousness has dedicated his life for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, the origin of all Viñëu forms, and by offering worship and prasäda daily, he becomes the best performer of yajïa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is clearly stated that in this Age of Kali the only successful performance of yajïa, or sacrifice, is yajïaiù saìkértana-präyaiù: the best type of sacrifice is simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This yajïa is offered before the form of Lord Caitanya, as other yajïas are offered before the form of Lord Viñëu. These recommendations are found in the Eleventh Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Moreover, this yajïa performance confirms that Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Viñëu Himself. As Lord Viñëu appeared at the Dakña yajïa long, long ago, Lord Caitanya has appeared in this age to accept our saìkértana-yajïa.

deväù—the demigods; ücuù—said; purä—formerly; kalpa-apäye—at the devastation of the kalpa; sva-kåtam—self-produced; udaré-kåtya—having drawn within Your abdomen; vikåtam—effect; tvam—You; eva—certainly; ädyaù—original; tasmin—in that; salile—water; uraga-indra—on Çeña; adhiçayane—on the bed; pumän—personality; çeñe—taking rest; siddhaiù—by the liberated souls (like Sanaka, etc.); hådi—in the heart; vimåçita—meditated on; adhyätma-padaviù—the path of philosophical speculation; saù—He; eva—certainly; adya—now; akñëoù—of both eyes; yaù—who; pathi—on the path; carasi—You move; bhåtyän—servants; avasi—protect; naù—us.

The demigods said: Dear Lord, formerly, when there was a devastation, You conserved all the different energies of material manifestation. At that time, all the inhabitants of the higher planets, represented by such liberated souls as Sanaka, were meditating on You by philosophical speculation. You are therefore the original person, and You rest in the water of devastation on the bed of the Çeña snake. Now, today, You are visible to us, who are all Your servants. Please give us protection.

PURPORT
The devastation indicated in this verse is the partial devastation of the lower planets within the universe when Lord Brahmä goes to sleep. The higher planetary systems, beginning with Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, are not inundated at the time of this devastation. The Lord is the creator, as indicated in this verse, because the energies of creation are manifested through His body, and after annihilation, He conserves all the energy within His abdomen.
Another significant point in this verse is that the demigods said, "We are all Your servants (bhåtyän). Give us Your protection." The demigods depend on the protection of Viñëu; they are not independent. Bhagavad-gétä, therefore, condemns the worship of demigods because there is no need of it and clearly states that only those who have lost their sense go asking favors of the demigods. Generally, if anyone has material desires to be fulfilled, he can ask Viñëu instead of going to the demigods. Those who worship demigods are not very intelligent. Besides that, the demigods say, "We are Your eternal servants." So those who are servants or devotees of the Lord are not very much concerned with fruitive activities, the performance of the prescribed yajïas, or mental speculation. They simply serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead sincerely, with love and faith, performing everything with that loving service, and the Lord gives such devotees direct protection. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says, "Simply surrender unto Me, and I will give you protection from all the reactions of sinful activities." This material world is so created that one has to act sinfully, knowingly or unknowingly, and unless his life is dedicated to Viñëu, he has to suffer all the reactions of sinful activities. But one who surrenders and dedicates his life for the service of the Lord has direct protection from the Lord. He has no fear of suffering from sinful activities, nor does he desire, willingly or unwillingly, to do anything which is sinful.

The Gandharvas said: Dear Lord, all the demigods, including Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä, Indra and Maréci and the great sages, are all only differentiated parts and parcels of Your body. You are the Supreme Almighty Great; the whole creation is just like a plaything for You. We always accept You as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There may be many gods, from Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Indra and Candra down to the rulers of the lower planetary systems, the presidents, ministers, chairmen and kings. In fact, anyone can think that he is God. That is the false, puffed-up conviction of material life. Actually Viñëu is the Supreme Lord, but there is even one above Viñëu, for Viñëu is also the plenary portion of a part of Kåñëa. In this verse this is referred to by the word aàçäàçäù, which refers to part and parcel of a part and parcel. There are similar verses in the Caitanya-caritämåta which indicate that the Supreme Lord's parts and parcels again expand into other parts and parcels. As described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, there are many manifestations of Viñëu and many manifestations of living entities. Viñëu manifestations are called sväàça, partial manifestations, and the living entities are called vibhinnäàça. The demigods like Brahmä and Indra have been promoted to such exalted positions by pious activities and austerities, but actually Viñëu, or Kåñëa, is the master of everyone. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya [Cc. Ädi 5.142]. This means that Kåñëa alone is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that all others, even the viñëu-tattva and certainly the living entities, are His servitors. Baladeva is the immediate expansion of Kåñëa. He also engages in the service of Kåñëa, and certainly the ordinary living entities are serving. Everyone is created, constitutionally, for serving Kåñëa. Here the Gandharvas acknowledge that although the demigods may represent themselves as the Supreme, actually they are not supreme. Real supremacy belongs to Kåñëa. Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28] is the statement of Çrémad-Bhägavatam: "Kåñëa is the only Supreme Lord." Worship of Kåñëa alone, therefore, includes worship of all the parts and parcels, just as watering the root of a tree also waters all the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers.

vidyädharäù—the Vidyädharas; ücuù—said; tvat-mäyayä—by Your external potency; artham—the human body; abhipadya—after obtaining; kalevare—in the body; asmin—in this; kåtvä—having misidentified; mama—mine; aham—I; iti—thus; durmatiù—the ignorant person; utpathaiù—by wrong roads; svaiù—by one's own belongings; kñiptaù—distracted; api—even; asat—temporary; viñaya-lälasaù—having his happiness in sense objects; ätma-moham—the illusion of the body as the self; yuñmat—Your; kathä—topics; amåta—nectar; niñevakaù—relishing; ut—from a long distance; vyudasyet—can be delivered.

The Vidyädharas said: Dear Lord, this human form of body is meant for attaining the highest perfectional objective, but, impelled by Your external energy, the living entity misidentifies himself with his body and with the material energy, and therefore, influenced by mäyä, he wants to become happy by material enjoyment. He is misled and always attracted by temporary, illusory happiness. But Your transcendental activities are so powerful that if one engages in the hearing and chanting of such topics, he can be delivered from illusion.

PURPORT
The human form of life is called arthada because the body can very nicely help the embodied soul to achieve the highest perfection. Prahläda Mahäräja said that even though temporary, the body can give us the highest perfectional achievement. In the process of evolution from the lower to the higher grade of living, the human form of life is a great boon. But mäyä is so strong that in spite of achieving this great boon of the human form of life, we are influenced by temporary material happiness, and we forget our goal of life. We are attracted by things which will cease to exist. The beginning of such attraction is the temporary body. In this horrible condition of life there is only one way of liberation—to engage in the activities of transcendental chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The words yuñmat-kathämåta-niñevakaù mean "those who engage in relishing the nectar of the topics of Your Lordship." There are two narrative books which especially concern the words and activities of Kåñëa. Bhagavad-gétä is the instruction given by Kåñëa, and Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the book containing topics exclusively about Kåñëa and His devotees. These two books are the special nectar of the words of Kåñëa. For those who engage in the preaching of these two Vedic literatures it is very easy to get out of the illusory conditional life imposed upon us by mäyä. The illusion is that the conditioned soul does not try to understand his spiritual identity. He is more interested in his external body, which is only a flash and which will be finished as soon as the time is designated. The whole atmosphere will change when the living entity has to transmigrate from one body to another. Under the spell of mäyä, he will again be satisfied in a different atmosphere. This spell of mäyä is called ävaraëätmikä çakti because it is so strong that the living entity is satisfied in any abominable condition. Even if he is born as a worm living within the intestine or abdomen in the midst of urine and stool, still he is satisfied. This is the covering influence of mäyä. But the human form of life is a chance to understand, and if one misses this opportunity, he is most unfortunate. The way to get out of illusory mäyä is to engage in the topics of Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya advocated a process whereby everyone may remain in his present position without change but simply hear from the proper authoritative sources about Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya advised everyone to spread the word of Kåñëa. He advised, "All of you become spiritual masters. Your duty is simply to talk to whomever you meet of Kåñëa or of the instructions given by Kåñëa." The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is operating for this purpose. We do not ask anyone to first change his position and then come to us. Instead, we invite everyone to come with us and simply chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, because we know that if one simply chants and hears the topics of Kåñëa, one's life will change; he will see a new light, and his life will be successful.

brähmaëäù—the brähmaëas; ücuù—said; tvam—You; kratuù—sacrifice; tvam—You; haviù—offering of clarified butter; tvam—You; huta-äçaù—fire; svayam—personified; tvam—You; hi—for; mantraù—the Vedic hymns; samit-darbha-päträëi—the fuel, the kuça grass and the sacrificial pots; ca—and; tvam—You; sadasya—the members of the assembly; åtvijaù—the priests; dampaté—the chief person of the sacrifice and his wife; devatä—demigods; agni-hotram—the sacred fire ceremony; svadhä—the offering to the forefathers; somaù—the soma plant; äjyam—the clarified butter; paçuù—the sacrificial animal.

The brähmaëas said: Dear Lord, You are sacrifice personified. You are the offering of clarified butter, You are the fire, You are the chanting of Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the fuel, You are the flame, You are the kuça grass, and You are the sacrificial pots. You are the priests who perform the yajïa, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.

PURPORT
In this statement Lord Viñëu's all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa that as a fire situated in one place emanates its heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within the material or spiritual worlds is nothing but a manifestation of different energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brähmaëas' statement is that Lord Viñëu is everything—the fire, the offering, the clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the kuça. He is everything. It is confirmed herein that the performance of saìkértana-yajïa in this age is as good as all other yajïas in all other ages. If one performs saìkértana-yajïa by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, there is no need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for the prescribed sacrificial ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. In the chant of the holy names, Hare and Kåñëa, Hare means the energy of Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the viñëu-tattva. Combined together they are everything. In this age, persons are harassed by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the requisite paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as recommended in the Vedas. But if one simply chants Hare Kåñëa, it is to be understood that he is performing all kinds of yajïa because there is nothing within our vision except Hare (the energy of Kåñëa) and Kåñëa. There is no difference between Kåñëa and His energies. Thus since everything is a manifestation of His energy, it is to be understood that everything is Kåñëa. One simply has to accept everything in Kåñëa consciousness, and he is a liberated person. One should not misunderstand that because everything is Kåñëa, Kåñëa has no personal identity. Kåñëa is so full that in spite of keeping Himself separate from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä, Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as everything, but still He is not everything. The philosophy recommended by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one and different.

tvam—You; purä—in the past; gäm—the earth; rasäyäù—from within the water; mahä-sükaraù—the great boar incarnation; daàñörayä—with Your tusk; padminém—a lotus; väraëa-indraù—an elephant; yathä—as; stüyamänaù—being offered prayers; nadan—vibrating; lélayä—very easily; yogibhiù—by great sages like Sanaka, etc.; vyujjahartha—picked up; trayé-gätra—O personified Vedic knowledge; yajïa-kratuù—having the form of sacrifice.

Dear Lord, O personified Vedic knowledge, in the past millennium, long, long ago, when You appeared as the great boar incarnation, You picked up the world from the water, as an elephant picks up a lotus flower from a lake. When You vibrated transcendental sound in that gigantic form of a boar, the sound was accepted as a sacrificial hymn, and great sages like Sanaka meditated upon it and offered prayers for Your glorification.

PURPORT
A significant word used in this verse is trayé-gätra, which means that the transcendental form of the Lord is the Vedas. Anyone who engages in the worship of the Deity, or the form of the Lord in the temple, is understood to be studying all the Vedas twenty-four hours a day. Simply by decorating the Deities of the Lord, Rädhä and Kåñëa, in the temple, one very minutely studies the injunctions of the Vedas. Even a neophyte devotee who simply engages in the worship of the Deity is understood to be in direct touch with the purport of Vedic knowledge. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: the purport of the Vedas is to understand Him, Kåñëa. One who worships and serves Kåñëa directly has understood the truths of the Vedas.

saù—that same person; praséda—be pleased; tvam—You; asmäkam—upon us; äkäìkñatäm—awaiting; darçanam—audience; te—Your; paribhrañöa—fallen down; sat-karmaëäm—of whom the performance of sacrifice; kértyamäne—being chanted; nåbhiù—by persons; nämni—Your holy name; yajïa-éça—O Lord of sacrifice; te—Your; yajïa-vighnäù—obstacles; kñayam—destruction; yänti—attain; tasmai—unto You; namaù—respectful obeisances.

Dear Lord, we were awaiting Your audience because we have been unable to perform the yajïas according to the Vedic rituals. We pray unto You, therefore, to be pleased with us. Simply by chanting Your holy name, one can surpass all obstacles. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You in Your presence.

PURPORT
The brähmaëa priests were very hopeful that their sacrifice would be carried out without obstacles now that Lord Viñëu was present. It is significant in this verse that the brähmaëas say, "Simply by chanting Your holy name we can surpass the obstacles, but now You are personally present." The performance of yajïa by Dakña was obstructed by the disciples and followers of Lord Çiva. The brähmaëas indirectly criticized the followers of Lord Çiva, but because the brähmaëas were always protected by Lord Viñëu, Çiva's followers could not do any harm to their prosecution of the sacrificial process. There is a saying that when Kåñëa protects someone, no one can do him harm, and when Kåñëa wants to kill someone, no one can protect him. The vivid example was Rävaëa. Rävaëa was a great devotee of Lord Çiva, but when Lord Rämacandra wanted to kill him, Lord Çiva could not protect him. If some demigod, even Lord Çiva or Lord Brahmä, wants to do harm to a devotee, Kåñëa protects the devotee. But when Kåñëa wants to kill someone, such as Rävaëa or Hiraëyakaçipu, no demigod can protect him.

dhruvaù uväca—Dhruva Mahäräja said; yaù—the Supreme Lord who; antaù—within; praviçya—entering; mama—my; väcam—words; imäm—all these; prasuptäm—which are all inactive or dead; saïjévayati—rejuvenates; akhila—universal; çakti—energy; dharaù—possessing; sva-dhämnä—by His internal potency; anyän ca—other limbs also; hasta—like hands; caraëa—legs; çravaëa—ears; tvak—skin; ädén—and so on; präëän—life force; namaù—let me offer my obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; puruñäya—the Supreme Person; tubhyam—unto You.

Dhruva Mahäräja said: My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After entering within me, You have enlivened all my sleeping senses—my hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
Dhruva Mahäräja could understand very easily the difference between his condition before and after attaining spiritual realization and seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He could understand that his life force and activities had been sleeping. Unless one comes to the spiritual platform, his bodily limbs, mind and other facilities within the body are understood to be sleeping. Unless one is spiritually situated, all his activities are taken as a dead man's activities or ghostly activities. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has composed a song in which he addresses himself: "O living entity, get up! How long shall you sleep on the lap of mäyä? Now you have the opportunity of possessing a human form of body; now try to get up and realize yourself." The Vedas also declare, "Get up! Get up! You have the opportunity, the boon of the human form of life—now realize yourself." These are the Vedic injunctions.
Dhruva Mahäräja actually experienced that upon enlightenment of his senses on the spiritual platform he could understand the essence of Vedic instruction—that the Supreme Godhead is the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal. Dhruva Mahäräja could immediately understand this fact. He was aware that for a very long time he was practically sleeping, and he felt the impetus to glorify the Lord according to the Vedic conclusion. A mundane person cannot offer any prayer or glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because he has no realization of the Vedic conclusion.
When Dhruva Mahäräja, therefore, found this difference within himself, he could immediately understand that it was because of the causeless mercy of the Lord. He offered obeisances to the Lord with great respect and reverence, completely understanding that the Lord's favor was upon him. This spiritual enlivenment of Dhruva Mahäräja's senses and mind was due to the action of the internal potency of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, the word sva-dhämnä means "by spiritual energy." Spiritual enlightenment is possible by the mercy of the spiritual energy of the Lord. The chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra is first addressed to the spiritual energy of the Lord, Hare. This spiritual energy acts when a living entity fully surrenders and accepts his position as an eternal servitor. When a person places himself at the disposal or order of the Supreme Lord, that is called sevonmukha; at that time the spiritual energy gradually reveals the Lord to him.
Without revelation by the spiritual energy, one is unable to offer prayers glorifying the Lord. Any amount of philosophical speculation or poetic expression by mundane persons is still considered to be the action and reaction of the material energy. When one is actually enlivened by the spiritual energy, all his senses become purified, and he engages only in the service of the Lord. At that time his hands, legs, ears, tongue, mind, genitals—everything—engage in the service of the Lord. Such an enlightened devotee no longer has any material activities, nor has he any interest in being materially engaged. This process of purifying the senses and engaging them in the service of the Lord is known as bhakti, or devotional service. In the beginning, the senses are engaged by the direction of the spiritual master and çästra, and after realization, when the same senses are purified, the engagement continues. The difference is that in the beginning the senses are engaged in a mechanical way but after realization they are engaged in spiritual understanding.
TEXT 7
ekas tvam eva bhagavann idam ätma-çaktyä
mäyäkhyayoru-guëayä mahad-ädy-açeñam

ekaù—one; tvam—you; eva—certainly; bhagavan—O my Lord; idam—this material world; ätma-çaktyä—by Your own potency; mäyä-äkhyayä—of the name mäyä; uru—greatly powerful; guëayä—consisting of the modes of nature; mahat-ädi—the mahat-tattva, etc.; açeñam—unlimited; såñövä—after creating; anuviçya—then after entering; puruñaù—the Supersoul; tat—of mäyä; asat-guëeñu—into the temporarily manifested qualities; nänä—variously; iva—as if; däruñu—into pieces of wood; vibhävasu-vat—just like fire; vibhäsi—You appear.

My Lord, You are the supreme one, but by Your different energies You appear differently in the spiritual and material worlds. You create the total energy of the material world by Your external potency, and after creation You enter within the material world as the Supersoul. You are the Supreme Person, and through the temporary modes of material nature You create varieties of manifestation, just as fire, entering into wood of different shapes, burns brilliantly in different varieties.

PURPORT
Dhruva Mahäräja realized that the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, acts through His different energies, not that He becomes void or impersonal and thus becomes all-pervading. The Mäyävädé philosopher thinks that the Absolute Truth, being spread throughout the cosmic manifestation, has no personal form. But here Dhruva Mahäräja, upon realization of the Vedic conclusion, says, "You are spread all over the cosmic manifestation by Your energy." This energy is basically spiritual, but because it acts in the material world temporarily, it is called mäyä, or illusory energy. In other words, for everyone but the devotees the Lord's energy acts as external energy. Dhruva Mahäräja could understand this fact very nicely, and he could understand also that the energy and the energetic are one and the same. The energy cannot be separated from the energetic.
The identity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the feature of Paramätmä, or Supersoul, is admitted herein. His original, spiritual energy enlivens the material energy, and thus the dead body appears to have life force. Voidist philosophers think that under certain material conditions the symptoms of life occur in the material body, but the fact is that the material body cannot act on its own. Even a machine needs separate energy (electricity, steam, etc.). It is stated in this verse that the material energy acts in varieties of material bodies, just as fire burns differently in different wood according to the size and quality of the wood. In the case of devotees the same energy is transformed into spiritual energy; this is possible because the energy is originally spiritual, not material. As it is said, viñëu-çaktiù parä proktä [Cc. Madhya 6.154]. The original energy inspires a devotee, and thus he engages all his bodily limbs in the service of the Lord. The same energy, as external potency, engages the ordinary nondevotees in material activities for sense enjoyment. We should mark the difference between mäyä and sva-dhämna, the Lord's spiritual energy—for devotees the sva-dhämna acts, whereas in the case of nondevotees the mäyä energy acts.
TEXT 8
tvad-dattayä vayunayedam acañöa viçvaà

tvat-dattayä—given by You; vayunayä—by knowledge; idam—this; acañöa—could see; viçvam—whole universe; supta-prabuddhaù—a man rising from sleep; iva—like; nätha—O my Lord; bhavat-prapannaù—Lord Brahmä, who is surrendered unto You; tasya—his; äpavargya—of persons desiring liberation; çaraëam—the shelter; tava—Your; päda-mülam—lotus feet; vismaryate—can be forgotten; kåta-vidä—by a learned person; katham—how; ärta-bandho—O friend of the distressed.

O my master, Lord Brahmä is fully surrendered unto You. In the beginning You gave him knowledge, and thus he could see and understand the entire universe, just as a person awakens from sleep and visualizes his immediate duties. You are the only shelter of all persons who desire liberation, and You are the friend of all who are distressed. How, therefore, can a learned person who has perfect knowledge ever forget You?

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be forgotten even for a moment by His surrendered devotees. The devotee understands that the Lord's causeless mercy is beyond his estimation; he cannot know how much he is benefited by the grace of the Lord. The more a devotee engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, the more encouragement is supplied by the energy of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that to those who are constantly engaged in devotional service with love and affection, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives intelligence from within, and thus they may make further progress. Being so encouraged, the devotee can never forget, at any moment, the Personality of Godhead. He always feels obliged to Him for having achieved increased power in devotional service by His grace. Saintly persons like Sanaka, Sanätana and Lord Brahmä were able to see the entire universe, by the mercy of the Lord, through knowledge of the Lord. The example is given that a person may apparently abstain from sleep all day but as long as he is not spiritually enlightened he is actually sleeping. He may sleep at night and perform his duties in the daytime, but as long as he does not come to the platform of working in spiritual enlightenment he is considered to be always sleeping. A devotee, therefore, never forgets the benefit derived from the Lord.
The Lord is addressed here as ärta-bandhu, which means "friend of the distressed." As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, after many, many births of executing severe austerities in search of knowledge, one comes to the point of real knowledge and becomes wise when one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mäyävädé philosopher, who does not surrender unto the Supreme Person, is understood to be lacking in real knowledge. The devotee in perfect knowledge cannot forget his obligation to the Lord at any moment.
TEXT 9

nünam—certainly; vimuñöa-matayaù—those who have lost their right intelligence; tava—Your; mäyayä—by the influence of the illusory energy; te—they; ye—who; tväm—You; bhava—from birth; apyaya—and death; vimokñaëam—the cause of liberation; anya-hetoù—for other purposes; arcanti—worship; kalpaka-tarum—who are like the desire tree; kuëapa—of this dead body; upabhogyam—sense gratification; icchanti—they desire; yat—that which; sparça-jam—derived by touch sensation; niraye—in hell; api—even; nèëäm—for persons.

Persons who worship You simply for the sense gratification of this bag of skin are certainly influenced by Your illusory energy. In spite of having You, who are like a desire tree and are the cause of liberation from birth and death, foolish persons, such as me, desire benedictions from You for sense gratification, which is available even for those who live in hellish conditions.

PURPORT
Dhruva Mahäräja repented because he had come to the Lord to render devotional service for material profit. He here condemns his attitude. Only due to gross lack of knowledge does one worship the Lord for material profit or for sense gratification. The Lord is like a desire tree. Anyone can have whatever he desires from the Lord, but people in general do not know what kind of benediction they should ask from Him. Happiness derived from the touch of skin, or sensuous happiness, is present in the life of hogs and dogs. Such happiness is very insignificant. If a devotee worships the Lord for such insignificant happiness, he must be considered devoid of all knowledge.
TEXT 10
yä nirvåtis tanu-bhåtäà tava päda-padma-

yä—that which; nirvåtiù—bliss; tanu-bhåtäm—of the embodied; tava—Your; päda-padma—lotus feet; dhyänät—from meditating upon; bhavat-jana—from Your intimate devotees; kathä—topics; çravaëena—by hearing; vä—or; syät—comes into being; sä—that bliss; brahmaëi—in the impersonal Brahman; sva-mahimani—Your own magnificence; api—even; nätha—O Lord; mä—never; bhüt—exists; kim—what to speak of; tu—then; antaka-asi—by the sword of death; lulität—being destroyed; patatäm—of those who fall down; vimänät—from their airplanes.

My Lord, the transcendental bliss derived from meditating upon Your lotus feet or hearing about Your glories from pure devotees is so unlimited that it is far beyond the stage of brahmänanda, wherein one thinks himself merged in the impersonal Brahman as one with the Supreme. Since brahmänanda is also defeated by the transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, then what to speak of the temporary blissfulness of elevating oneself to the heavenly planets, which is ended by the separating sword of time? Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, he falls down in due course of time.

PURPORT
The transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, primarily from çravaëaà kértanam [SB 7.5.23], hearing and chanting, cannot be compared to the happiness derived by karmés by elevating themselves to the heavenly planets or by jïänés or yogés, who enjoy oneness with the supreme impersonal Brahman. Yogés generally meditate upon the transcendental form of Viñëu, but devotees not only meditate upon Him but actually engage in the direct service of the Lord. In the previous verse we find the phrase bhaväpyaya, which refers to birth and death. The Lord can give relief from the chain of birth and death. It is a misunderstanding to think, as do the monists, that when one gets relief from the process of birth and death he merges into the Supreme Brahman. Here it is clearly said that the transcendental bliss derived from çravaëaà kértanam by pure devotees cannot be compared to brahmänanda, or the impersonal conception of transcendental bliss derived by merging into the Absolute.
The position of karmés is still more degraded. Their aim is to elevate themselves to the higher planetary systems. It is said, yänti deva-vratä devän: persons who worship the demigods are elevated to the heavenly planets (Bg. 9.25). But elsewhere in Bhagavad-gétä (9.21) we find, kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti: those who are elevated to the higher planetary systems must come down again as soon as the results of their pious activities are exhausted. They are like the modern astronauts who go to the moon; as soon as their fuel is used up, they are obliged to come back down to this earth. As the modern astronauts who go to the moon or other heavenly planets by force of jet propulsion have to come down again after exhausting their fuel, so also do those who are elevated to the heavenly planets by force of yajïas and pious activities. Antakäsi-lulität: by the sword of time one is cut from his exalted position within this material world, and he comes down again. Dhruva Mahäräja appreciated that the results of devotional service are far more valuable than merging into the Absolute or being elevated to the heavenly planets. The words patatäà vimänät are very significant. Vimäna means "airplane." Those who are elevated to the heavenly planets are like airplanes, which drop when they run out of fuel.

bhaktim—devotional service; muhuù—constantly; pravahatäm—of those who perform; tvayi—unto You; me—my; prasaìgaù—intimate association; bhüyät—may it become; ananta—O unlimited; mahatäm—of the great devotees; amala-äçayänäm—whose hearts are freed from material contamination; yena—by which; aïjasä—easily; ulbaëam—terrible; uru—great; vyasanam—full of dangers; bhava-abdhim—the ocean of material existence; neñye—I shall cross; bhavat—Your; guëa—transcendental qualities; kathä—pastimes; amåta—nectar, eternal; päna—by drinking; mattaù—mad.

Dhruva Mahäräja continued: O unlimited Lord, kindly bless me so that I may associate with great devotees who engage in Your transcendental loving service constantly, as the waves of a river constantly flow. Such transcendental devotees are completely situated in an uncontaminated state of life. By the process of devotional service I shall surely be able to cross the nescient ocean of material existence, which is filled with the waves of blazing, firelike dangers. It will be very easy for me, for I am becoming mad to hear about Your transcendental qualities and pastimes, which are eternally existent.

PURPORT
The significant point in Dhruva Mahäräja's statement is that he wanted the association of pure devotees. Transcendental devotional service cannot be complete and cannot be relishable without the association of devotees. We have therefore established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Anyone who is trying to be aloof from this Krishna Consciousness Society and yet engage in Kåñëa consciousness is living in a great hallucination, for this is not possible. From this statement by Dhruva Mahäräja it is clear that unless one is associated with devotees, his devotional service does not mature; it does not become distinct from material activities. The Lord says, satäà prasaìgän mama vérya-saàvido bhavanti håt-karëa-rasäyanäù (SB 3.25.25). Only in the association of pure devotees can the words of Lord Kåñëa be fully potent and relishable to the heart and ear. Dhruva Mahäräja explicitly wanted the association of devotees. That association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna Consciousness Society we have full engagement twenty-four hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service.
A Mäyävädé philosopher may question us, "You may be very happy in the association of devotees, but what is your plan for crossing the ocean of material existence?" Dhruva Mahäräja's answer is that it is not very difficult. He clearly says that this ocean can be crossed very easily if one simply becomes mad to hear the glories of the Lord. Bhavad-guëa-kathä: for anyone who persistently engages in hearing the topics of the Lord from Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä, Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Caitanya-caritämåta and who is actually addicted to this process, just as one becomes addicted to intoxicants, it is very easy to cross the nescience of material existence. The ocean of material nescience is compared to a blazing fire, but to a devotee this blazing fire is insignificant because he is completely absorbed in devotional service. Although the material world is blazing fire, to a devotee it appears full of pleasure (viçvaà pürëa-sukhäyate).
The purport of this statement by Dhruva Mahäräja is that devotional service in the association of devotees is the cause of the development of further devotional service. By devotional service only is one elevated to the transcendental planet Goloka Våndävana, and there also there is only devotional service, for the activities of devotional service both in this world and in the spiritual world are one and the same. Devotional service does not change. The example of a mango can be given here. If one gets an unripe mango, it is still a mango, and when it is ripe it remains the same mango, but it has become more tasteful and relishable. Similarly, there is devotional service performed according to the direction of the spiritual master and the injunctions and regulative principles of çästra, and there is devotional service in the spiritual world, rendered directly in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are both the same. There is no change. The difference is that one stage is unripe and the other is ripe and more relishable. It is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees.

O Lord who have a lotus navel, if a person happens to associate with a devotee whose heart always hankers after Your lotus feet, seeking always their fragrance, he is never attached to the material body or, in a bodily relationship, to offspring, friends, home, wealth and wife, which are very, very dear to materialistic persons. Indeed, he does not care for them.

PURPORT
A special advantage in devotional service is that devotees not only enjoy the transcendental pastimes of the Lord by hearing and chanting and glorifying them, but also are not very much attached to their bodies, unlike the yogés, who are too attached to the body and who think that by performing bodily gymnastic exercises they will advance in spiritual consciousness. Yogés are generally not very much interested in devotional service; they want to regulate the breathing process. This is simply a bodily concern. Here Dhruva Mahäräja plainly says that a devotee has no more bodily interest. He knows that he is not the body. From the very beginning, therefore, without wasting time in bodily exercises, a devotee searches out a pure devotee and simply by his association becomes more advanced in spiritual consciousness than any yogé. Because a devotee knows that he is not the body, he is never affected by bodily happiness or distress. He is not interested in bodily relationships with wife, children, home, bank balance, etc., or in the distress and happiness which come from these things. This is the special advantage of being a devotee. This status of life is possible only when a person is interested in associating with a pure devotee, who always enjoys the fragrance of the lotus feet of the Lord.

My dear Lord, O Supreme Unborn, I know that the different varieties of living entities, such as animals, trees, birds, reptiles, demigods and human beings, are spread throughout the universe, which is caused by the total material energy, and I know that they are sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest; but I have never experienced the supreme form I behold as I see You now. Now all kinds of methods of theorizing have come to an end.

PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that He has spread Himself throughout the universe but although everything is resting upon Him He is aloof. The same concept is expressed here by Dhruva Mahäräja. He states that before seeing the transcendental form of the Lord he had experienced only the varieties of material forms, which are counted at 8,400,000 species of aquatics, birds, beasts, etc. The fact is that unless one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, it is impossible to understand the ultimate form of the Lord. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä (18.55). Bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti: factual understanding of the Absolute Truth, who is the Supreme Person, cannot be obtained by any process other than devotional service.
Dhruva Mahäräja here compares his previous state of understanding with the perfection of understanding in the presence of the Supreme Lord. The position of a living entity is to render service; unless he comes to the stage of appreciating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he engages in the service of the various forms of trees, reptiles, animals, Men, demigods, etc. One can experience that one man engages in the service of a dog, another serves plants and creepers, another the demigods, and another humanity, or his boss in the office—but no one is engaged in the service of Kåñëa. Aside from common men, even men who are elevated in terms of spiritual understanding are at the utmost engaged in the service of the viräö-rüpa, or, unable to understand the ultimate form of the Lord, they worship voidism by meditation. Dhruva Mahäräja, however, had been blessed by the Supreme Lord. When the Lord touched His conchshell to Dhruva's forehead, real knowledge was revealed from within, and Dhruva could understand the Lord's transcendental form. Dhruva Mahäräja here admits that not only was he ignorant but by years he was only a child. It would not have been possible for an ignorant child to appreciate the supreme form of the Lord had he not been blessed by the Lord, who had touched His conchshell to Dhruva's forehead.

My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium the Supreme Personality of Godhead Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu dissolves everything manifested within the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Çeña Näga, from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord Brahmä is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
Dhruva Mahäräja's understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is complete. In the Vedas it is said, kasmin nu bhagavo vijïäte sarvam idaà vijïätaà bhavatéti (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.3): knowledge received through the transcendental, causeless mercy of the Lord is so perfect that by that knowledge the devotee becomes acquainted with all the different manifestations of the Lord. Lord Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu was present before Dhruva Mahäräja, who could also understand the Lord's two other forms, namely Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Käraëodakaçäyé (Mahä) Viñëu. Regarding Mahä-Viñëu, it is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.48):
yasyaika-niçvasita-kälam athävalambya
jévanti loma-vilajä jagad-aëòa-näthäù
viñëur mahän sa iha yasya kalä-viçeño
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
At the end of each and every millennium, when all the material worlds are dissolved, everything enters the body of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is lying on the lap of Çeña Näga, another form of the Lord.
Those who are not devotees cannot understand the different forms of Viñëu and their positions in regard to the creation. Sometimes the atheists argue, "How can a flower stem sprout from the navel of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu?" They consider all the statements of the çästras to be stories. As a result of their inexperience in the Absolute Truth and their reluctance to accept authority, they become more and more atheistic; they cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But a devotee like Dhruva Mahäräja, by the grace of the Lord, knows all the manifestations of the Lord and their different positions. It is said that anyone who has even a little of the Lord's grace can understand His glories; others may go on speculating on the Absolute Truth, but they will always be unable to understand the Lord. In other words, unless one comes in contact with a devotee it is not possible to understand the transcendental form or the spiritual world and its transcendental activities.

My Lord, by Your unbroken transcendental glance You are the supreme witness of all stages of intellectual activities. You are eternally liberated, Your existence is situated in pure goodness, and You are existent in the Supersoul without change. You are the original Personality of Godhead, full with six opulences, and You are eternally the master of the three modes of material nature. Thus, You are always different from the ordinary living entities. As Lord Viñëu, You maintain all the affairs of the entire universe, and yet You stand aloof and are the enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices.

PURPORT
An atheistic argument against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead states that if God, the Supreme Person, appears and disappears and sleeps and awakens, then what is the difference between God and the living entity? Dhruva Mahäräja is carefully distinguishing the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from that of the living entities. He points out the following differences. The Lord is eternally liberated. Whenever He appears, even within this material world, He is never entangled by the three modes of material nature. He is known, therefore, as try-adhéça, the master of the three modes of material nature. In Bhagavad-gétä (7.14) it is said, daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé mama mäyä duratyayä: the living entities are all entangled in the three modes of material nature. The external energy of the Lord is very strong, but the Lord, as the master of the three modes of material nature, is ever liberated from the action and reaction of those modes. He, therefore, is uncontaminated, as stated in the Éçopaniñad. The contamination of the material world does not affect the Supreme Godhead. Kåñëa therefore says in the Bhagavad-gétä that those who are rascals and fools think of Him as an ordinary human being, not knowing His paraà bhävam. Paraà bhävam refers to His being always transcendentally situated. Material contamination cannot affect Him.
Another difference between the Lord and the living entity is that a living entity is always in darkness. Even though he may be situated in the mode of goodness, there are still so many things which are unknown to him. But it is not the same for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knows past, present and future and everything that is happening in everyone's heart. Bhagavad-gétä confirms this (vedähaà samatétäni [Bg. 7.26]). The Lord is not part of the soul—He is the unchangeable Supreme Soul, and the living entities are His parts and parcels. The living entity is forced to appear in this material world under the direction of daiva-mäyä, but when the Lord appears, He comes by His own internal potency, ätma-mäyä. Besides that, a living entity is within the time of past, present and future. His life has a beginning, a birth, and in the conditioned state his life ends with death. But the Lord is ädi-puruña, the original person. In the Brahma-saàhitä Lord Brahmä offers his respect to the ädi-puruña, Govinda, the original person, who has no beginning, whereas the creation of this material world has a beginning. The Vedänta says, janmädy asya yataù; [SB 1.1.1] everything is born from the Supreme, but the Supreme has no birth. He has all the six opulences in full and beyond comparison, He is the master of material nature, His intelligence is not broken under any circumstances, and He stands aloof, although He is the maintainer of the whole creation. As stated in the Vedas (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13), nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm. The Lord is the supreme maintainer. Living entities are meant to serve Him by offering sacrifices, for He is the rightful enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices. Everyone, therefore, should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord with his life, his riches, his intelligence and his words. This is the original, constitutional position of the living entities. One should never compare the sleeping of an ordinary living entity to the sleeping of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Causal Ocean. There is no stage at which the living entity can compare to the Supreme Person. The Mäyävädé philosophers, being unable to adjust to all this, come to the conclusion of impersonalism or voidism.

yasmin viruddha-gatayo hy aniçaà patanti

yasmin—in whom; viruddha-gatayaù—of opposite character; hi—certainly; aniçam—always; patanti—are manifest; vidyä-ädayaù—knowledge and ignorance, etc.; vividha—various; çaktayaù—energies; änupürvyät—continually; tat—that; brahma—Brahman; viçva-bhavam—the cause of material creation; ekam—one; anantam—unlimited; ädyam—original; änanda-mätram—simply blissful; avikäram—changeless; aham—I; prapadye—offer my obeisances.

My dear Lord, in Your impersonal manifestation of Brahman there are always two opposing elements—knowledge and ignorance. Your multienergies are continually manifest, but the impersonal Brahman, which is undivided, original, changeless, unlimited and blissful, is the cause of the material manifestation. Because You are the same impersonal Brahman, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that the unlimited impersonal Brahman is the effulgence of the transcendental body of Govinda. In that unlimited effulgent aura of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there are innumerable universes with innumerable planets of different categories. Although the Supreme Person is the original cause of all causes, His impersonal effulgence, known as Brahman, is the immediate cause of the material manifestation. Dhruva Mahäräja, therefore, offered his respectful obeisances unto the impersonal feature of the Lord. One who realizes this impersonal feature can enjoy the unchangeable brahmänanda, described here as spiritual bliss.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura describes that this impersonal feature, or Brahman manifestation, of the Supreme Lord is meant for persons who are essentially very advanced but still not able to understand the personal features or variegatedness of the spiritual world. Such devotees are known as jïäna-miçra-bhaktas, or devotees whose devotional service is mixed with empiric knowledge. Because the impersonal Brahman realization is a partial understanding of the Absolute Truth, Dhruva Mahäräja offers his respectful obeisances.
It is said that this impersonal Brahman is the distant realization of the Absolute Truth. Although apparently Brahman seems to be devoid of energy, factually it has different energies working under the headings of knowledge and ignorance. On account of these different energies, there is continually a manifestation of vidyä and avidyä. Vidyä and avidyä are very nicely described in Éçopaniñad. It is said there that sometimes, due to avidyä, or a poor fund of knowledge, one accepts the Absolute Truth as ultimately impersonal. But in fact the impersonal and personal realizations develop in proportion to the development of devotional service. The more we develop our devotional service, the more closely we approach the Absolute Truth, which, in the beginning, when we realize the Absolute Truth from a distant place, is manifest as impersonal.
People in general, who are under the influence of avidyä-çakti, or mäyä, have neither knowledge nor devotion. But when a person who is a little advanced and is therefore called a jïäné advances even more, he is in the category of a jïäna-miçra-bhakta, or a devotee whose love is mixed with empiric knowledge. When he is still further advanced, he can realize that the Absolute Truth is a person with multienergies. An advanced devotee can understand the Lord and His creative energy. As soon as one accepts the creative energy of the Absolute Truth, the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are also understood. Devotees who are still further advanced, in full knowledge, can understand the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Only on that platform can one fully enjoy transcendental bliss. An example is given in this connection by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura of a person proceeding towards a destination. As he approaches, he sees the destination from a distant place, just as we see a city from a distance. At that time he simply understands that the city is situated at a distance. When, however, he comes still nearer, he sees the domes and flags. But as soon as he enters the city, he sees various paths, gardens, lakes, and marketplaces with shops, and persons buying. He sees varieties of cinema houses, and he sees dancing and jubilation. When a person actually enters the city and personally sees the activities of the city, he becomes satisfied.

satya—real; äçiñaù—compared with other benedictions; hi—certainly; bhagavan—my Lord; tava—Your; päda-padmam—lotus feet; äçéù—benediction; tathä—in that way; anubhajataù—for the devotees; puruña-artha—of the real goal of life; mürteù—the personification; api—although; evam—thus; arya—O Lord; bhagavän—the Personality of Godhead; paripäti—maintains; dénän—the poor in heart; väçrä—a cow; iva—like; vatsakam—unto the calf; anugraha—to bestow mercy; kätaraù—eager; asmän—upon me.

My Lord, O Supreme Lord, You are the supreme personified form of all benediction. Therefore, for one who abides in Your devotional service with no other desire, worshiping Your lotus feet is better than becoming king and lording it over a kingdom. That is the benediction of worshiping Your lotus feet. To ignorant devotees like me, You are the causelessly merciful maintainer, just like a cow, who takes care of the newly born calf by supplying milk and giving it protection from attack.

PURPORT
Dhruva Mahäräja was cognizant of the defective nature of his own devotional service. Pure devotional service is without material form and is not covered by mental speculation or fruitive activities. Pure devotional service is therefore called ahaituké, unmotivated. Dhruva Mahäräja knew that he had come to worship the Lord in devotional service with a motive—to get the kingdom of his father. Such an adulterated devotee can never see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He therefore felt very grateful for the causeless mercy of the Lord. The Lord is so merciful that not only does He fulfill the desires of a devotee who is driven by ignorance and desires for material benefit, but He also gives such a devotee all protection, just as a cow gives milk to a newly born calf. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the Lord gives intelligence to the constantly engaged devotee so that he may gradually approach the Lord without difficulty. A devotee must be very sincere in his devotional service; then, although there may be many things wrong on the devotee's part, Kåñëa will guide him and gradually elevate him to the highest position of devotional service.
The Lord is addressed herein by Dhruva Mahäräja as puruñärtha-mürti, the ultimate goal of life. Generally puruñärtha is taken to mean execution of a type of religious principle or worship of God in order to get material benediction. Prayers for material benediction are intended for satisfying the senses. And when one is frustrated and cannot fully satisfy the senses in spite of all endeavor, he desires liberation, or freedom from material existence. These activities are generally called puruñärtha. But actually the ultimate goal is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called païcama-puruñärtha, the ultimate goal of life. Lord Caitanya therefore taught us not to ask from the Supreme Personality any benediction such as material wealth, popularity or a good wife. One should simply pray to the Lord to be constantly engaged in His transcendental loving service. Dhruva Mahäräja, being cognizant of his desire for material benefit, wanted protection from the Lord so that he might not be misled or deviated from the path of devotional service by material desires.

dharä—the planet earth; uväca—said; namaù—I offer my obeisances; parasmai—unto the Transcendence; puruñäya—unto the person; mäyayä—by the material energy; vinyasta—expanded; nänä—various; tanave—whose forms; guëa-ätmane—unto the source of the three modes of material nature; namaù—I offer my obeisances; svarüpa—of the real form; anubhavena—by understanding; nirdhuta—not affected by; dravya—matter; kriyä—action; käraka—doer; vibhrama—bewilderment; ürmaye—the waves of material existence.

The planet earth spoke: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are transcendental in Your position, and by Your material energy You have expanded Yourself in various forms and species of life through the interaction of the three modes of material nature. Unlike some other masters, You always remain in Your transcendental position and are not affected by the material creation, which is subject to different material interactions. Consequently You are not bewildered by material activities.

PURPORT
After King Påthu gave his royal command, the planet earth in the shape of a cow could understand that the king was a directly empowered incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the king knew everything—past, present and future. Thus there was no possibility of the earth's cheating him. The earth was accused of hiding the seeds of all herbs and grains, and therefore she is preparing to explain how the seeds of these herbs and grains can be again exposed. The earth knew that the king was very angry with her, and she realized that unless she pacified his anger, there was no possibility of placing a positive program before him. Therefore in the beginning of her speech she very humbly presents herself as a part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's body. She submits that the various bodily forms manifest in the physical world are but different parts and parcels of the supreme gigantic body. It is said that the lower planetary systems are parts and parcels of the legs of the Lord, whereas the upper planetary systems are parts and parcels of the Lord's head. The Lord creates this material world by His external energy, but this external energy is in one sense not different from Him. Yet at the same time the Lord is not directly manifest in the external energy but is always situated in the spiritual energy. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (9.10), mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù: material nature is working under the direction of the Lord. Therefore the Lord is not unattached to the external energy, and He is addressed in this verse as guëa-ätmä, the source of the three modes of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (13.15), nirguëaà guëa-bhoktå ca: although the Lord is not attached to the external energy, He is nonetheless the master of it. The philosophy of Lord Caitanya, upholding that the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from His creation (acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva), is very easily understandable in this connection. The planet earth explains that although the Lord is attached to the external energy, He is nirdhuta; He is completely free from the activities of the external energy. The Lord is always situated in His internal energy. Therefore in this verse it is stated: svarüpa-anubhavena. The Lord remains completely in His internal potency and yet has full knowledge of the external energy as well as the internal energy, just as His devotee remains always in a transcendental position, keeping himself in the service of the Lord without becoming attached to the material body. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé says that the devotee who is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is always liberated, regardless of his material situation. If it is possible for a devotee to remain transcendental, it is certainly possible for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to remain in His internal potency without being attached to the external potency. There should be no difficulty in understanding this situation. Just as a devotee is never bewildered by his material body, the Lord is never bewildered by the external energy of this material world. A devotee is not hampered by the material body, although he is situated in a physical body that runs according to so many material conditions, just as there are five kinds of air functioning within the body, and so many organs—the hands, legs, tongue, genitals, rectum, etc.—all working differently. The spirit soul, the living entity, who is in full knowledge of his position is always engaged in chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and is not concerned with the bodily functions. Although the Lord is connected with the material world, He is always situated in His spiritual energy and is always unattached to the functions of the material world. As far as the material body is concerned, there are six "waves," or symptomatic material conditions: hunger, thirst, lamentation, bewilderment, old age and death. The liberated soul is never concerned with these six physical interactions. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being the all-powerful master of all energies, has some connection with the external energy, but He is always free from the interactions of the external energy in the material world.

The planet earth continued: My dear Lord, You are the complete conductor of the material creation. You have created this cosmic manifestation and the three material qualities, and therefore You have created me, the planet earth, the resting place of all living entities. Yet You are always fully independent, my Lord. Now that You are present before me and ready to kill me with Your weapons, let me know where I should go to take shelter, and tell me who can give me protection.

PURPORT
The planet earth herein exhibits the symptoms of full surrender before the Lord. As stated, no one can protect the person whom Kåñëa is prepared to kill, and no one can kill the person whom Kåñëa protects. Because the Lord was prepared to kill the planet earth, there was no one to give protection to her. We are all receiving protection from the Lord, and it is therefore proper that every one of us surrender unto Him. In Bhagavad-gétä (18.66) the Lord instructs:
sarva-dharmän parityajya
mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja
ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo
mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear."
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura sings: "My dear Lord, whatever I have—even my mind, the center of all material necessities, namely my home, my body and whatever I have in connection with this body—I now surrender unto You. You are now completely independent to act however You like. If You like, You can kill me, and if You like, You can save me. In any case, I am Your eternal servant, and You have every right to do whatever You like."

In the beginning of creation You created all these moving and nonmoving living entities by Your inconceivable energy. Through this very same energy You are now prepared to protect the living entities. Indeed, You are the supreme protector of religious principles. Why are You so anxious to kill me, even though I am in the form of a cow?

PURPORT
The planet earth argues that there is no doubt that one who creates can also annihilate by his sweet will. The planet earth questions why she should be killed when the Lord is prepared to give protection to everyone. After all, it is the earth that is the resting place for all other living entities, and it is the earth that produces grains for them.

nünam—surely; bata—certainly; éçasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; saméhitam—activities, plan; janaiù—by people; tat-mäyayä—by His potency; durjayayä—which is unconquerable; akåta-ätmabhiù—who are not sufficiently experienced; na—never; lakñyate—are seen; yaù—he who; tu—then; akarot—created; akärayat—caused to create; yaù—one who; anekaù—many; ekaù—one; parataù—by His inconceivable potencies; ca—and; éçvaraù—controller.

My dear Lord, although You are one, by Your inconceivable potencies You have expanded Yourself in many forms. Through the agency of Brahmä, You have created this universe. You are therefore directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are not sufficiently experienced cannot understand Your transcendental activities because these persons are covered by Your illusory energy.

PURPORT
God is one, but He expands Himself in a variety of energies—the material energy, the spiritual energy, the marginal energy and so forth. Unless one is favored and especially endowed with grace, he cannot understand how the one Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His different energies. The living entities are also the marginal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahmä is also one of these living entities, but he is especially empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Brahmä is supposed to be the creator of this universe, actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is its ultimate creator. In this verse the word mäyayä is significant. Mäyä means "energy." Lord Brahmä is not the energetic but is one of the manifestations of the Lord's marginal energy. In other words, Lord Brahmä is only an instrument. Although sometimes plans appear contradictory, there is a definite plan behind all action. One who is experienced and is favored by the Lord can understand that everything is being done according to the Lord's supreme plan.

My dear Lord, by Your own potencies You are the original cause of the material elements, as well as the performing instruments (the senses), the workers of the senses (the controlling demigods), the intelligence and the ego, as well as everything else. By Your energy You manifest this entire cosmic creation, maintain it and dissolve it. Through Your energy alone everything is sometimes manifest and sometimes not manifest. You are therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
All activities begin with the creation of the total energy, the mahat-tattva. Then, by the agitation of the three guëas, the physical elements are created, as well as the mind, ego and the controllers of the senses. All of these are created one after another by the inconceivable energy of the Lord. In modern electronics, a mechanic may, by pushing only one button, set off an electronic chain-reaction, by which so many actions are carried out one after another. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead pushes the button of creation, and different energies create the material elements and various controllers of the physical elements, and their subsequent interactions follow the inconceivable plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

saù—He; vai—certainly; bhavän—Yourself; ätma—by Yourself; vinirmitam—manufactured; jagat—this world; bhüta—the physical elements; indriya—senses; antaù-karaëa—mind, heart; ätmakam—consisting of; vibho—O Lord; saàsthäpayiñyan—maintaining; aja—O unborn; mäm—me; rasätalät—from the Plutonic region; abhyujjahära—took out; ambhasaù—from the water; ädi—original; sükaraù—the boar.

My dear Lord, You are always unborn. Once, in the form of the original boar, You rescued me from the waters in the bottom of the universe. Through Your own energy You created all the physical elements, the senses and the heart, for the maintenance of the world.

PURPORT
This refers to the time when Lord Kåñëa appeared as the supreme boar, Varäha, and rescued the earth, which had been merged in water. The asura Hiraëyäkña had dislocated the earth from its orbit and thrown it beneath the waters of the Garbhodaka Ocean. Then the Lord, in the shape of the original boar, rescued the earth.
TEXT 35

apäm—of the water; upasthe—situated on the surface; mayi—in me; nävi—in a boat; avasthitäù—standing; prajäù—living entities; bhavän—Yourself; adya—now; rirakñiñuù—desiring to protect; kila—indeed; saù—He; véra-mürtiù—in the form of a great hero; samabhüt—became; dharä-dharaù—the protector of the planet earth; yaù—one who; mäm—me; payasi—for the sake of milk; ugra-çaraù—with sharpened arrows; jighäàsasi—you desire to kill.

My dear Lord, in this way You once protected me by rescuing me from the water, and consequently Your name has been famous as Dharädhara—He who holds the planet earth. Yet at the present moment, in the form of a great hero, You are about to kill me with sharpened arrows. I am, however, just like a boat on the water, keeping everything afloat.

PURPORT
The Lord is known as Dharädhara, meaning, "He who keeps the planet earth on His tusks as the boar incarnation." Thus the planet earth in the shape of a cow is accounting the contradictory acts of the Lord. Although He once saved the earth, He now wants to upset the earth, which is like a boat on water. No one can understand the activities of the Lord. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, human beings sometimes think the Lord's activities contradictory.

nünam—surely; janaiù—by the people in general; éhitam—activities; éçvaräëäm—of the controllers; asmat-vidhaiù—like me; tat—of the Personality of Godhead; guëa—of the modes of material nature; sarga—which brings forth creation; mäyayä—by Your energy; na—never; jïäyate—are understood; mohita—bewildered; citta—whose minds; vartmabhiù—way; tebhyaù—unto them; namaù—obeisances; véra-yaçaù-karebhyaù—who bring renown to heroes themselves.

My dear Lord, I am also the creation of one of Your energies, composed of the three modes of material nature. Consequently I am bewildered by Your activities. Even the activities of Your devotees cannot be understood, and what to speak of Your pastimes. Thus everything appears to us to be contradictory and wonderful.

PURPORT
The activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms and incarnations are always uncommon and wonderful. It is not possible for a tiny human being to estimate the purpose and plans of such activities; therefore Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has said that unless the Lord's activities are accepted as inconceivable, they cannot be explained. The Lord is eternally existing as Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in Goloka Våndävana. He has also simultaneously expanded Himself in innumerable forms, beginning with Lord Räma, Lord Nåsiàha, Lord Varäha and all the incarnations coming directly from Saìkarñaëa. Saìkarñaëa is the expansion of Baladeva, and Baladeva is the first manifestation of Kåñëa. Therefore all these incarnations are known as kalä.
The word éçvaräëäm refers to all the Personalities of Godhead. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä (5.39): rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is confirmed that all the incarnations are partial expansions, or kalä, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not take the plural number of the word éçvaräëäm to mean that there are many Godheads. The fact is that God is one, but He exists eternally and expands Himself in innumerable forms and acts in various ways. Sometimes the common man is bewildered by all this and considers such activities contradictory, but they are not contradictory. There is a great plan behind all the Lord's activities.
For our understanding it is sometimes said that the Lord is situated in the heart of the thief as well as in the heart of the householder, but the Supersoul in the heart of the thief dictates, "Go and steal things from that particular house," and at the same time the Lord tells the householder, "Now be careful of thieves and burglars." These instructions to different persons appear contradictory, yet we should know that the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has some plan, and we should not consider such activities contradictory. The best course is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead wholeheartedly, and, being protected by Him, remain peaceful.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Mahäräja Påthu Becomes Angry at the Earth."

Song-7 Prayers by King Parthu (SB 4.20.23-31)
TEXT 23
påthur uväca
varän vibho tvad varadeçvaräd budhaù
kathaà våëéte guëa-vikriyätmanäm

tän éça kaivalya-pate våëe na ca


påthuù uväca—Påthu Mahäräja said; varän—benedictions; vibho—my dear Supreme Lord; tvat—from You; vara-da-éçvarät—from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest of the bestowers of benedictions; budhaù—a learned person; katham—how; våëéte—could ask for; guëa-vikriyä—bewildered by the modes of material nature; ätmanäm—of the living entities; ye—which; närakäëäm—of the living entities living in hell; api—also; santi—exist; dehinäm—of the embodied; tän—all those; éça—O Supreme Lord; kaivalya-pate—O bestower of merging in the existence of the Lord; våëe—I ask for; na—not; ca—also.

My dear Lord, You are the best of the demigods who can offer benedictions. Why, therefore, should any learned person ask You for benedictions meant for living entities bewildered by the modes of nature? Such benedictions are available automatically, even in the lives of living entities suffering in hellish conditions. My dear Lord, You can certainly bestow merging into Your existence, but I do not wish to have such a benediction.

PURPORT
There are different kinds of benedictions according to a person's demands. For karmés the best benediction is promotion to the higher planetary systems, where the duration of life is very long and the standard of living and happiness is very high. There are others, namely jïänés and yogés, who want the benediction of merging into the existence of the Lord. This is called kaivalya. The Lord is therefore addressed as kaivalya-pati, the master or Lord of the benediction known as kaivalya. But devotees receive a different type of benediction from the Lord. Devotees are anxious neither for the heavenly planets nor for merging into the existence of the Lord. According to devotees, kaivalya, or merging into the existence of the Lord, is considered as good as hell. The word näraka means "hell." Similarly, everyone who exists in this material world is called näraka because this material existence itself is known as a hellish condition of life. Påthu Mahäräja, however, expressed that he was interested neither in the benediction desired by the karmés nor that desired by the jïänés and yogés. Çréla Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté Prabhu, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, described that kaivalya is no better than a hellish condition of life, and as for the delights of the heavenly planets, they are factually will-o'-the-wisps, or phantasmagorias. They are not wanted by devotees. Devotees do not even care for the positions held by Lord Brahmä or Lord Çiva, nor does a devotee desire to become equal with Lord Viñëu. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Påthu Mahäräja made his position very clear.
TEXT 24
na kämaye nätha tad apy ahaà kvacin
na yatra yuñmac-caraëämbujäsavaù
mahattamäntar-hådayän mukha-cyuto

na—not; kämaye—do I desire; nätha—O master; tat—that; api—even; aham—I; kvacit—at any time; na—not; yatra—where; yuñmat—Your; caraëa-ambuja—of the lotus feet; äsavaù—the nectarean beverage; mahat-tama—of the great devotees; antaù-hådayät—from the core of the heart; mukha—from the mouths; cyutaù—being delivered; vidhatsva—give; karëa—ears; ayutam—one million; eñaù—this; me—my; varaù—benediction.

My dear Lord, I therefore do not wish to have the benediction of merging into Your existence, a benediction in which there is no existence of the nectarean beverage of Your lotus feet. I want the benediction of at least one million ears, for thus I may be able to hear about the glories of Your lotus feet from the mouths of Your pure devotees.

PURPORT
In the previous verse Mahäräja Påthu addressed the Lord as kaivalya-pati, the master of the liberation of merging into His existence. This does not mean that he was anxious for kaivalya liberation. That is made clear in this verse: "My dear Lord, I do not want such a benediction." Mahäräja Påthu wanted to have a million ears to hear the glories of the lotus feet of the Lord. He specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord should emanate from the mouths of pure devotees, who speak from the cores of their hearts. It is stated in the beginning of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.1.3), çuka-mukhäd amåta-drava-saàyutam: the nectar of Çrémad-Bhägavatam became more relishable because it emanated from the mouth of Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. One might think that these glories of the Lord can be heard from anywhere, from the mouths of either devotees or nondevotees, but here it is specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord must emanate from the mouths of pure devotees. Çré Sanätana Gosvämé has strictly prohibited hearing from the mouth of a nondevotee. There are many professional reciters of Çrémad-Bhägavatam who speak the narrations very ornamentally, but a pure devotee does not like to hear from them because such glorification of the Lord is simply a vibration of material sound. But when heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, glorification of the Lord is immediately effective.
The words satäà prasaìgän mama vérya-saàvidaù (SB 3.25.25) mean that glorification of the Lord is potent when uttered from the mouth of a pure devotee. The Lord has innumerable devotees all over the universe, and they have been glorifying the Lord since time immemorial and for an unlimited time. But still they cannot completely finish enumerating the glories of the Lord. Påthu Mahäräja therefore wanted innumerable ears, as Rüpa Gosvämé also desired to have millions of ears and millions of tongues to chant and hear the glorification of the Lord. In other words, if our ears are always engaged in hearing the glorification of the Lord, there will be no scope for hearing the Mäyäväda philosophy, which is doom to spiritual progress. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said that if anyone hears from a Mäyävädé philosopher preaching about the activities of the Lord, even if it is a description from the Vedic literature, he is ultimately doomed. By hearing such Mäyäväda philosophy one cannot come to the destination of spiritual perfection of life.
TEXT 25

saù—that; uttama-çloka—O Lord, who are praised by selected verses; mahat—of great devotees; mukha-cyutaù—delivered from the mouths; bhavat—Your; pada-ambhoja—from the lotus feet; sudhä—of nectar; kaëa—particles; anilaù—soothing breeze; småtim—remembrance; punaù—again; vismåta—forgotten; tattva—to the truth; vartmanäm—of persons whose path; ku-yoginäm—of persons not in the line of devotional service; naù—of us; vitarati—restores; alam—unnecessary; varaiù—other benedictions.

My dear Lord, You are glorified by the selected verses uttered by great personalities. Such glorification of Your lotus feet is just like saffron particles. When the transcendental vibration from the mouths of great devotees carries the aroma of the saffron dust of Your lotus feet, the forgetful living entity gradually remembers his eternal relationship with You. Devotees thus gradually come to the right conclusion about the value of life. My dear Lord, I therefore do not need any other benediction but the opportunity to hear from the mouth of Your pure devotee.

PURPORT
It is explained in the previous verse that one has to hear glorification of the Lord from the mouth of a pure devotee. This is further explained here. The transcendental vibration from the mouth of a pure devotee is so powerful that it can revive the living entity's memory of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our material existence, under the influence of illusory mäyä, we have almost forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord, exactly like a man sleeping very deeply who forgets his duties. In the Vedas it is said that every one of us is sleeping under the influence of mäyä. We must get up from this slumber and engage in the right service, for thus we can properly utilize the facility of this human form of life. As expressed in a song by Öhäkura Bhaktivinoda, Lord Caitanya says, jéva jäga, jéva jäga. The Lord asks every sleeping living entity to get up and engage in devotional service so that his mission in this human form of life may be fulfilled. This awakening voice comes through the mouth of a pure devotee.
A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord, taking shelter of His lotus feet, and therefore he has a direct connection with the saffron mercy-particles that are strewn over the lotus feet of the Lord. Although when a pure devotee speaks the articulation of his voice may resemble the sound of this material sky, the voice is spiritually very powerful because it touches the particles of saffron dust on the lotus feet of the Lord. As soon as a sleeping living entity hears the powerful voice emanating from the mouth of a pure devotee, he immediately remembers his eternal relationship with the Lord, although up until that moment he had forgotten everything.
For a conditioned soul, therefore, it is very important to hear from the mouth of a pure devotee, who is fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord without any material desire, speculative knowledge or contamination of the modes of material nature. Every one of us is kuyogé because we have engaged in the service of this material world, forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord as His eternal loving servants. It is our duty to rise from the kuyoga platform to become suyogés, perfect mystics. The process of hearing from a pure devotee is recommended in all Vedic scriptures, especially by Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu. One may stay in his position of life—it does not matter what it is—but if one hears from the mouth of a pure devotee, he gradually comes to the understanding of his relationship with the Lord and thus engages in His loving service, and his life becomes completely perfect. Therefore, this process of hearing from the mouth of a pure devotee is very important for making progress in the line of spiritual understanding.
TEXT 26

yaçaù—glorification; çivam—all-auspicious; su-çravaù—O highly glorified Lord; ärya-saìgame—in the association of advanced devotees; yadåcchayä—somehow or other; ca—also; upaçåëoti—hears; te—Your; sakåt—even once; katham—how; guëa-jïaù—one who appreciates good qualities; viramet—can cease; vinä—unless; paçum—an animal; çréù—the goddess of fortune; yat—which; pravavre—accepted; guëa—Your qualities; saìgraha—to receive; icchayä—with a desire.

My dear highly glorified Lord, if one, in the association of pure devotees, hears even once the glories of Your activities, he does not, unless he is nothing but an animal, give up the association of devotees, for no intelligent person would be so careless as to leave their association. The perfection of chanting and hearing about Your glories was accepted even by the goddess of fortune, who desired to hear of Your unlimited activities and transcendental glories.

PURPORT
The association of devotees (ärya-saìgama) is the most important factor in this world. The word ärya refers to those who are advancing spiritually. In the history of the human race, the Äryan family is considered to be the most elevated community in the world because it adopts the Vedic civilization. The Äryan family is distributed all over the world and is known as Indo-Äryan. In prehistoric days all of the members of the Äryan family followed the Vedic principles, and therefore they became spiritually advanced. The kings, known as räjarñis, were so perfectly educated as kñatriyas, or protectors of the citizens, and so greatly advanced in spiritual life, that there was not a bit of trouble for the citizens.
The glorification of the Supreme Lord can be very much appreciated by the Äryan family. Although there is no bar for others, the members of the Äryan family very quickly catch the essence of spiritual life. How is it that we are finding it very easy to spread Kåñëa consciousness among the Europeans and Americans? History reports that the Americans and Europeans proved their capability when they were anxious to expand colonization, but at the present time, being contaminated by the advancement of material science, their sons and grandsons are turning into reprobates. This is due to their having lost their original spiritual culture, which is Vedic civilization. Presently these descendants of the Äryan family are taking this Kåñëa consciousness movement very seriously. Others who are associating with them and hearing the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra from the lips of pure devotees are also becoming captivated by the transcendental vibration. Transcendental vibrations are very much effective when chanted among Äryans, but even though one does not belong to the Äryan family, he will become a Vaiñëava simply by hearing the mantra because the vibration has great influence over everyone.
Mahäräja Påthu points out that even the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Lord Näräyaëa, specifically wanted to hear about the Lord's glories, and for the association of the gopés, who are pure devotees, the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, underwent severe austerities. The impersonalist may ask why one should bother chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra continually for so many years instead of stopping and trying for kaivalya, liberation, or merging into the existence of the Lord. In answer, Mahäräja Påthu maintains that the attraction of this chanting is so great that one cannot give up the process unless he is an animal. This is the case even if one comes in contact with this transcendental vibration by chance. Påthu Mahäräja is very emphatic in this connection—only an animal can give up the practice of chanting Hare Kåñëa. Those who are not animals but actually intelligent, advanced, human, civilized men cannot give up this practice of continually chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.
TEXT 27

atha—therefore; äbhaje—I shall engage in devotional service; tvä—unto You; akhila—all-inclusive; püruña-uttamam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; guëa-älayam—the reservoir of all transcendental qualities; padma-karä—the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand; iva—like; lälasaù—being desirous; api—indeed; ävayoù—of Lakñmé and me; eka-pati—one master; spådhoù—competing; kaliù—quarrel; na—not; syät—may take place; kåta—having done; tvat-caraëa—unto Your lotus feet; eka-tänayoù—one attention.

Now I wish to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to serve just like the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand, because His Lordship, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. I am afraid that the goddess of fortune and I would quarrel because both of us would be attentively engaged in the same service.

PURPORT
The Lord is here addressed as akhila-püruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the entire creation. Puruña means "the enjoyer," and uttama means "the best." There are different kinds of puruñas, or enjoyers, within the universe. Generally they can be divided into three classes—those who are conditioned, those who are liberated and those who are eternal. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is called the supreme eternal of all eternals (nityo nityänäm). Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are eternal. The supreme eternals are the viñëu-tattva, or Lord Viñëu and His expansions. So nitya refers to the Personality of Godhead, beginning from Kåñëa to Mahä-Viñëu, Näräyaëa and other expansions of Lord Kåñëa. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (rämädi-mürtiñu), there are millions and trillions of expansions of Lord Viñëu, as Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and other incarnations. All of them are called eternals.
The word mukta refers to the living entities who never come within this material world. The baddhas are those living entities who are almost eternally living within this material world. The baddhas are struggling very hard within this material world to become free from the threefold miseries of material nature and to enjoy life, whereas the muktas are already liberated. They never come into this material world. Lord Viñëu is the master of this material world, and there is no question of His being controlled by material nature. Consequently, Lord Viñëu is addressed here as püruñottama, the best of all living entities—namely viñëu-tattvas and jéva-tattvas. It is a great offense, therefore, to compare Lord Viñëu and the jéva-tattva or consider them on an equal level. The Mäyävädé philosophers equalize the jévas and the Supreme Lord and consider them to be one, but that is the greatest offense to the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu.
Here in the material world we have practical experience that a superior person is worshiped by an inferior one. Similarly, püruñottama, the greatest, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or Lord Viñëu, is always worshiped by others. Påthu Mahäräja therefore decided to engage in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu. Påthu Mahäräja is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Viñëu, but he is called a çaktyäveça incarnation. Another significant word in this verse is guëälayam, which refers to Viñëu as the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. The Mäyävädé philosophers take the Absolute Truth to be nirguëa ("without qualities"), in accordance with the impersonalistic view, but actually the Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities. One of the most important qualities of the Lord is His inclination to His devotees, for which He is called bhakta-vatsala. The devotees are always very much inclined to render service unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord is also very much inclined to accept loving service from His devotees. In that exchange of service there are many transcendental transactions, which are called transcendental qualitative activities. Some of the transcendental qualities of the Lord are that He is omniscient, omnipresent, all-pervasive, all-powerful, the cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, the reservoir of all pleasures, the reservoir of all knowledge, the all-auspicious and so on.
Påthu Mahäräja desired to serve the Lord with the goddess of fortune, but this desire does not mean that he was situated on the platform of mädhurya-rasa. The goddess of fortune is engaged in the service of the Lord in the rasa of mädhurya, conjugal love. Although her position is on the chest of the Lord, the goddess of fortune, in her position as a devotee, takes pleasure in serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Påthu Mahäräja was thinking only of the lotus feet of the Lord because he is on the platform of däsya-rasa, or servitorship of the Lord. From the next verse we learn that Påthu Mahäräja was thinking of the goddess of fortune as the universal mother, jagan-mätä. Consequently there was no question of his competing with her on the platform of mädhurya-rasa. Nonetheless he feared that she might take offense at his engaging in the service of the Lord. This suggests that in the absolute world there is sometimes competition between servitors in the service of the Lord, but such competition is without malice. In the Vaikuëöha worlds if a devotee excels in the service of the Lord, others do not become envious of his excellent service but rather aspire to come to the platform of that service.

jagat-jananyäm—in the mother of the universe (Lakñmé); jagat-éça—O Lord of the universe; vaiçasam—anger; syät—may arise; eva—certainly; yat-karmaëi—in whose activity; naù—my; saméhitam—desire; karoñi—You consider; phalgu—insignificant service; api—even; uru—very great; déna-vatsalaù—favorably inclined to the poor; sve—own; eva—certainly; dhiñëye—in Your opulence; abhiratasya—of one who is fully satisfied; kim—what need is there; tayä—with her.

My dear Lord of the universe, the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé, is the mother of the universe, and yet I think that she may be angry with me because of my intruding upon her service and acting on that very platform to which she is so much attached. Yet I am hopeful that even though there is some misunderstanding, You will take my part, for You are very much inclined to the poor and You always magnify even insignificant service unto You. Therefore even though she becomes angry, I think that there is no harm for You, because You are so self-sufficient that You can do without her.

PURPORT
Mother Lakñméjé, the goddess of fortune, is well known for always massaging the lotus feet of Lord Näräyaëa. She is an ideal wife because she takes care of Lord Näräyaëa in every detail. She takes care not only of His lotus feet but of the household affairs of the Lord as well. She cooks nice foods for Him, fans Him while He eats, smoothes sandalwood pulp on His face and sets His bed and sitting places in the right order. In this way she is always engaged in the service of the Lord, and there is hardly any opportunity for any other devotee to intrude upon His daily activities. Påthu Mahäräja was therefore almost certain that his intrusion into the service of the goddess of fortune would irritate her and cause her to become angry with him. But why should mother Lakñmé, the mother of the universe, be angry with an insignificant devotee like Påthu Mahäräja? All this was not very likely. Yet Påthu Mahäräja, just for his personal protection, appealed to the Lord to take his part. Påthu Mahäräja was engaged in performing the ordinary Vedic rituals and sacrifices according to karma-käëòa, or fruitive activities, but the Lord, being so kind and magnanimous, was ready to award Påthu Mahäräja the highest perfectional stage of life, namely devotional service.
When a person performs Vedic rituals and sacrifices, he does so to elevate himself to the heavenly planets. No one can become qualified to go back home, back to Godhead, by means of such sacrifices. But the Lord is so kind that He accepts a little insignificant service, and therefore it is stated in the Viñëu Puräëa that by following the principles of varëäçrama-dharma one can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, the performer of sacrifices is elevated to the platform of devotional service. Påthu Mahäräja therefore expected that his insignificant service to the Lord would be accepted by Him as being greater than that of Lakñméjé. The goddess of fortune is called caïcalä ("restless") because she is very restless and is always coming and going. So Påthu Mahäräja indicated that even though she might go away out of anger, there would be no harm for Lord Viñëu, because He is self-sufficient and can do anything and everything without the help of Lakñméjé. For example, when Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu begot Lord Brahmä from His navel, He did not take any help from Lakñmé, who was just sitting by Him and massaging His lotus feet. Generally if a son is to be begotten, the husband impregnates the wife, and in due course of time the son is born. But in the case of Lord Brahmä's birth, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu did not impregnate Lakñméjé. Being self-sufficient, the Lord begot Brahmä from His own navel. Therefore, Påthu Mahäräja was confident that even if the goddess of fortune became angry with him there would be no harm, neither to the Lord nor to himself.

Great saintly persons who are always liberated take to Your devotional service because only by devotional service can one be relieved from the illusions of material existence. O my Lord, there is no reason for the liberated souls to take shelter at Your lotus feet except that such souls are constantly thinking of Your feet.

PURPORT
The karmés are generally engaged in fruitive activities for material bodily comforts. The jïänés, however, are disgusted with searching after material comforts. They understand that they have nothing to do with this material world, being spirit souls. After self-realization, the jïänés who are actually mature in their knowledge must surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (bahünäà janmanäm ante [Bg. 7.19]). Self-realization is not complete unless one comes to the devotional platform. Therefore it is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam that those who are ätmäräma, self-satisfied, are freed from all contaminations of the material modes of nature. As long as one is affected by the modes of material nature, especially by rajas and tamas, he will be very greedy and lusty and will therefore engage in hard tasks, laboring all day and night. Such false egoism carries one from one species of life into another perpetually, and there is no rest in any species of life. The jïäné understands this fact and therefore ceases to work and takes to karma-sannyäsa.
Yet this is not actually the platform of satisfaction. After self-realization, the material wisdom of the jïäné leads him to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Then he is satisfied only in contemplating the lotus feet of the Lord constantly. Påthu Mahäräja therefore concluded that liberated persons taking to the devotional path have acquired the ultimate goal of life. If liberation were the end in itself, there would be no question of a liberated person's taking to devotional service. In other words, the transcendental bliss derived from self-realization, known as ätmänanda, is very insignificant in the presence of the bliss derived from devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. Påthu Mahäräja therefore concluded that he would simply hear of the glories of the Lord constantly and thus engage his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life.

manye—I consider; giram—words; te—Your; jagatäm—to the material world; vimohiném—bewildering; varam—benediction; våëéñva—just accept; iti—in this way; bhajantam—unto Your devotee; ättha—You spoke; yat—because; väcä—by the statements of the Vedas; nu—certainly; tantyä—by the ropes; yadi—if; te—Your; janaù—the people in general; asitaù—not bound; katham—how; punaù—again and again; karma—fruitive activities; karoti—perform; mohitaù—being enamored.

My dear Lord, what You have said to Your unalloyed devotee is certainly very much bewildering. The allurements You offer in the Vedas are certainly not suitable for pure devotees. People in general, bound by the sweet words of the Vedas, engage themselves again and again in fruitive activities, enamored with the results of their actions.

PURPORT
Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura, a great äcärya of the Gauòéya-sampradäya, has said that persons who are very much attached to the fruitive activities of the Vedas, namely karma-käëòa and jïäna-kanda, are certainly doomed. In the Vedas there are three categories of activities, known as karma-käëòa (fruitive activities), jïäna-käëòa (philosophical research) and upäsanä-käëòa (worship of different demigods for receiving material benefits). Those who are engaged in karma-käëòa and jïäna-käëòa are doomed in the sense that everyone is doomed who is entrapped by this material body, whether it is a body of a demigod, a king, a lower animal or whatever. The sufferings of the threefold miseries of material nature are the same for all. Cultivation of knowledge to understand one's spiritual position is also, to a certain extent, a waste of time. Because the living entity is an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his immediate business is to engage himself in devotional service. Påthu Mahäräja therefore says that the allurement of material benedictions is another trap to entangle one in this material world. He therefore frankly tells the Lord that the Lord's offerings of benedictions in the form of material facilities are certainly causes for bewilderment. A pure devotee is not at all interested in bhukti or mukti.
The Lord sometimes offers benedictions to the neophyte devotees who have not yet understood that material facilities will not make them happy. In the Caitanya-caritämåta the Lord therefore says that a sincere devotee who is not very intelligent may ask some material benefit from the Lord, but the Lord, being omniscient, does not generally give material rewards but, on the contrary, takes away whatever material facilities are being enjoyed by His devotee, so that ultimately the devotee will completely surrender unto Him. In other words, the offering of benedictions in the form of material profit is never auspicious for the devotee. The statements of the Vedas which offer elevation to heavenly planets in exchange for great sacrifices are simply bewildering. Therefore in Bhagavad-gétä (2.42) the Lord says: yäm imäà puñpitäà väcaà pravadanty avipaçcitaù. The less intelligent class of men (avipaçcitaù), attracted by the flowery language of the Vedas, engage in fruitive activities to become materially benefited. Thus they continue life after life, in different bodily forms, to search very, very hard.

tvat—Your; mäyayä—by illusory energy; addhä—certainly; janaù—the people in general; éça—O my Lord; khaëòitaù—separated; yat—because; anyat—other; äçäste—they desire; åta—real; ätmanaù—from the self; abudhaù—without proper understanding; yathä—as; caret—would engage in; bäla-hitam—the welfare of one's child; pitä—the father; svayam—personally; tathä—similarly; tvam—Your Lordship; eva—certainly; arhasi naù saméhitum—please act on my behalf.

My Lord, due to Your illusory energy, all living beings in this material world have forgotten their real constitutional position, and out of ignorance they are always desirous of material happiness in the form of society, friendship and love. Therefore, please do not ask me to take some material benefits from You, but as a father, not waiting for the son's demand, does everything for the benefit of the son, please bestow upon me whatever You think best for me.

PURPORT
It is the duty of the son to depend upon his father without asking anything from him. The good son has faith that the father knows best how to benefit him. Similarly, a pure devotee does not ask anything from the Lord for material benefit. Nor does he ask anything for spiritual benefit. The pure devotee is fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord takes charge of him, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (18.66): ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi. The father knows the necessities of the son and supplies them, and the Supreme Lord knows the necessities of the living entities and supplies them sumptuously. Therefore the Éçopaniñad states that everything in this material world is complete (pürëam idam [Éçopaniñad, Invocation]). The difficulty is that due to forgetfulness the living entities create unnecessary demands and entangle themselves in material activities. The result is that there is no end to material activities, life after life.
Before us there are varieties of living entities, and everyone is entangled in transmigrations and activities. Our duty is simply to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and let Him take charge, for He knows what is good for us.
Påthu Mahäräja therefore tells the Lord that, as the supreme father, He may elect to bestow whatever He considers beneficial for Påthu Mahäräja. That is the perfect position of the living entity. Therefore Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu teaches us in His Çikñäñöaka:
na dhanaà na janaà na sundaréà
kavitäà vä jagad-éça kämaye
mama janmani janmanéçvare
bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi
 [Cc. Antya 20.29, Çikñäñöaka 4]
"O almighty Lord! I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor have I any desire to enjoy beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service in my life, birth after birth."
The conclusion is that the pure devotee should not aspire after any material benefit from devotional service, nor should he be enamored with fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. He should always be engaged favorably in the service of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life.

Song-8 Rudra-gita (SB 4.24.33-79)
TEXT 33
çré-rudra uväca
jitaà ta ätma-vid-varya-
svastaye svastir astu me
bhavatärädhasä räddhaà
sarvasmä ätmane namaù


çré-rudraù uväca—Lord Çiva began to speak; jitam—all glories; te—unto You; ätma-vit—self-realized; varya—the best; svastaye—unto the auspicious; svastiù—auspiciousness; astu—let there be; me—of me; bhavatä—by You; ärädhasä—by the all-perfect; räddham—worshipable; sarvasmai—the Supreme Soul; ätmane—unto the Supreme Soul; namaù—obeisances.

Lord Çiva addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead with the following prayer: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all glories unto You. You are the most exalted of all self-realized souls. Since You are always auspicious for the self-realized, I wish that You be auspicious for me. You are worshipable by virtue of the all-perfect instructions You give. You are the Supersoul; therefore I offer my obeisances unto You as the supreme living being.

PURPORT
As soon as a devotee is inspired by the Lord to offer the Lord a prayer, the devotee immediately glorifies the Lord in the beginning by saying, "All glories unto You, my Lord." The Lord is glorified because He is considered to be the chief of all self-realized souls. As said in the Vedas (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13), nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm: the Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the chief living being amongst all living beings. There are different kinds of individual living beings—some of them are in this material world, and some are in the spiritual world. Those who are in the spiritual world are known to be completely self-realized because on the spiritual platform the living entity is not forgetful of his service to the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world all those who are in the devotional service of the Lord are eternally fixed, for they understand the position of the Supreme Being, as well as their individual constitution. Thus amongst self-realized souls, the Lord is known as the perfectly self-realized soul. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). When the individual soul is fixed in his knowledge of the Lord as the Supreme Being, he actually becomes established in an all-auspicious position. Lord Çiva prays herein that his auspicious position continue eternally by virtue of the Lord's mercy upon him.
The Supreme Lord is all-perfect, and the Lord instructs that one who worships Him also becomes perfect. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15): mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca. The Lord is situated as the Supersoul in everyone's heart, but He is so kind to His devotees that He gives them instructions by which they may continue to progress. When they receive instructions from the all-perfect, there is no chance of their being misled. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (10.10): dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà yena mäm upayänti te. The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the pure devotee so that the devotee can advance further and further in devotional service. Since the Lord gives instructions as sarvätmä, the Supersoul, Lord Çiva offers Him respect with the words sarvasmä ätmane namaù. The individual soul is called ätmä, and the Lord is also called ätmä as well as Paramätmä. Being situated in everyone's heart, the Lord is known as the supreme ätmä. Therefore all obeisances are offered unto Him. In this regard, one may refer to the prayers of Kunté in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.8.20):
tathä paramahaàsänäà
munénäm amalätmanäm
bhakti-yoga-vidhänärthaà
kathaà paçyema hi striyaù
The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the paramahaàsas, or the topmost devotees of the Lord, who are completely liberated from all contaminations of the material world. The Lord always gives instructions to such exalted devotees to inform them how they can remain fixed in devotional service. Similarly, it is stated in the ätmäräma verse (SB 1.7.10):
ätmärämäç ca munayo
nirgranthä apy urukrame
kurvanty ahaitukéà bhaktim
ittham-bhüta-guëo hariù
The word ätmäräma refers to those who are not interested in the material world but are simply engaged in spiritual realization. Such self-realized persons are generally considered in two categories—impersonal and personal. However, impersonalists also become devotees when they are attracted by the personal transcendental qualities of the Lord. The conclusion is that Lord Çiva wanted to remain a fixed devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. As explained in the following verses, Lord Çiva never desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord like the impersonalists. Rather, he thinks that it would be good fortune for him to continue to be fixed in the understanding of the Lord as the Supreme Being. By this understanding, one realizes that all living entities—including Lord Çiva, Lord Brahmä and other demigods—are servants of the Supreme Lord.
TEXT 34
namaù paìkaja-näbhäya
bhüta-sükñmendriyätmane
väsudeväya çäntäya
küöa-sthäya sva-rociñe


namaù—all obeisances unto You; paìkaja-näbhäya—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whose navel the lotus flower emanates; bhüta-sükñma—the sense objects; indriya—the senses; ätmane—the origin; väsudeväya—unto Lord Väsudeva; çäntäya—always peaceful; küöa-sthäya—without being changed; sva-rociñe—unto the supreme illumination.

My Lord, You are the origin of the creation by virtue of the lotus flower which sprouts from Your navel. You are the supreme controller of the senses and the sense objects, and You are also the all-pervading Väsudeva. You are most peaceful, and because of Your self-illuminated existence, You are not disturbed by the six kinds of transformations.

PURPORT
The Lord as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu lies in the ocean of Garbha within this universe, and from His navel the lotus flower sprouts. Lord Brahmä is generated from that lotus flower, and from Lord Brahmä the creation of this material world begins. As such, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, is the origin of the material senses and sense objects. Since Lord Çiva considers himself to be one of the products of the material world, his senses are under the control of the supreme creator. The Supreme Lord is also known as Håñékeça, master of the senses, which indicates that our senses and sense objects are formed by the Supreme Lord. As such, He can control our senses and out of His mercy engage them in the service of the master of the senses. In the conditioned state, the living entity struggles in this material world and engages his senses for material satisfaction. However, if the living entity is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can engage these very senses in the service of the Lord. Lord Çiva desires not to be misled by the material senses but to engage always in the service of the Lord without being subject to contamination by materialistic influences. By the grace and help of Lord Väsudeva, who is all-pervading, one can engage his senses in devotional service without deviation, just as the Lord acts without deviation.
The words çäntäya küöa-sthäya sva-rociñe are very significant. Although the Lord is within this material world, He is not disturbed by the waves of material existence. However, conditioned souls are agitated by six kinds of transformations; namely, they become agitated when they are hungry, when they are thirsty, when they are aggrieved, when they are illusioned, when they grow old and when they are on the deathbed. Although conditioned souls become very easily illusioned by these conditions in the material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Supersoul, Väsudeva, is never agitated by these transformations. Therefore it is said here (küöa-sthäya) that He is always peaceful and devoid of agitation because of His prowess, which is described herein as sva-rociñe, indicating that He is illuminated by His own transcendental position. In other words, the individual soul, although within the illumination of the Supreme, sometimes falls down from that illumination because of his tiny position, and when he falls down he enters into material, conditional life. The Lord, however, is not subject to such conditioning; therefore He is described as self-illuminated. Consequently any conditioned soul within this material universe can remain completely perfect when he is under the protection of Väsudeva, or when he is engaged in devotional service.
TEXT 35
saìkarñaëäya sükñmäya

saìkarñaëäya—unto the master of integration; sükñmäya—unto the subtle unmanifested material ingredients; durantäya—unto the unsurpassable; antakäya—unto the master of disintegration; ca—also; namaù—obeisances; viçva-prabodhäya—unto the master of the development of the universe; pradyumnäya—unto Lord Pradyumna; antaù-ätmane—unto the Supersoul in everyone's heart.

My dear Lord, You are the origin of the subtle material ingredients, the master of all integration as well as the master of all disintegration, the predominating Deity named Saìkarñaëa, and the master of all intelligence, known as the predominating Deity Pradyumna. Therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
The whole universe is maintained by the integrating power of the Supreme Lord, who is known in that capacity by the name Saìkarñaëa. The material scientists may have discovered the law of gravity, which maintains the integration of objects within the material energy, yet the master of all integration can create devastation by the disintegrating blazing fire emanating from His mouth. A description of this can be found in the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, wherein the universal form of the Lord is described. The master of integration is also the destroyer of this world by virtue of His disintegrating energy. Saìkarñaëa is the master of integration and disintegration, whereas Pradyumna, another feature of Lord Väsudeva, is responsible for universal growth and maintenance. The word sükñmäya is significant because within this gross material body there are subtle material bodies—namely mind, intelligence and ego. The Lord in His different features (Väsudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saìkarñaëa) maintains both the gross and subtle material elements of this world. As mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä, the gross material elements are earth, water, fire, air and ether, and the subtle material elements are mind, intelligence and ego. All of them are controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and this will be further explained in the following verse.
TEXT 36
namo namo 'niruddhäya

namaù—all my obeisances unto You; namaù—obeisances again; aniruddhäya—unto Lord Aniruddha; håñékeça—the master of the senses; indriya-ätmane—the director of the senses; namaù—all obeisances unto You; parama-haàsäya—unto the supreme perfect; pürëäya—unto the supreme complete; nibhåta-ätmane—who is situated apart from this material creation.

My Lord, as the supreme directing Deity known as Aniruddha, You are the master of the senses and the mind. I therefore offer my obeisances unto You again and again. You are known as Ananta as well as Saìkarñaëa because of Your ability to destroy the whole creation by the blazing fire from Your mouth.

PURPORT
Håñékeçendriyätmane. The mind is the director of the senses, and Lord Aniruddha is the director of the mind. In order to execute devotional service, one has to fix his mind on the lotus feet of Kåñëa; therefore Lord Çiva prays to the controller of the mind, Lord Aniruddha, to be pleased to help him engage his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä (9.34): man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäm namaskuru. The mind has to be engaged in meditation on the lotus feet of the Lord in order to execute devotional service. It is also stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca: from the Lord come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. Thus if Lord Aniruddha is pleased, He can help the mind engage in the service of the Lord. It is also indicated in this verse that Lord Aniruddha is the sun-god by virtue of His expansions. Since the predominating deity of the sun is an expansion of Lord Aniruddha, Lord Çiva also prays to the sun-god in this verse.
Lord Kåñëa, by His quadruple expansion (Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha), is the Lord of psychic action—namely thinking, feeling, willing and acting. Lord Çiva prays to Lord Aniruddha as the sun-god, who is the controlling deity of the external material elements which constitute the construction of the material body. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word paramahaàsa is also another name for the sun-god. The sun-god is addressed herein as nibhåtätmane, which indicates that he always maintains the various planets by manipulating the rainfall. The sun-god evaporates water from the seas and oceans and then forms the water into clouds and distributes it over land. When there is sufficient rainfall grains are produced, and these grains maintain living entities in each and every planet. The sun-god is also addressed herein as pürëa, or complete, because the rays emanating from the sun have no end. For millions and millions of years since the creation of this universe, the sun-god has been supplying heat and light without diminution. The word paramahaàsa is applied to persons who are completely cleansed. When there is sufficient sunshine, the mind remains clear and transparent—in other words, the sun-god helps the mind of the living entity to become situated on the platform of paramahaàsa. Thus Lord Çiva prays to Aniruddha to be kind upon him so that his mind will always be in the perfect state of cleanliness and will be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Just as fire sterilizes all unclean things, the sun-god also keeps everything sterilized, especially dirty things within the mind, thus enabling one to attain elevation to the platform of spiritual understanding.
TEXT 37

svarga—the heavenly planets; apavarga—the path of liberation; dväräya—unto the door of; nityam—eternally; çuci-sade—unto the most purified; namaù—my obeisances unto You; namaù—my obeisances; hiraëya—gold; véryäya—semen; cätuù-hoträya—the Vedic sacrifices of the name; tantave—unto one who expands.

My Lord, O Aniruddha, You are the authority by which the doors of the higher planetary systems and liberation are opened. You are always within the pure heart of the living entity. Therefore I offer my obeisances unto You. You are the possessor of semen which is like gold, and thus, in the form of fire, You help the Vedic sacrifices, beginning with cätur-hotra. Therefore I offer my obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
The word svarga indicates a position in the higher or heavenly planetary systems, and the word apavarga means "liberation." Those who are attached to the karma-käëòéya activities described in the Vedas are actually entangled in the three modes of material nature. The Bhagavad-gétä therefore says that one should be above the dominion of fruitive activities. There are different kinds of liberation, or mukti. The best mukti is engagement in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Not only does Lord Aniruddha help fruitive actors by elevating them to the higher planetary systems, but He also helps the devotee engage in devotional service by dint of His inexhaustible energy. Just as heat is the source of material energy, the inspiration of Lord Aniruddha is the energy by which one can engage in executing devotional service.
TEXT 38

namaù—I offer all obeisances unto You; ürje—unto the provider of the Pitåloka; iñe—the provider of all the demigods; trayyäù—of the three Vedas; pataye—unto the master; yajïa—sacrifices; retase—unto the predominating deity of the moon planet; tåpti-däya—unto Him who gives satisfaction to everyone; ca—also; jévänäm—of the living entities; namaù—I offer my obeisances; sarva-rasa-ätmane—unto the all-pervading Supersoul.

My Lord, You are the provider of the Pitålokas as well as all the demigods. You are the predominating deity of the moon and the master of all three Vedas. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because You are the original source of satisfaction for all living entities.

PURPORT
When the living entity is born within this material world—especially as a human being—he has several obligations unto the demigods, unto the saintly persons and unto living entities in general. As enjoined in the çästras: devarñi-bhütäpta-nåëäà pitèëäm (SB 11.5.41). Thus one has an obligation to one's forefathers, the previous hierarchy. Lord Çiva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so he can become free from all obligation to the Pitäs, demigods, general living entities and saintly persons and completely engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. As stated:
devarñi-bhütäpta-nåëäà pitèëäà
na kiìkaro näyam åëé ca räjan
sarvätmanä yaù çaraëaà çaraëyaà
gato mukundaà parihåtya kartam
One becomes free from all obligations to the demigods, saintly persons, pitäs, ancient forefathers, etc., if one is completely engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Lord Çiva therefore prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so that he can be free from such obligations and entirely engage in the Lord's service.
Soma, or the predominating deity of the moon, is responsible for the living entity's ability to relish the taste of food through the tongue. Lord Çiva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so that he will not taste anything but the prasäda of the Lord. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has sung a verse indicating that the tongue is the most formidable enemy among all the senses. If one can control the tongue, he can easily control the other senses. The tongue can be controlled only by eating prasäda offered to the Deity. Lord Çiva's prayer to Lord Aniruddha is meant for this purpose (tåpti-däya); he prays to Lord Aniruddha to help him be satisfied by eating only prasäda offered to the Lord.

sarva—all; sattva—existence; ätma—soul; dehäya—unto the body; viçeñäya—diversity; sthavéyase—unto the material world; namaù—offering obeisances; trai-lokya—three planetary systems; päläya—maintainer; saha—along with; ojaù—prowess; baläya—unto the strength; ca—also.

My dear Lord, You are the gigantic universal form which contains all the individual bodies of the living entities. You are the maintainer of the three worlds, and as such You maintain the mind, senses, body, and air of life within them. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
As the individual body of the living entity is composed of millions of cells, germs and microbes, the universal body of the Supreme Lord similarly contains all the individual bodies of the living entities. Lord Çiva is offering his obeisances to the universal body, which includes all other bodies, so that everyone's body may fully engage in devotional service. Since this individual body is composed of senses, all the senses should be engaged in devotional service. For instance, the smelling instrument, the nose, can engage in smelling the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, the hands can engage in cleansing the temple of the Lord, etc. Indeed, being the life air of every living entity, the Lord is the maintainer of the three worlds. Consequently He can induce every living entity to engage in his real life's duty with full bodily and mental strength. Thus every living entity should serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his präëa (life), artha (wealth), intelligence and words. As stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.22.35):
etävaj janma-säphalyaà
dehinäm iha dehiñu
präëair arthair dhiyä väcä
çreya-äcaraëaà sadä
Even though one may desire to engage in the service of the Lord, without sanction one cannot do so. Lord Çiva is offering his prayers in so many different ways in order to show living entities how to engage in the devotional service of the Lord.
TEXT 40

artha—meaning; liìgäya—revealing; nabhase—unto the sky; namaù—offering obeisances; antaù—within; bahiù—and without; ätmane—unto the self; namaù—offering obeisances; puëyäya—pious activities; lokäya—for creation; amuñmai—beyond death; bhüri-varcase—the supreme effulgence.

My dear Lord, by expanding Your transcendental vibrations, You reveal the actual meaning of everything. You are the all-pervading sky within and without, and You are the ultimate goal of pious activities executed both within this material world and beyond it. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances again and again unto You.

PURPORT
Vedic evidence is called çabda-brahma. There are many things which are beyond the perception of our imperfect senses, yet the authoritative evidence of sound vibration is perfect. The Vedas are known as çabda-brahma because evidence taken from the Vedas constitutes the ultimate understanding. This is because çabda-brahma, or the Vedas, represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, the real essence of çabda-brahma is the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra. By vibrating this transcendental sound, the meaning of everything, both material and spiritual, is revealed. This Hare Kåñëa is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. The meaning of everything is received through the air through sound vibration. The vibration may be material or spiritual, but without sound vibration no one can understand the meaning of anything. In the Vedas it is said, antar bahiç ca tat sarvaà vyäpya näräyaëaù sthitaù: "Näräyaëa is all-pervading, and He exists both within and without." This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (13.34):
yathä prakäçayaty ekaù
kåtsnaà lokam imaà raviù
kñetraà kñetré tathä kåtsnaà
prakäçayati bhärata
"O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so do the living entity and the Supersoul illuminate the entire body by consciousness."
In other words, the consciousness of both the soul and Supersoul is all-pervading; the limited consciousness of the living entity is pervading the entire material body, and the supreme consciousness of the Lord is pervading the entire universe. Because the soul is present within the body, consciousness pervades the entire body; similarly, because the supreme soul, or Kåñëa, is present within this universe, everything is working in order. Mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram: "This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunté, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings." (Bg. 9.10)
Lord Çiva is therefore praying to the Personality of Godhead to be kind to us so that simply by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra we can understand everything in both the material and spiritual worlds. The word amuñmai is significant in this regard because it indicates the best target one can aim for after attaining the higher planetary systems. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities (karmés) attain the higher planetary systems as a result of their past activities, and the jïänés, who seek unification or a monistic merging with the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, also attain their desired end, but in the ultimate issue, the devotees, who desire to personally associate with the Lord, are promoted to the Vaikuëöhalokas or Goloka Våndävana. The Lord is described in Bhagavad-gétä (10.12) as pavitraà paramam, the supreme pure. This is also confirmed in this verse. Çukadeva Gosvämé has stated that the cowherd boys who played with Lord Kåñëa were not ordinary living entities. Only after accumulating many pious activities in various births does one get the opportunity to personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since only the pure can reach Him, He is the supreme pure.
TEXT 41
pravåttäya nivåttäya
pitå-deväya karmaëe
namo 'dharma-vipäkäya
måtyave duùkha-däya ca


pravåttäya—inclination; nivåttäya—disinclination; pitå-deväya—unto the master of Pitåloka; karmaëe—unto the resultant action of fruitive activities; namaù—offering respects; adharma—irreligious; vipäkäya—unto the result; måtyave—unto death; duùkha-däya—the cause of all kinds of miserable conditions; ca—also.

My dear Lord, You are the viewer of the results of pious activities. You are inclination, disinclination and their resultant activities. You are the cause of the miserable conditions of life caused by irreligion, and therefore You are death. I offer You my respectful obeisances.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart, and from Him issue a living entity's inclinations and disinclinations. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15):
sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo
mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."
The Supreme Personality of Godhead causes the asuras to forget Him and the devotees to remember Him. One's disinclinations are due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Bhagavad-gétä (16.7), pravåttià ca nivåttià ca janä na vidur äsuräù: the asuras do not know which way one should be inclined to act and which way one should not be inclined to act. Although the asuras oppose devotional service, it is to be understood that they are inclined that way due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because the asuras do not like to engage in the Lord's devotional service, the Lord within gives them the intelligence to forget. Ordinary karmés desire promotion to Pitåloka, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (9.25). Yänti deva-vratä devän pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù: "Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods, and those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors."
In this verse the word duùkha-däya is also very significant, for those who are nondevotees are perpetually put into the cycle of birth and death. This is a very miserable condition. Because one's position in life is attained according to one's activities, the asuras, or nondevotees, are put into such miserable conditions.

namaù—offering obeisances; te—unto You; äçiñäm éça—O topmost of all bestowers of benediction; manave—unto the supreme mind or supreme Manu; käraëa-ätmane—the supreme cause of all causes; namaù—offering obeisances; dharmäya—unto one who knows the best of all religion; båhate—the greatest; kåñëäya—unto Kåñëa; akuëöha-medhase—unto one whose brain activity is never checked; puruñäya—the Supreme Person; puräëäya—the oldest of the old; säìkhya-yoga-éçvaräya—the master of the principles of säìkhya-yoga; ca—and.

My dear Lord, You are the topmost of all bestowers of all benediction, the oldest and supreme enjoyer amongst all enjoyers. You are the master of all the worlds' metaphysical philosophy, for You are the supreme cause of all causes, Lord Kåñëa. You are the greatest of all religious principles, the supreme mind, and You have a brain which is never checked by any condition. Therefore I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
The words kåñëäya akuëöha-medhase are significant in this verse. Modern scientists have stopped their brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called aëu, an atomic particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, has a limited brain. What Kåñëa says and does is not limited by time and space. In Bhagavad-gétä (7.26) the Lord says:
vedähaà samatétäni
vartamänäni cärjuna
bhaviñyäëi ca bhütäni
mäà tu veda na kaçcana
"O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows."
Kåñëa knows everything, but one cannot know Kåñëa without being favored by Him. Thus for Kåñëa and His representative there is no question of a theory of uncertainty. What Kåñëa says is all perfect and certain and is applicable to the past, present and future. Nor is there any uncertainty for one who knows exactly what Kåñëa says. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is based on Bhagavad-gétä as it is, as spoken by Lord Kåñëa, and for those who are engaged in this movement, there is no question of uncertainty.
Lord Kåñëa is also addressed herein as äçiñäm éça. The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by Kåñëa, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else. The word manave, meaning "unto the supreme Manu," is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic literature is Sväyambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of Kåñëa. All the Manus are empowered incarnations of Kåñëa (manvantara-avatära). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmä, 420 in one month, 5,040 in one year, and 504,000 Manus in the lifetime of Brahmä. Since all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately Kåñëa is the supreme director of human society. In another sense, the word manave indicates the perfection of all kinds of mantras. The mantra delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance from any condition.
Käraëätmane: everything has a cause. The theory of chance is repudiated in this verse. Because everything has its cause, there is no question of chance. Because so-called philosophers and scientists are unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In Brahma-saàhitä Kåñëa is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as käraëätmane. His very personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything and the seed of everything. As described in the Vedänta-sütra (1.1.2), janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all emanations.
The word säìkhya-yogeçvaräya is also significant herein, for Kåñëa is described in Bhagavad-gétä as Yogeçvara, the master of all mystic powers. Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot be accepted as God. In this Age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only Kåñëa is the Supreme Person who possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The säìkhya-yoga system popular at the present moment was propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original säìkhya-yoga system was propounded by an incarnation of Kåñëa also named Kapila, the son of Devahüti. Similarly, Dattätreya, another incarnation of Kåñëa, also explained the säìkhya-yoga system. Thus Kåñëa is the origin of all säìkhya-yoga systems and mystic yoga powers.
The words puruñäya puräëäya are also worthy of special attention. In Brahma-saàhitä, Kåñëa is accepted as the ädi-puruña, the original person, or the original enjoyer. In Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa is also accepted as puräëa-puruña, the oldest person. Although He is the oldest of all personalities, He is also the youngest of all, or nava-yauvana. Another significant word is dharmäya. Since Kåñëa is the original propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said: dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam (SB 6.3.19). No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established by Lord Kåñëa. In Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa informs us of the original dharma and asks us to give up all kinds of religious principles. The real dharma is surrender unto Him. In the Mahäbhärata, it is also said:
ye ca veda-vido viprä
ye cädhyätma-vido janäù
te vadanti mahätmänaà
kåñëaà dharmaà sanätanam
The purport is that one who has studied the Vedas perfectly, who is a perfect vipra, or knower of the Vedas, who knows what spiritual life actually is, speaks about Kåñëa, the Supreme Person, as one's sanätana-dharma. Lord Çiva therefore teaches us the principles of sanätana-dharma.
TEXT 43
çakti-traya-sametäya
méòhuñe 'haìkåtätmane
ceta-äküti-rüpäya
namo väco vibhütaye


çakti-traya—three kinds of energies; sametäya—unto the reservoir; méòhuñe—unto Rudra; ahaìkåta-ätmane—the source of egotism; cetaù—knowledge; äküti—eagerness to work; rüpäya—unto the form of; namaù—my obeisances; väcaù—unto the sound; vibhütaye—unto the different types of opulences.

My dear Lord, You are the supreme controller of the worker, sense activities and results of sense activities [karma]. Therefore You are the controller of the body, mind and senses. You are also the supreme controller of egotism, known as Rudra. You are the source of knowledge and the activities of the Vedic injunctions.

PURPORT
Everyone acts under the dictation of the ego. Therefore Lord Çiva is trying to purify false egotism through the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Çiva, or Rudra, is himself the controller of egotism, he indirectly wants to be purified by the mercy of the Lord so that his real egotism can be awakened. Of course, Lord Rudra is always spiritually awake, but for our benefit he is praying in this way. For the impersonalist, pure egotism is ahaà brahmäsmi—"I am not this body; I am spirit soul." But in its actual position, the spirit soul has devotional activities to perform. Therefore Lord Çiva prays to be engaged both in mind and in action in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord according to the direction of the Vedas. This is the process for purifying false egotism. Cetaù means "knowledge." Without perfect knowledge, one cannot act perfectly. The real source of knowledge is the väcaù, or sound vibration, given by Vedic instructions. Here the word väcaù, or vibration, means the Vedic vibration. The origin of creation is sound vibration, and if the sound vibration is clear and purified, perfect knowledge and perfect activities actually become manifest. This is enacted by the chanting of the mahä-mantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Thus Lord Çiva is praying again and again for the purification of body, mind and activities through the purification of knowledge and action under the pure directions of the Vedas. Lord Çiva prays to the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that his mind, senses and words will all turn toward devotional activities only.
TEXT 44
darçanaà no didåkñüëäà

darçanam—vision; naù—our; didåkñüëäm—desirous to see; dehi—kindly exhibit; bhägavata—of the devotees; arcitam—as worshiped by them; rüpam—form; priya-tamam—dearmost; svänäm—of Your devotees; sarva-indriya—all the senses; guëa—qualities; aïjanam—very much pleasing.

My dear Lord, I wish to see You exactly in the form that Your very dear devotees worship. You have many other forms, but I wish to see Your form that is especially liked by the devotees. Please be merciful upon me and show me that form, for only that form worshiped by the devotees can perfectly satisfy all the demands of the senses.

PURPORT
In the çruti, or veda-mantra, it is said that the Supreme Absolute Truth is sarva-kämaù sarva-gandhaù sarva-rasaù, or, in other words, He is known as raso vai saù, the source of all relishable relationships (rasas). We have various senses—the powers of seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, etc.—and all the propensities of our senses can be satisfied when the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate: "Bhakti means engaging all the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Håñékeça." (Närada Païcarätra) These material senses, however, cannot be engaged in the service of the Lord; therefore one has to become free from all designations. Sarvopädhi-vinirmuktaà tatparatvena nirmalam [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. One has to become free from all designation or false egotism and thus become purified. When we engage our senses in the service of the Lord, the desires or the inclinations of the senses can be perfectly fulfilled. Lord Çiva therefore wants to see the Lord in a form which is inconceivable to the Bauddha philosophers, or the Buddhists.
The impersonalists and the voidists also have to see the form of the Absolute. In Buddhist temples there are forms of Lord Buddha in meditation, but these are not worshiped like the forms of the Lord in Vaiñëava temples (forms like Rädhä-Kåñëa, Sétä-Räma or Lakñmé-Näräyaëa). Amongst the different sampradäyas (Vaiñëava sects) either Rädhä-Kåñëa or Lakñmé-Näräyaëa is worshiped. Lord Çiva wants to see that form perfectly, just as the devotees want to see it. The words rüpaà priyatamaà svänäm are specifically mentioned here, indicating that Lord Çiva wants to see that form which is very dear to the devotees. The word svänäm is especially significant because only the devotees are very, very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The jïänés, yogés and karmés are not particularly dear, for the karmés simply want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their order supplier. The jïänés want to see Him to become one with Him, and the yogés want to see Him partially represented within their heart as Paramätmä, but the bhaktas, or the devotees, want to see Him in His complete perfection. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä (5.30):
veëuà kvaëantam aravinda-daläyatäkñaà
barhävataàsam asitämbuda-sundaräìgam
kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya-viçeña-çobhaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept at playing on His flute, whose eyes are blooming like lotus petals, whose head is bedecked with peacock feathers, whose beauty is tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and whose unique loveliness charms millions of Cupids." Thus Lord Çiva's desire is to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is described in this way-that is, he wants to see Him as He appears to the bhägavatas, the devotees. The conclusion is that Lord Çiva wants to see Him in complete perfection and not in the impersonalist or voidist way. Although the Lord is one in His various forms (advaitam acyutam anädim), still His form as the young enjoyer of the gopés and companion of the cowherd boys (kiçora-mürti) is the most perfect form. Thus Vaiñëavas accept the form of the Lord in His Våndävana pastimes as the chief form.

The Lord's beauty resembles a dark cloud during the rainy season. As the rainfall glistens, His bodily features also glisten. Indeed, He is the sum total of all beauty. The Lord has four arms and an exquisitely beautiful face with eyes like lotus petals, a beautiful highly raised nose, a mind-attracting smile, a beautiful forehead and equally beautiful and fully decorated ears.

PURPORT
After the scorching heat of the summer season, it is very pleasing to see dark clouds in the sky. As confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä: barhävataàsam asitämbuda-sundaräìgam. The Lord wears a peacock feather in His hair, and His bodily complexion is just like a blackish cloud. The word sundara, or snigdha, means "very pleasing." Kandarpa-koöi-kamanéya. Kåñëa's beauty is so pleasing that not even millions upon millions of Cupids can compare to it. The Lord's form as Viñëu is decorated in all opulence; therefore Lord Çiva is trying to see that most opulent form of Näräyaëa, or Viñëu. Generally the worship of the Lord begins with the worship of Näräyaëa, or Viñëu, whereas the worship of Lord Kåñëa and Rädhä is most confidential. Lord Näräyaëa is worshipable by the päïcarätrika-vidhi, or regulative principles, whereas Lord Kåñëa is worshipable by the bhägavata-vidhi. No one can worship the Lord in the bhägavata-vidhi without going through the regulations of the päïcarätrika-vidhi. Actually, neophyte devotees worship the Lord according to the päïcarätrika-vidhi, or the regulative principles enjoined in the Närada Païcarätra. Rädhä-Kåñëa cannot be approached by the neophyte devotees; therefore temple worship according to regulative principles is offered to Lakñmé-Näräyaëa. Although there may be a Rädhä-Kåñëa vigraha, or form, the worship of the neophyte devotees is acceptable as Lakñmé-Näräyaëa worship. Worship according to the päïcarätrika-vidhi is called vidhi-märga, and worship according to the bhägavata-vidhi principles is called räga-märga. The principles of räga-märga are especially meant for devotees who are elevated to the Våndävana platform.
The inhabitants of Våndävana—the gopés, Mother Yaçodä, Nanda Mahäräja, the cowherd boys, the cows and everyone else—are actually on the räga-märga or bhägavata-märga platform. They participate in five basic rasas-däsya, sakhya, vätsalya, mädhurya and çänta. But although these five rasas are found in the bhägavata-märga, the bhägavata-märga is especially meant for vätsalya and mädhurya, or parental and conjugal relationships. Yet there is the viçrambha-sakhya, the higher fraternal worship of the Lord especially enjoyed by the cowherd boys. Although there is friendship between Kåñëa and the cowherd boys, this friendship is different from the aiçvarya friendship between Kåñëa and Arjuna. When Arjuna saw the viçva-rüpa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord, he was afraid for having treated Kåñëa as an ordinary friend; therefore he begged Kåñëa's pardon. However, the cowherd boys who are friends of Kåñëa in Våndävana sometimes ride on the shoulders of Kåñëa. They treat Kåñëa equally, just as they treat one another, and they are never afraid of Him, nor do they ever beg His pardon. Thus the räga-märga, or bhägavata-märga, friendship exists on a higher platform with Kåñëa, namely the platform of viçrambha friendship. Parental friendship, parental service and conjugal service are visible in the Våndävana räga-märga relationships.
Without serving Kåñëa according to the vidhi-märga regulative principles of the päïcarätrika-vidhi, unscrupulous persons want to jump immediately to the räga-märga principles. Such persons are called sahajiyä. There are also demons who enjoy depicting Kåñëa and His pastimes with the gopés, taking advantage of Kåñëa by their licentious character. These demons who print books and write lyrics on the räga-märga principles are surely on the way to hell. Unfortunately, they lead others down with them. Devotees in Kåñëa consciousness should be very careful to avoid such demons. One should strictly follow the vidhi-märga regulative principles in the worship of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, although the Lord is present in the temple as Rädhä-Kåñëa. Rädhä-Kåñëa includes Lakñmé-Näräyaëa; therefore when one worships the Lord according to the regulative principles, the Lord accepts the service in the role of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa. In The Nectar of Devotion full instructions are given about the vidhi-märga worship of Rädhä-Kåñëa, or Lakñmé-Näräyaëa. Although there are sixty-four kinds of offenses one can commit in vidhi-märga worship, in räga-märga worship there is no consideration of such offenses because the devotees on that platform are very much elevated, and there is no question of offense. But if we do not follow the regulative principles on the vidhi-märga platform and keep our eyes trained to spot offenses, we will not make progress.
In his description of Kåñëa's beauty, Lord Çiva uses the words cärväyata-catur-bähu sujäta-ruciränanam, indicating the beautiful four-armed form of Näräyaëa, or Viñëu. Those who worship Lord Kåñëa describe Him as sujäta-ruciränanam. In the viñëu-tattva there are hundreds and thousands and millions of forms of the Supreme Lord, but of all these forms, the form of Kåñëa is the most beautiful. Thus for those who worship Kåñëa, the word sujäta-ruciränanam is used.
The four arms of Lord Viñëu have different purposes. The hands holding a lotus flower and conchshell are meant for the devotees, whereas the other two hands, holding a disc and mace, or club, are meant for the demons. Actually all of the Lord's arms are auspicious, whether they are holding conchshells and flowers or clubs and discs. The demons killed by Lord Viñëu's cakra disc and club are elevated to the spiritual world, just like the devotees who are protected by the hands holding the lotus flower and conchshell. However, the demons who are elevated to the spiritual world are situated in the impersonal Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are allowed to enter into the Vaikuëöha planets. Those who are devotees of Lord Kåñëa are immediately elevated to the Goloka Våndävana planet.
The Lord's beauty is compared to rainfall because when the rain falls in the rainy season, it becomes more and more pleasing to the people. After the scorching heat of the summer season, the people enjoy the rainy season very much. Indeed, they even come out of their doors in the villages and enjoy the rainfall directly. Thus the Lord's bodily features are compared to the clouds of the rainy season. The devotees enjoy the Lord's beauty because it is a collection of all kinds of beauties. Therefore the word sarva-saundarya-saìgraham is used. No one can say that the body of the Lord is wanting in beautiful parts. It is completely pürëam. Everything is complete: God's creation, God's beauty and God's bodily features. All these are so complete that all one's desires can become fully satisfied when one sees the beauty of the Lord. The word sarva-saundarya indicates that there are different types of beauties in the material and spiritual worlds and that the Lord contains all of them. Both materialists and spiritualists can enjoy the beauty of the Lord. Because the Supreme Lord attracts everyone, including demons and devotees, materialists and spiritualists, He is called Kåñëa. Similarly, His devotees also attract everyone. As mentioned in the Sad-gosvämé-stotra: dhérädhéra-jana-priyau—the Gosvämés are equally dear to the dhéra (devotees) and adhéra (demons). Lord Kåñëa was not very pleasing to the demons when He was present in Våndävana, but the Six Gosvämés were pleasing to the demons when they were present in Våndävana. That is the beauty of the Lord's dealings with His devotees; sometimes the Lord gives more credit to His devotees than He takes for Himself. For instance, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, Lord Kåñëa fought simply by giving directions. Yet it was Arjuna who took the credit for fighting. Nimitta-mätraà bhava savyasäcin: "You, O Savyasäcé [Arjuna], can be but an instrument in the fight." (Bg. 11.33) Everything was arranged by the Lord, but the credit of victory was given to Arjuna. Similarly, in the Kåñëa consciousness movement, everything is happening according to the predictions of Lord Caitanya, but the credit goes to Lord Caitanya's sincere servants. Thus the Lord is described herein as sarva-saundarya-saìgraham.

The Lord is superexcellently beautiful on account of His open and merciful smile and His sidelong glance upon His devotees. His black hair is curly, and His garments, waving in the wind, appear like flying saffron pollen from lotus flowers. His glittering earrings, shining helmet, bangles, garland, ankle bells, waist belt and various other bodily ornaments combine with conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower to increase the natural beauty of the Kaustubha pearl on His chest.

PURPORT
The word prahasitäpäìga, referring to Kåñëa's smile and sidelong glances at His devotees, specifically applies to His dealings with the gopés. Kåñëa is always in a joking mood when He increases the feelings of conjugal rasa in the hearts of the gopés. The conchshell, club, disc and lotus flower can be either held in His hands or seen on the palms of His hands. According to palmistry, the signs of a conchshell, club, lotus flower and disc mark the palms of great personalities and especially indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Besides these, there is the beauty of the Kaustubha-maëi pearl, and on the dark chest of the Lord there are streaks named Çrévatsa, which are signs of the goddess of fortune. The glittering of these streaks excels the beauty of the golden streaks on a gold-testing stone. Indeed, such beauty defeats a gold-testing stone.

PURPORT
The curling hair on the shoulders of a lion always appears very, very beautiful. Similarly, the shoulders of the Lord were just like a lion's, and the necklace and garlands, along with the Kaustubha pearl necklace, combined to excel the beauty of a lion. The chest of the Lord is streaked with Çrévatsa lines, the sign of the goddess of fortune. Consequently the Lord's chest excels the beauty of a testing stone for gold. The black siliceous stone on which gold is rubbed to test its value always looks very beautiful, being streaked with gold lines. Yet the chest of the Lord excels even such a stone in its beauty.

The Lord's abdomen is beautiful due to three ripples in the flesh. Being so round, His abdomen resembles the leaf of a banyan tree, and when He exhales and inhales, the movement of the ripples appears very, very beautiful. The coils within the navel of the Lord are so deep that it appears that the entire universe sprouted out of it and yet again wishes to go back.

PURPORT
The whole universe is born out of the lotus stem which sprouted from the navel of the Lord. Lord Brahmä sat on the top of this lotus stem to create the whole universe. The navel of the Lord is so deep and coiling that it appears that the whole universe again wants to withdraw into the navel, being attracted by the Lord's beauty. The Lord's navel and the ripples on His belly always increase the beauty of His bodily features. The details of the bodily features of the Lord especially indicate the Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists cannot appreciate the beautiful body of the Lord, which is described in these prayers by Lord Çiva. Although the impersonalists are always engaged in the worship of Lord Çiva, they are unable to understand the prayers offered by Lord Çiva to the bodily features of Lord Viñëu. Lord Viñëu is known as çiva-viriïci-nutam (SB 11.5.33), for He is always worshiped by Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva.

The lower part of the Lord's waist is dark and covered with yellow garments and a belt bedecked with golden embroidery work. His symmetrical lotus feet and the calves, thighs and joints of His legs are extraordinarily beautiful. Indeed, the Lord's entire body appears to be well built.

PURPORT
Lord Çiva is one of the twelve great authorities mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.3.20). These authorities are Svayambhü, Närada, Çambhu, Kumära, Kapila, Manu, Prahläda, Janaka, Bhéñma, Bali, Vaiyäsaki, or Çukadeva Gosvämé, and Yamaräja. The impersonalists, who generally worship Lord Çiva, should learn of the transcendental sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1] of the Lord. Here Lord Çiva kindly describes the details of the Lord's bodily features. Thus the impersonalists' argument that the Lord has no form cannot be accepted under any circumstance.

My dear Lord, Your two lotus feet are so beautiful that they appear like two blossoming petals of the lotus flower which grows during the autumn season. Indeed, the nails of Your lotus feet emanate such a great effulgence that they immediately dissipate all the darkness in the heart of a conditioned soul. My dear Lord, kindly show me that form of Yours which always dissipates all kinds of darkness in the heart of a devotee. My dear Lord, You are the supreme spiritual master of everyone; therefore all conditioned souls covered with the darkness of ignorance can be enlightened by You as the spiritual master.

PURPORT
Lord Çiva has thus described the bodily features of the Lord authoritatively. Now he wants to see the lotus feet of the Lord. When a devotee wants to see the transcendental form of the Lord, he begins his meditation on the Lord's body by first looking at the feet of the Lord. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is considered to be the transcendental sound form of the Lord, and the twelve cantos are divided in accordance with the transcendental form of the Lord. The First and Second Cantos of Çrémad-Bhägavatam are called the two lotus feet of the Lord. It is therefore suggested by Lord Çiva that one should first try to see the lotus feet of the Lord. This also means that if one is serious about reading Çrémad-Bhägavatam, he must begin by seriously studying the First and Second Cantos.
The beauty of the lotus feet of the Lord is compared to the petals of a lotus flower which grows in the autumn season. By nature's law, in autumn the dirty or muddy waters of rivers and lakes become very clean. At that time the lotus flowers growing in the lakes appear very bright and beautiful. The lotus flower itself is compared to the lotus feet of the Lord, and the petals are compared to the nails of the feet of the Lord. The nails of the feet of the Lord are very bright, as Brahma-saàhitä testifies. Änanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya: [Bs. 5.32] every limb of the transcendental body of the Lord is made of änanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala. Thus every limb is eternally bright. As sunshine dissipates the darkness of this material world, the effulgence emanating from the body of the Lord immediately dries up the darkness in the heart of the conditioned soul. In other words, everyone serious about understanding the transcendental science and seeing the transcendental form of the Lord must first of all attempt to see the lotus feet of the Lord by studying the First and Second Cantos of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. When one sees the lotus feet of the Lord, all kinds of doubts and fears within the heart are vanquished.
In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that in order to make spiritual progress, one must become fearless. Abhayaà sattva-saàçuddhiù (Bg. 16.1). Fearfulness is the result of material involvement. It is also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.2.37), bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät: fearfulness is a creation of the bodily conception of life. As long as one is absorbed in the thought that he is this material body, he is fearful, and as soon as one is freed from this material conception, he becomes brahma-bhüta [SB 4.30.20], or self-realized, and immediately becomes fearless. Brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä (Bg. 18.54). Without being fearless, one cannot be joyful. The bhaktas, the devotees, are fearless and always joyful because they are constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is also said:
evaà prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogataù
bhagavat-tattva-vijïänaà
mukta-saìgasya jäyate
(SB 1.2.20)
By practicing bhagavad-bhakti-yoga, one becomes fearless and joyful. Unless one becomes fearless and joyful, he cannot understand the science of God. Bhagavat-tattva-vijïänaà mukta-saìgasya jäyate. This verse refers to those who are completely liberated from the fearfulness of this material world. When one is so liberated, he can really understand the transcendental features of the form of the Lord. Lord Çiva therefore advises everyone to practice bhagavad-bhakti-yoga. As will be clear in the following verses, by doing so one can become really liberated and enjoy spiritual bliss.
It is also stated:
oà ajïäna-timirändhasya
jïänäïjana-çaläkayä
cakñur unmélitaà yena
tasmai çré-gurave namaù
The Lord is the supreme spiritual master, and the bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord is also a spiritual master. The Lord from within enlightens the devotees by the effulgence of the nails of His lotus feet, and His representative, the spiritual master, enlightens from without. Only by thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord and always taking the spiritual master's advice can one advance in spiritual life and understand Vedic knowledge.
yasya deve parä bhaktir
yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù
prakäçante mahätmanaù
 [ÇU  6.23]
Thus the Vedas (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.23) enjoin that for one who has unflinching faith in the lotus feet of the Lord, as well as in the spiritual master, the real import of Vedic knowledge can be revealed.
TEXT 53
etad rüpam anudhyeyam
ätma-çuddhim abhépsatäm
yad-bhakti-yogo 'bhayadaù
sva-dharmam anutiñöhatäm


etat—this; rüpam—form; anudhyeyam—must be meditated upon; ätma—self; çuddhim—purification; abhépsatäm—of those who are desiring so; yat—that which; bhakti-yogaù—the devotional service; abhaya-daù—factual fearlessness; sva-dharmam—one's own occupational duties; anutiñöhatäm—executing.

My dear Lord, those who desire to purify their existence must always engage in meditation upon Your lotus feet, as described above. Those who are serious about executing their occupational duties and who want freedom from fear must take to this process of bhakti-yoga.

PURPORT
It is said that the transcendental name, form, pastimes and entourage of the Lord cannot be appreciated by the blunt material senses; therefore one has to engage himself in devotional service so that the senses may be purified and one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here, however, it is indicated that those who are constantly engaged in meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord are certainly purified of the material contamination of the senses and are thus able to see the Supreme Lord face to face. The word "meditation" is very popular in this age amongst the common people, but they do not know the actual meaning of meditation. However, from Vedic literature we learn that the yogés are always absorbed in meditation upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä paçyanti yaà yoginaù (SB 12.13.1). This is the real business of the yogés: to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Çiva therefore advises that one who is actually serious about purification must engage himself in this type of meditation or in the mystic yoga system, which will help him not only to see the Lord within constantly but to see Him face to face and become His associate in Vaikuëöhaloka or Goloka Våndävana.
The word sva-dharmam (as in sva-dharmam anutiñöhatäm) indicates that the system of varëäçrama—which indicates the occupational duties of the brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra and which is the perfect institution for humanity—must be supported by bhakti-yoga if one at all wants security in life. Generally people think that simply by executing the occupational duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra or the duty of a brahmacäré, gåhastha, vänaprastha or sannyäsé one becomes fearless or securely attains liberation, but factually unless all these occupational duties are accompanied by bhakti-yoga, one cannot become fearless. In Bhagavad-gétä there are descriptions of karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, bhakti-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, etc., but unless one comes to the point of bhakti-yoga, these other yogas cannot help one attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, bhakti-yoga is the only means for liberation. We find this conclusion also in Caitanya-caritämåta in a discussion between Lord Caitanya and Rämänanda Räya regarding a human being's liberation from this material world. In that discussion Rämänanda Räya referred to the execution of varëäçrama-dharma, and Lord Caitanya indicated that the varëäçrama-dharma was simply external (eho bähya). Lord Caitanya wanted to impress upon Rämänanda Räya that simply by executing the duties of varëäçrama-dharma one is not guaranteed liberation. Finally Rämänanda Räya referred to the process of bhakti-yoga: sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhiù (SB 10.14.3). Regardless of one's condition of life, if he practices bhakti-yoga, which begins with hearing (çruti-gatäm) the transcendental messages of the Lord through the mouths of devotees, he gradually conquers the unconquerable God.
God is known to be unconquerable, but one who submissively hears the words of a self-realized soul conquers the unconquerable. The conclusion is that if one is serious about liberation, he not only should execute the occupational duties of varëäçrama-dharma but should also engage in bhakti-yoga by beginning hearing from a realized soul. This process will help the devotee conquer the unconquerable Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His associate after giving up the material body.

bhavän bhaktimatä labhyo

bhavän—Your Grace; bhakti-matä—by the devotee; labhyaù—obtainable; durlabhaù—very difficult to be obtained; sarva-dehinäm—of all other living entities; sväräjyasya—of the king of heaven; api—even; abhimataù—the ultimate goal; ekäntena—by oneness; ätma-vit—of the self-realized; gatiù—the ultimate destination.

My dear Lord, the king in charge of the heavenly kingdom is also desirous of obtaining the ultimate goal of life-devotional service. Similarly, You are the ultimate destination of those who identify themselves with You [ahaà brahmäsmi]. However, it is very difficult for them to attain You, whereas a devotee can very easily attain Your Lordship.

PURPORT
As stated in Brahma-saàhitä: vedeñu durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau [Bs. 5.33]. This indicates that it is very difficult for one to attain the ultimate goal of life and reach the supreme destination, Vaikuëöhaloka or Goloka Våndävana, simply by studying Vedänta philosophy or Vedic literature. However, this highest perfectional stage can be attained by the devotees very easily. That is the meaning of vedeñu durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau. The same point is confirmed by Lord Çiva in this verse. The Lord is very difficult for the karma-yogés, jïäna-yogés and dhyäna-yogés to attain. Those who are bhakti-yogés, however, have no difficulty at all. In the word sväräjyasya, svar refers to Svargaloka, the heavenly planet, and sväräjya refers to the ruler of the heavenly planet, Indra. Generally, karmés desire elevation to heavenly planets, but King Indra desires to become perfect in bhakti-yoga. Those who identify themselves as ahaà brahmäsmi ("I am the Supreme Brahman, one with the Absolute Truth") also ultimately desire to attain perfect liberation in the Vaikuëöha planets or Goloka Våndävana. In Bhagavad-gétä (18.55) it is said:
bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti
yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù
tato mäà tattvato jïätvä
viçate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."
Thus if one desires to enter into the spiritual world, he must try to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by practicing bhakti-yoga. Simply by practicing bhakti-yoga one can understand the Supreme Lord in truth, but without such understanding, one cannot enter the spiritual kingdom. One may be elevated to the heavenly planets or may realize himself as Brahman (ahaà brahmäsmi), but that is not the end of realization. One must realize the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by bhakti-yoga; then real perfection of life is attained.

tam—unto You; durärädhyam—very difficult to worship; ärädhya—having worshiped; satäm api—even for the most exalted persons; duräpayä—very difficult to attain; ekänta—pure; bhaktyä—by devotional service; kaù—who is that man; väïchet—should desire; päda-mülam—lotus feet; vinä—without; bahiù—outsiders.

My dear Lord, pure devotional service is even difficult for liberated persons to discharge, but devotional service alone can satisfy You. Who will take to other processes of self-realization if he is actually serious about the perfection of life?

PURPORT
The word satäm refers to transcendentalists. There are three kinds of transcendentalists: the jïäné, yogé and bhakta. Out of these three, the bhakta is selected as the most suitable candidate to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is emphasized herein that only one who is outside devotional service would not engage in searching for the lotus feet of the Lord. Foolish people sometimes maintain that God may be attained in any way—either by karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, etc.—but here it is clearly stated that it is impossible to obtain the mercy of the Lord by any means but bhakti-yoga. The word durärädhya is especially significant. It is very difficult to attain the lotus feet of the Lord by any method other than bhakti-yoga.
TEXT 56

Simply by expansion of his eyebrows, invincible time personified can immediately vanquish the entire universe. However, formidable time does not approach the devotee who has taken complete shelter at Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä (10.34) it is said that the Lord in the shape and form of death destroys all a person's possessions. Måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: "I am all-devouring death." The Lord in the shape of death takes away everything that is created by the conditioned soul. Everything in this material world is subject to perish in due course of time. However, all the strength of time cannot hamper the activities of a devotee, for a devotee takes complete shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord. For this reason only is a devotee free from formidable time. All the activities of the karmés and jïänés, which have no touch of devotional service, are spoiled in due course of time. The material success of the karmés is destined to be destroyed; similarly, the impersonal realization attained by the jïänés is also destroyed in the course of time.
äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù
patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù
(SB 10.2.32)
To say nothing of the karmés, the jïänés undergo severe austerities to attain the impersonal brahma-jyoti, but because they do not find the lotus feet of the Lord, they fall down again into this material existence. Unless one is fully situated in unalloyed devotional service, there is no guarantee of liberation, even if one is elevated to the heavenly planets or to the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee's achievement, however, is never lost by the influence of time. Even if a devotee cannot completely execute devotional service, in his next life he begins from the point where he left off. Such an opportunity is not given to the karmés and jïänés, whose achievements are destroyed. The bhakta's achievement is never destroyed, for it goes on perpetually, be it complete or incomplete. This is the verdict of all Vedic literatures. Çucénäà çrématäà gehe yoga-bhrañöo'bhijäyate [Bg. 6.41]. If one is unable to complete the process of bhakti-yoga, he is given a chance in his next life to take birth in a pure family of devotees or in a rich family. In such families a person can have a good opportunity to further progress in devotional service.
When Yamaräja, the superintendent of death, was instructing his assistants, he told them not to approach the devotees. "The devotees should be offered respect," he said, "but do not go near them." Thus the devotees of the Lord are not under the jurisdiction of Yamaräja. Yamaräja is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he controls the death of every living entity. Yet he has nothing to do with the devotees. Simply by blinking his eyes, time personified can destroy the entire cosmic manifestation, but he has nothing to do with the devotee. In other words, devotional service which is rendered by the devotee in this lifetime can never be destroyed by time. Such spiritual assets remain unchanged, being beyond the influence of time.
TEXT 57
kñaëärdhenäpi tulaye

kñaëa-ardhena—by half a moment; api—even; tulaye—compare; na—never; svargam—heavenly planets; na—neither; apunaù-bhavam—merging into the Supreme; bhagavat—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; saìgi—associate; saìgasya—one who takes advantage of associating; martyänäm—of the conditioned soul; kim uta—what is there; äçiñaù—blessings.

If one by chance associates with a devotee, even for a fraction of a moment, he no longer is subject to attraction by the results of karma or jïäna. What interest then can he have in the benedictions of the demigods, who are subject to the laws of birth and death?

PURPORT
Out of three kinds of men—the karmés, jïänés and bhaktas—the bhakta is described herein as the most exalted. Çréla Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté has sung: kaivalyaà narakäyate tridaça-pür äkäça-puñpäyate (Caitanya-candrämåta). The word kaivalya means to merge into the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the word tridaça-pür refers to the heavenly planets where the demigods live. Thus for a devotee, kaivalya-sukha, or merging into the existence of the Lord, is hellish because the bhakta considers it suicidal to lose his individuality and merge into the effulgence of Brahman. A bhakta always wants to retain his individuality in order to render service to the Lord. Indeed, he considers promotion to the upper planetary systems to be no better than a will-o'-the-wisp. Temporary, material happiness holds no value for a devotee. The devotee is in such an exalted position that he is not interested in the actions of karma or jïäna. The resultant actions of karma and jïäna are so insignificant to a devotee situated on the transcendental platform that he is not in the least interested in them. Bhakti-yoga is sufficient to give the bhakta all happiness. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.6): yayätmä suprasédati. One can be fully satisfied simply by devotional service, and that is the result of association with a devotee. Without being blessed by a pure devotee, no one can be fully satisfied, nor can anyone understand the transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My dear Lord, Your lotus feet are the cause of all auspicious things and the destroyer of all the contamination of sin. I therefore beg Your Lordship to bless me by the association of Your devotees, who are completely purified by worshiping Your lotus feet and who are so merciful upon the conditioned souls. I think that Your real benediction will be to allow me to associate with such devotees.

PURPORT
The Ganges water is celebrated as being able to eradicate all kinds of sinful reactions. In other words, when a person takes his bath in the Ganges, he becomes freed from all life's contaminations. The Ganges water is celebrated in this way because it emanates from the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, those who are directly in touch with the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who are absorbed in the chanting of His glories are freed from all material contamination. Such unalloyed devotees are able to show mercy to the common conditioned soul. Çréla Våndävana däsa Öhäkura has sung that the devotees of Lord Caitanya are so powerful that each one of them can deliver a universe. In other words, it is the business of devotees to preach the glories of the Lord and deliver all conditioned souls to the platform of çuddha-sattva, pure goodness. Here the word su-sattva means çuddha-sattva, the transcendental stage beyond material goodness. By his exemplary prayers, Lord Çiva teaches us that our best course is to take shelter of Lord Viñëu and His Vaiñëava devotees.

The devotee whose heart has been completely cleansed by the process of devotional service and who is favored by Bhaktidevé does not become bewildered by the external energy, which is just like a dark well. Being completely cleansed of all material contamination in this way, a devotee is able to understand very happily Your name, fame, form, activities, etc.

PURPORT
As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.25.25):
satäà prasaìgän mama vérya-saàvido
bhavanti håt-karëa-rasäyanäù kathäù
taj-joñaëäd äçv apavarga-vartmani
çraddhä ratir bhaktir anukramiñyati
Simply by the association of pure devotees one can understand the transcendental name, fame, quality and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has repeatedly said:
'sädhu-saìga', 'sädhu-saìga'—sarva-çästre kaya
lava-mätra sädhu-saìge sarva-siddhi haya
(Cc. Madhya 22.54)
Simply by associating with a pure devotee, one becomes wonderfully advanced in Kåñëa consciousness. Sädhu-saìga, or association with a devotee, means always engaging in Kåñëa consciousness by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra and by acting for Kåñëa. Specifically, chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra purifies one, and this chanting is therefore recommended by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Ceto-darpaëa-märjanam: [Cc. Antya 20.12] by chanting the names of Kåñëa, the mirror of the heart is cleansed, and the devotee loses interest in everything external. When one is influenced by the external energy of the Lord, his heart is impure. When one's heart is not pure, he cannot see how things are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Idaà hi viçvaà bhagavän ivetaraù (SB 1.5.20). He whose heart is purified can see that the whole cosmic manifestation is but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he whose heart is contaminated sees things differently. Therefore by sat-saìga, or association with devotees, one becomes perfectly pure in heart.
One who is pure in heart is never attracted by the external energy, which urges the individual soul to try to dominate material nature. The pure heart of a devotee is never disturbed when he executes devotional service in the form of hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. In all, there are nine processes one can follow in the execution of devotional service. In any case, a pure-hearted devotee is never disturbed. The bhakti-yoga process must be carried out by avoiding the ten offenses one can commit while chanting the mahä-mantra and the sixty-four offenses one can commit while worshiping the Deity. When a devotee strictly follows the rules and regulations, Bhaktidevé becomes very much satisfied with him, and at that time he is never disturbed by anything external. A devotee is also called a muni. The word muni means "thoughtful." A devotee is as thoughtful as a nondevotee is speculative. The nondevotee's speculation is impure, but a devotee's thoughts are pure. Lord Kapila and Çukadeva Gosvämé are also called muni, and Vyäsadeva is addressed as Mahämuni. A devotee is addressed as muni, or thoughtful, when he purely understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that when one's heart is purified by the association of devotees and by the avoidance of the offenses committed when chanting and worshiping the Lord, the transcendental name, form and activities of the Lord are revealed by the Lord.
TEXT 60
yatredaà vyajyate viçvaà
viçvasminn avabhäti yat
tat tvaà brahma paraà jyotir
äkäçam iva viståtam


yatra—where; idam—this; vyajyate—manifested; viçvam—the universe; viçvasmin—in the cosmic manifestation; avabhäti—is manifested; yat—that; tat—that; tvam—You; brahma—the impersonal Brahman; param—transcendental; jyotiù—effulgence; äkäçam—sky; iva—like; viståtam—spread.

My dear Lord, the impersonal Brahman spreads everywhere, like the sunshine or the sky. And that impersonal Brahman, which spreads throughout the universe and in which the entire universe is manifested, is You.

PURPORT
In Vedic literature it is said that everything is Brahman and nothing else. The whole cosmic manifestation rests on the Brahman effulgence. The impersonalists, however, cannot understand how such a huge cosmic manifestation can rest on a person. Thus this inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not understood by the impersonalists; therefore they are puzzled and always denying that the Absolute Truth is a person. This wrong impression is cleared by Lord Çiva himself, who says that the impersonal Brahman, which is spread all over the universe, is nothing but the Supreme Lord Himself. Here it is clearly said that the Lord is spread everywhere, just like the sunshine, by virtue of His Brahman feature. This example is very easy to understand. All the planetary systems are resting upon the sunshine, yet the sunshine and the source of sunshine are aloof from the planetary manifestations. Similarly, the sky or air is spread everywhere; air is within a pot, but it also touches filthy places and sanctified places alike. In any case, the sky is uncontaminated. The sunshine also touches filthy places and sanctified places, and both are actually produced by the sun, but in any case the sun is aloof from all filthy things. Similarly, the Lord exists everywhere. There are pious things and impious things, but in the çästras the pious things are described as the front of the Supreme Lord, whereas impious things are described as the back of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä (9.4) the Lord clearly says:
mayä tatam idaà sarvaà
jagad avyakta-mürtinä
mat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni
na cähaà teñv avasthitaù
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them."
This verse of Bhagavad-gétä explains that the Lord is spread everywhere by virtue of His Brahman feature. Everything rests in Him, yet He is not there. The conclusion is that without bhakti-yoga, without rendering devotional service to the Lord, even an impersonalist cannot understand the brahma-tattva, the Brahman feature. In the Vedänta-sütra it is stated: athäto brahma jijïäsä. This means that Brahman, Paramätmä or Para-brahman should be understood. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam also the Absolute Truth is described as the one without a second, but He is realized in three features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate issue, and in this verse Lord Çiva confirms that ultimately the Absolute Truth is a person. He clearly says: tat tvaà brahma paraà jyotir äkäçam iva viståtam. Here is a common example: a successful businessman may have many factories and offices, and everything rests on his order. If someone says that the entire business rests on such-and-such a person, it does not mean that the person is bearing all the factories and offices on his head. Rather, it is understood that by his brain or his energetic expansion, the business is running without interruption. Similarly, it is the brain and energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that carry on the complete manifestation of the material and spiritual worlds. The philosophy of monism, explained here very clearly, adjusts itself to the fact that the supreme source of all energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. This is described very clearly. It is also stated how the impersonal feature of Kåñëa can be understood:
raso 'ham apsu kaunteya
prabhäsmi çaçi-süryayoù
praëavaù sarva-vedeñu
çabdaù khe pauruñaà nåñu
"O son of Kunté [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and moon, the syllable oà in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man." (Bg. 7.8)
In this way Kåñëa can be understood as the mystic power in everything.

yaù—one who; mäyayä—by His energy; idam—this; puru—manifold; rüpayä—manifestation; asåjat—created; bibharti—maintains; bhüyaù—again; kñapayati—annihilates; avikriyaù—without being altered; yat—that; bheda-buddhiù—sense of differentiation; sat—eternal; iva—like; ätma-duùsthayä—giving trouble to oneself; tvam—unto You; ätma-tantram—fully self-independent; bhagavan—O Lord, Supreme Personality of Godhead; pratémahi—I can understand.

My dear Lord, You have manifold energies, and these energies are manifested in manifold forms. With such energies You have also created this cosmic manifestation, and although You maintain it as if it were permanent, You ultimately annihilate it. Although You are never disturbed by such changes and alterations, the living entities are disturbed by them, and therefore they find the cosmic manifestation to be different or separated from You. My Lord, You are always independent, and I can clearly see this fact.

PURPORT
It is clearly explained that Lord Kåñëa has multienergies, which can be grouped into three: namely the external energy, the internal energy and the marginal energy. There are also different cosmic manifestations—namely the spiritual world and the material world—as well as different types of living entities. Some living entities are conditioned, and others are eternally free. The eternally free living entities are called nitya-mukta, for they never come in contact with the material energy. However, some living entities are conditioned in this material world, and thus they think themselves separated from the Supreme Lord. Due to their contact with the material energy, their existence is always troublesome. Being always in distress, the conditioned soul considers the material energy to be very much disturbing. This fact is explained by a Vaiñëava kavi, or poet:
kåñëa bhuli' sei jéva anädi-bahirmukha
ataeva mäyä täre deya saàsära-duùkha
  [Cc. Madhya 20.117]
When the living entity forgets the Supreme Lord and wants to enjoy himself independently, imitating the Supreme Lord, he is captured by the false notion that he is the enjoyer and is separated from the Supreme Lord. This material energy is therefore very much troublesome to the spiritual energy, the living entity, but the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. Indeed, for the Supreme Lord, both material and spiritual energy are the same. In this verse Lord Çiva explains that the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always independent, but because the living entities are not independent—due to their false idea of becoming independently happy—the material energy is troublesome. Consequently the material energy creates differentiation.
Because the Mäyävädé philosophers cannot understand this, they want to be relieved from the material energy. However, because a Vaiñëava philosopher is in full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he finds no disturbance even in the material energy. This is because he knows how to utilize the material energy for the service of the Lord. In the government, the criminal department and civil department may appear different in the eyes of the citizens, but in the eyes of the government both departments are one and the same. The criminal department is troublesome for the criminal but not for the obedient citizen. Similarly, this material energy is troublesome for the conditioned soul, but it has nothing to do with the liberated souls who are engaged in the service of the Lord. Through the puruña-avatära Mahä-Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead created the whole cosmic manifestation. Simply by breathing out all the universes, the Lord creates and maintains the cosmic manifestation as Lord Viñëu. Then as Saìkarñaëa, He annihilates the cosmic manifestation. Yet despite the creation, maintenance and destruction of the cosmos, the Lord is not affected. The various activities of the Lord must be very disturbing to the tiny living entities, but since the Lord is supremely great, He is never affected. Lord Çiva or any other pure devotee can see this clearly without being blinded by bheda-buddhi, or differentiation. For a devotee, the Lord is the supreme spirit soul. Since He is supremely powerful, His various powers are also spiritual. For a devotee, there is nothing material, for material existence only means forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

kriyä—activities; kaläpaiù—by processes; idam—this; eva—certainly; yoginaù—transcendentalists; çraddhä-anvitäù—with faith and conviction; sädhu—properly; yajanti—worship; siddhaye—for perfection; bhüta—the material energy; indriya—senses; antaù-karaëa—heart; upalakñitam—symptomized by; vede—in the Vedas; ca—also; tantre—in the corollaries of the Vedas; ca—also; te—Your Lordship; eva—certainly; kovidäù—those who are experts.

My dear Lord, Your universal form consists of all five elements, the senses, mind, intelligence, false ego (which is material) and the Paramätmä, Your partial expansion, who is the director of everything. Yogis other than the devotees—namely the karma-yogé and jïäna-yogé—worship You by their respective actions in their respective positions. It is stated both in the Vedas and in the çästras that are corollaries of the Vedas, and indeed everywhere, that it is only You who are to be worshiped. That is the expert version of all the Vedas.

PURPORT
In a previous verse Lord Çiva wanted to see the form of the Lord which the devotees are always interested in. There are other forms of the Lord manifest in the material world, including Brahmä and other demigods, and these are worshiped by materialistic persons. In the Second Canto, Third Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, it is stated that those who desire material benefits are recommended to worship different types of demigods, and in conclusion the Bhägavatam recommends:
akämaù sarva-kämo vä
mokña-käma udära-dhéù
tévreëa bhakti-yogena
yajeta puruñaà param
(SB 2.3.10)
The devotees, the jïänés, who are known as mokña-käma, and the karmés, who are known as sarva-käma, are all aspiring to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. Even when one performs yajïas, as stated here (kriyä-kaläpaiù), he should always remember that the demigods are but agents of the Supreme Lord. Actually the worshipful Lord is Viñëu, Yajïeçvara. Thus even when different demigods are worshiped in the Vedic and Tantric sacrifices, the actual goal of sacrifice is Lord Viñëu. Therefore in Bhagavad-gétä (9.23) it is said:
ye 'py anya-devatä-bhaktä
yajante çraddhayänvitäù
te 'pi mäm eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-pürvakam
"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunté, is really meant for Me alone, but is offered without true understanding."
Thus the worshipers of various demigods also worship the Supreme Lord, but they do so against the regulative principles. The purpose of the regulative principles is to satisfy Lord Viñëu. In the Viñëu Puräëa (3.8.9) the very same thing is confirmed:
varëäçramäcäravatä
puruñeëa paraù pumän
viñëur ärädhyate panthä
nänyat tat-toña-käraëam
 [Cc. Madhya 8.58]
Here it is clearly mentioned that the karmé, jïäné or yogé—in fact, everyone—worships Lord Viñëu if he is actually expert in knowledge of the Vedas and Tantras. The word kovidäù is very significant, for it indicates the devotees of the Lord. Only the devotees know perfectly that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, is all-pervading. Within the material energy, He is represented by the five material elements as well as the mind, intelligence and ego. He is also represented by another energy—the living entities—and all these manifestations in the spiritual and material world combined are but representations of the different energies of the Lord. The conclusion is that the Lord is one and that He is expanded in everything. This is understood by the Vedic version: sarvaà khalv idaà brahma. One who knows this concentrates all his energy in worshiping Lord Viñëu.

tvam eka ädyaù puruñaù supta-çaktis

tvam—Your Lordship; ekaù—one; ädyaù—the original; puruñaù—person; supta—dormant; çaktiù—energy; tayä—by which; rajaù—the passion energy; sattva—goodness; tamaù—ignorance; vibhidyate—is diversified; mahän—the total material energy; aham—egotism; kham—the sky; marut—the air; agni—fire; väù—water; dharäù—earth; sura-åñayaù—the demigods and the great sages; bhüta-gaëäù—the living entities; idam—all this; yataù—from whom.

My dear Lord, You are the only Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. Before the creation of this material world, Your material energy remains in a dormant condition. When Your material energy is agitated, the three qualities—namely goodness, passion and ignorance—act, and as a result the total material energy—egotism, ether, air, fire, water, earth and all the various demigods and saintly persons—becomes manifest. Thus the material world is created.

PURPORT
If the whole creation is one—that is, nothing but the Supreme Lord, or Viñëu—then why do the expert transcendentalists make such categories as are found in the above verse? Why do learned and expert scholars distinguish between matter and spirit? In answer to these questions, Lord Çiva says that spirit and matter are not creations of various philosophers, but are manifested by Lord Viñëu, as described in this verse: tvam eka ädyaù puruñaù. Spiritual and material categories are made possible by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but actually there are no such distinctions for the living entities who are eternally engaged in the service of the Lord. There is only a material world for those who want to imitate the Lord and become enjoyers. Indeed, the material world is nothing but forgetfulness of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the creator of everything. The distinction between matter and spirit is created by the sleeping energy of the Lord when the Lord wants to give some facility to those living entities who want to imitate the Lord in His enjoyment. It is only for them that this material world is created by the dormant energy of the Lord. For instance, sometimes children want to imitate their mother and cook in the kitchen, and at such a time the mother supplies them with some toys so that the children can imitate her cooking. Similarly, when some of the living entities want to imitate the activities of the Lord, this material cosmic manifestation is created for them by the Lord. The material creation is therefore caused by the Lord through His material energy. It is by the glance of the Lord that the material energy is activated. At that time the three material qualities are set into motion, and the material energy is manifested first in the form of the mahat-tattva, then egotism, then ether, then air, fire, water and earth. After the creation, the living entities are impregnated in the cosmic manifestation, and they emerge as Lord Brahmä and the seven great åñis, then as different demigods. From the demigods come human beings, animals, trees, birds, beasts and everything else. The original cause, however, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as verified herein-tvam eka ädyaù puruñaù. This is also confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä (5.1):
éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù
sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù
anädir ädir govindaù
sarva-käraëa-käraëam
Those who are covered by the material energy cannot understand that the origin of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. This is summarized in the Vedänta aphorism janmädy asya yataù [SB 1.1.1] (Vedänta-sütra 1.1.2). Kåñëa also confirms this in Bhagavad-gétä (10.8):
ahaà sarvasya prabhavo
mattaù sarvaà pravartate
iti matvä bhajante mäà
budhä bhäva-samanvitäù
"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts."
When Kåñëa says that He is the origin of everything (ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8]), He means that He is even the source of Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, the puruña-avatäras, the material manifestation and all the living entities within the material world. Actually the word prabhava ("creation") only refers to this material world, for since the spiritual world is eternally existing, there is no question of creation. In the Catuù-çloké of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Lord says, aham eväsam evägre: "I was existing in the beginning before the creation." (SB 2.9.33) In the Vedas it is also said, eko näräyaëa äsét: "Before the creation there was only Näräyaëa." This is also confirmed by Çaìkaräcärya. Näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät: "Näräyaëa is transcendental to the creation." (Géta-bhäñya) Since all the activities of Näräyaëa are spiritual, when Näräyaëa said, "Let there be creation," that creation was all-spiritual. The "material" only exists for those who have forgotten that Näräyaëa is the original cause.

My dear Lord, after creating by Your own potencies, You enter within the creation in four kinds of forms. Being within the hearts of the living entities, You know them and know how they are enjoying their senses. The so-called happiness of this material creation is exactly like the bees' enjoyment of honey after it has been collected in the honeycomb.

PURPORT
The material cosmic manifestation is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because dull matter cannot work independently, the Lord Himself enters within this material creation in the form of a partial expansion (Paramätmä), and He enters also by His separated parts and parcels (the living entities). In other words, both the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead enter into the material creation just to make it active. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.5):
apareyam itas tv anyäà
prakåtià viddhi me paräm
jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho
yayedaà dhäryate jagat
"Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with the material nature and are sustaining the universe."
Since the material world cannot work independently, the living entities enter into the material manifestation in four different types of bodies. The word catur-vidham is significant in this verse. There are four types of living entities born within this material world. Some are born by way of an embryo (jaräyu-ja), by way of eggs (aëòa-ja), perspiration (sveda-ja) and, like the trees, by way of seeds (udbhij-ja). Regardless of how these living entities appear, they are all busy in the pursuit of sense enjoyment.
The materialistic scientists' contention that living entities other than human beings have no soul is nullified herein. Whether they are born through an embryo, eggs, perspiration or seeds, all living entities in the 8,400,000 species of life are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and each therefore is an individual spiritual spark and soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also remains within the heart of the living entity, regardless of whether the living entity is a man, animal, tree, germ or microbe. The Lord resides in everyone's heart, and because all living entities who come to this material world do so in order to fulfill their desire for sense enjoyment, the Lord directs the living entities to enjoy their senses. Thus the Paramätmä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knows everyone's desires. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15):
sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo
mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."
Remaining within the hearts of all living entities, the Lord bestows remembrance by which the living entities can enjoy certain things. Thus the living entities create their enjoyable honeycombs and then enjoy them. The example of the bees is appropriate because when bees try to enjoy their honeycomb, they have to suffer the bites of other bees. Because bees bite one another when they enjoy honey, they are not exclusively enjoying the sweetness of the honey, for there is also suffering. In other words, the living entities are subjected to the pains and pleasures of material enjoyment, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing their plans for sense enjoyment, is aloof from them. In the Upaniñads the example is given of two birds sitting on a tree. One bird (the jéva, or living entity) is enjoying the fruits of that tree, and the other bird (Paramätmä) is simply witnessing. In the Bhagavad-gétä (13.23) the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Paramätmä is described as upadrañöä (the overseer) and anumantä (the permitter).
Thus the Lord simply witnesses and gives the living entity sanction for sense enjoyment. It is the Paramätmä also who gives the intelligence by which the bees can construct a hive, collect honey from various flowers, store it and enjoy it. Although the Paramätmä is aloof from the living entities, He knows their intentions, and He gives them facilities by which they can enjoy or suffer the results of their actions. Human society is exactly like a beehive, for everyone is engaged in collecting honey from various flowers, or collecting money from various sources, and creating large empires for common enjoyment. However, after these empires are created, the bites of other nations have to be suffered. Sometimes nations declare war upon one another, and the human beehives become sources of misery. Although human beings are creating their beehives in order to enjoy the sweetness of their senses, they are at the same time suffering from the bites of other persons or nations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Paramätmä is simply witnessing all these activities. The conclusion is that both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the jévas enter into this material world. However, the Paramätmä, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshipable because He has arranged for the happiness of the living entity in the material world. Because it is the material world, however, no one can enjoy any kind of happiness without inebriety. Material enjoyment means inebriety, whereas spiritual enjoyment means pure enjoyment under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

saù—that; eñaù—this; lokän—all the planetary systems; ati—very much; caëòa-vegaù—the great force; vikarñasi—destroys; tvam—Your Lordship; khalu—however; käla-yänaù—in due course of time; bhütäni—all living entities; bhütaiù—by other living entities; anumeya-tattvaù—the Absolute Truth can be guessed; ghana-ävaléù—the clouds; väyuù—air; iva—like; aviñahyaù—unbearable.

My dear Lord, Your absolute authority cannot be directly experienced, but one can guess by seeing the activities of the world that everything is being destroyed in due course of time. The force of time is very strong, and everything is being destroyed by something else—just as one animal is being eaten by another animal. Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.

PURPORT
The process of destruction is going on according to the law of nature. Nothing within this material world can be permanent, although scientists, philosophers, workers and everyone else are trying to make things permanent. One foolish scientist recently declared that eventually life will be made permanent through science. Some so-called scientists are also trying to manufacture living entities within the laboratory. Thus in one way or another everyone is busy denying the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and rejecting the supreme authority of the Lord. However, the Lord is so powerful that He destroys everything in the form of death. As Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä (10.34), måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: "I am all-devouring death." The Lord is just like death to the atheists, for He takes away everything they accumulate in the material world. Hiraëyakaçipu, the father of Prahläda, always denied the existence of the Lord, and he tried to kill his five-year-old boy due to the boy's unflinching faith in God. However, in due course of time the Lord appeared as Nåsiàhadeva and killed Hiraëyakaçipu in the presence of his son. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.13.47), this killing process is natural. Jévo jévasya jévanam: "one animal is food for another animal." A frog is eaten by a snake, a snake is eaten by a mongoose, and the mongoose is eaten by another animal. In this way the process of destruction goes on by the supreme will of the Lord. Although we do not see the hand of the Supreme Lord directly, we can feel the presence of that hand through the Lord's process of destruction. We can see the clouds scattered by the wind, although we cannot see how this is being done because it is not possible to see the wind. Similarly, although we do not directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can see that He controls the process of destruction. The destructive process is going on fiercely under the control of the Lord, but the atheists cannot see it.

My dear Lord, all living entities within this material world are mad after planning for things, and they are always busy with a desire to do this or that. This is due to uncontrollable greed. The greed for material enjoyment is always existing in the living entity, but Your Lordship is always alert, and in due course of time You strike him, just as a snake seizes a mouse and very easily swallows him.

PURPORT
Everyone is greedy, and everyone makes plans for material enjoyment. In his lust for material enjoyment, the living entity is described as a madman. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (3.27):
prakåteù kriyamäëäni
guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù
ahaìkära-vimüòhätmä
kartäham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature."
Everything is enacted by the laws of nature, and these laws are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheists, or unintelligent men, do not know this. They are busy making their own plans, and big nations are busy expanding their empires. And yet we know that in due course of time many empires have come into existence and been destroyed. Many aristocratic families were created by people in their extreme madness, but we can see that in the course of time those families and empires have all been destroyed. But still the foolish atheists do not accept the supreme authority of the Lord. Such foolish people unnecessarily concoct their own duties without referring to the supreme authority of the Lord. The so-called political leaders are busy making plans to advance the material prosperity of their nation, but factually these political leaders only want an exalted position for themselves. Due to their greed for material position, they falsely present themselves as leaders before the people and collect their votes, although they are completely under the grip of the laws of material nature. These are some of the faults of modern civilization. Without taking to God consciousness and accepting the authority of the Lord, the living entities become ultimately confused and frustrated in their planmaking attempts. Due to their unauthorized plans for economic development, the price of commodities is rising daily all over the world, so much so that is has become difficult for the poorer classes, and they are suffering the consequences. And due to lack of Kåñëa consciousness, people are being fooled by so-called leaders and planmakers. Consequently, the sufferings of the people are increasing. According to the laws of nature, which are backed by the Lord, nothing can be permanent within this material world; therefore everyone should be allowed to take shelter of the Absolute in order to be saved. In this regard, Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä (5.29):
bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà
sarva-loka-maheçvaram
suhådaà sarva-bhütänäà
jïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati
"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries."
If one wants peace of mind and tranquillity in society, he must accept the fact that the real enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is the proprietor of everything all over the universe, and He is the supreme friend of all living entities as well. By understanding this, people can become happy and peaceful individually and collectively.

kaù—who; tvat—Your; pada-abjam—lotus feet; vijahäti—avoids; paëòitaù—learned; yaù—who; te—unto You; avamäna—deriding; vyayamäna—decreasing; ketanaù—this body; viçaìkayä—without any doubt; asmat—our; guruù—spiritual master, father; arcati—worships; sma—in the past; yat—that; vinä—without; upapattim—agitation; manavaù—the Manus; catuù-daça—fourteen.

My dear Lord, any learned person knows that unless he worships You, his entire life is spoiled. Knowing this, how could he give up worshiping Your lotus feet? Even our father and spiritual master, Lord Brahmä, unhesitatingly worshiped You, and the fourteen Manus followed in his footsteps.

PURPORT
The word paëòita means "a wise man." Who is actually a wise man? The wise man is described in Bhagavad-gétä (7.19) in this way:
bahünäà janmanäm ante
jïänavän mäà prapadyate
väsudevaù sarvam iti
sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù
"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare."
Thus when the wise man actually becomes wise after many births and whimsical attempts at self-realization, he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Such a mahätmä, or learned person, knows that Kåñëa, Väsudeva, is everything (väsudevaù sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19]). Learned persons always think that life is wasted unless they worship Lord Kåñëa or become His devotee. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé also says that when one becomes an advanced devotee, he understands that he should be reserved and perseverant (kñäntiù) and that he should engage in the service of the Lord and not waste time (avyartha-kälatvam [Cc. Madhya 23.18-19]). He should also be detached from all material attraction (viraktiù), and he should not long for any material respect in return for his activities (mäna-çünyatä). He should be certain that Kåñëa will bestow His mercy upon him (äçä-bandhaù), and he should always be very eager to serve the Lord faithfully (samutkaëöhä). The wise man is always very eager to glorify the Lord by chanting and hearing (näma-gäne sadä ruciù), and he is always eager to describe the transcendental qualities of the Lord (äsaktis tad-guëäkhyäne). He should also be attracted to those places where the Lord had His pastimes (prétis tad-vasati-sthale). These are symptoms of an advanced devotee.
An advanced devotee, or a perfect human being who is actually wise and learned, cannot give up his service at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although Lord Brahmä has a long life-span (4,320,000,000 years constitute twelve hours in a day of Brahmä), Brahmä is afraid of death and consequently engages in the devotional service of the Lord. Similarly, all the Manus who appear and disappear during the day of Brahmä are also engaged in the Lord's devotional service. In Brahmä's one day, fourteen Manus appear and disappear. The first Manu is Sväyambhuva Manu. Each Manu lives for seventy-one yugas, each consisting of some 4,320,000 years. Although the Manus have such a long life-span, they still prepare for the next life by engaging in the devotional service of the Lord. In this age human beings only live for sixty or eighty years, and even this small life-span is gradually decreasing. Therefore it is even more imperative for human beings to take to the worship of the lotus feet of the Lord by constantly chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, as recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu.
tåëäd api sunécena
taror api sahiñëunä
amäninä mänadena
kértanéyaù sadä hariù
 [Cc. Ädi 17.31]
When one is engaged in devotional service, he is often surrounded by envious people, and often many enemies come to try to defeat him or stop him. This is not new in this present age, for even in the days of yore Prahläda Mahäräja, who was engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, was harassed by his demoniac father, Hiraëyakaçipu. The atheists are always prepared to harass a devotee; therefore Caitanya Mahäprabhu suggested that one be very tolerant of these people. Nonetheless, one has to continue chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra and preaching the chanting of this mantra because such preaching and chanting constitute the perfection of life. One should chant Hare Kåñëa and preach about the urgency of making this life perfect in all respects. One should thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord and follow in the footsteps of previous äcäryas, beginning with Lord Brahmä and others.
TEXT 68
atha tvam asi no brahman
paramätman vipaçcitäm
viçvaà rudra-bhaya-dhvastam
akutaçcid-bhayä gatiù


atha—therefore; tvam—You, my Lord; asi—are; naù—our; brahman—O Supreme Brahman; parama-ätman—O Supersoul; vipaçcitäm—for the learned wise men; viçvam—the whole universe; rudra-bhaya—being afraid of Rudra; dhvastam—annihilated; akutaçcit-bhayä—undoubtedly fearless; gatiù—destination.

My dear Lord, all actually learned persons know You as the Supreme Brahman and the Supersoul. Although the entire universe is afraid of Lord Rudra, who ultimately annihilates everything, for the learned devotees You are the fearless destination of all.

PURPORT
For the purpose of creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation, there are three lords—Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva (Maheçvara). The material body is finished at the time of annihilation. Both the universal body and the small unit, the individual living entity's body, are susceptible to annihilation at the ultimate end. However, the devotees do not fear the annihilation of the body, for they are confident that after the annihilation they will go back home, back to Godhead (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna [Bg. 4.9]).
If one strictly follows the process of devotional service, he has no fear of death, for he is predestined to go back home, back to Godhead. The nondevotees are fearful of death because they have no guarantee of where they are going or of the type of body they are going to get in their next life. The word rudra-bhaya is significant in this verse because Rudra himself, Lord Çiva, is speaking of "fear of Rudra." This indicates that there are many Rudras—eleven Rudras—and the Rudra (Lord Çiva) who was offering this prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is different from the other Rudras, although he is as powerful as they are. The conclusion is that one Rudra is afraid of another Rudra because each and every one of them is engaged in the destruction of this cosmic manifestation. Except for the devotee, everyone is afraid of Rudra, even Rudra himself. A devotee is never afraid of Rudra because he is always secure, being protected by the lotus feet of the Lord. As Çré Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.31), kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati: "My dear Arjuna, you may declare publicly that My pure devotee will not be vanquished under any circumstances."
TEXT 69
idaà japata bhadraà vo

idam—this; japata—while chanting; bhadram—all auspiciousness; vaù—all of you; viçuddhäù—purified; nåpa-nandanäù—the sons of the king; sva-dharmam—one's occupational duties; anutiñöhantaù—executing; bhagavati—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; arpita—given up; äçayäù—possessing all kinds of faithfulness.

My dear sons of the king, just execute your occupational duty as kings with a pure heart. Just chant this prayer fixing your mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. That will bring you all good fortune, for the Lord will be very much pleased with you.

PURPORT
The prayers offered by Lord Çiva are very authoritative and significant. Simply by offering prayers to the Supreme Lord one can become perfect, even though engaged in his occupational duty. The real purpose of life is to become a devotee of the Lord. It does not matter where one is situated. Whether one is a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, American, Englishman, Indian, etc., one can execute devotional service anywhere and everywhere in the material existence simply by offering prayers unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra is also a prayer, for a prayer addresses the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His name and invokes good fortune by petitioning the Lord to allow one to engage in His devotional service. The Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra also says, "My dear Lord Kåñëa, my dear Lord Räma, O energy of the Lord, Hare, kindly engage me in Your service." Although one may be situated in a lowly position, he can execute devotional service under any circumstance, as stated, ahaituky apratihatä: "Devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition." (SB 1.2.6) Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu also recommended this process:
jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta eva
jévanti san-mukharitäà bhavadéya-värtäm
sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhir
ye präyaço 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyäm
(SB 10.14.3)
One may remain situated in his own place or his own occupational duty and still lend his ear to receive the message of the Lord from realized souls. The Kåñëa conscious movement is based on this principle, and we are opening centers all over the world to give everyone a chance to hear the message of Lord Kåñëa in order to go back home, back to Godhead.
TEXT 70
tam evätmänam ätma-sthaà
sarva-bhüteñv avasthitam
püjayadhvaà gåëantaç ca
dhyäyantaç cäsakåd dharim


tam—unto Him; eva—certainly; ätmänam—the Supreme Soul; ätma-stham—within your hearts; sarva—all; bhüteñu—in every living being; avasthitam—situated; püjayadhvam—just worship Him; gåëantaù ca—always chanting; dhyäyantaù ca—always meditating upon; asakåt—continuously; harim—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Therefore, O sons of the king, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is situated in everyone's heart. He is also within your hearts. Therefore chant the glories of the Lord and always meditate upon Him continuously.

PURPORT
The word asakåt is significant, for it means not just for a few minutes but continuously. That is the instruction given by Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu in His Çikñäñöaka 3. Kértanéyaù sadä hariù: [Cc. Ädi 17.31] "The holy name of the Lord should be chanted twenty-four hours daily." Therefore in this Kåñëa consciousness movement we request the devotees to chant at least sixteen rounds on their beads daily. Actually one has to chant twenty-four hours daily, just like Öhäkura Haridäsa, who was chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra three hundred thousand times daily. Indeed, he had no other business. Some of the Gosvämés, like Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé, were also chanting very rigidly and also offering obeisances very rigidly. As stated in Çréniväsäcärya's prayer to the Six Gosvämés (Ñaò-gosvämy-añöaka): saìkhyä-pürvaka-näma-gäna-natibhiù kälävasäné-kåtau. The word saìkhyä-pürvaka means "maintaining a numerical strength." Not only was Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé chanting the holy name of the Lord, but he was also offering obeisances in the same prolific numbers.
Because the princes were ready to enter into some severe austerity in order to worship the Lord, Lord Çiva advised them to constantly chant of and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is significant that Lord Çiva personally offered his prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead just as he was taught by his father, Lord Brahmä. Similarly, he was also preaching to the princes according to the paramparä system. One not only should practice the instructions received from the spiritual master but should also distribute this knowledge to one's disciples.
The words ätmänam ätma-sthaà sarva-bhüteñv avasthitam are also significant. The Personality of Godhead is the origin of all living entities. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, He is the father of all of them. One can search out the Supreme Lord very easily within one's heart, for He is situated in every living entity's heart. In this verse the process of worshiping the Lord is considered to be very easy and complete, for anyone can sit down anywhere and in any condition of life and simply chant the holy names of the Lord. By chanting and hearing, one automatically engages in meditation.
TEXT 71
yogädeçam upäsädya
dhärayanto muni-vratäù
samähita-dhiyaù sarva
etad abhyasatädåtäù


yoga-ädeçam—this instruction of bhakti-yoga; upäsädya—constantly reading; dhärayantaù—and taking within the heart; muni-vratäù—just take the vow of the great sages, the vow of silence; samähita—always fixed in the mind; dhiyaù—with intelligence; sarve—all of you; etat—this; abhyasata—practice; ädåtäù—with great reverence.

My dear princes, in the form of a prayer I have delineated the yoga system of chanting the holy name. All of you should take this important stotra within your minds and promise to keep it in order to become great sages. By acting silently like a great sage and by giving attention and reverence, you should practice this method.

PURPORT
In the haöha-yoga system one has to practice bodily exercises, dhyäna, dhäraëä, äsana, meditation, etc. One also has to sit in one place in a particular posture and concentrate his gaze on the tip of the nose. There are so many rules and regulations for the haöha-yoga system that it is practically impossible to perform it in this age. The alternative system of bhakti-yoga is very easy not only in this age but in others as well, for this yoga system was advocated long ago by Lord Çiva when he advised the princes, the sons of Mahäräja Präcénabarhiñat. The bhakti-yoga system is not newly introduced, for even five thousand years ago Lord Kåñëa recommended this bhakti-yoga as the topmost yoga. As Kåñëa tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä (6.47):
yoginäm api sarveñäà
mad-gatenäntarätmanä
çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà
sa me yuktatamo mataù
"Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."
The topmost yogé is he who constantly thinks of Kåñëa within himself and chants the glories of the Lord. In other words, this system of bhakti-yoga has been existing from time immemorial and is now continuing in this Kåñëa consciousness movement.
The word muni-vratäù is significant in this regard because those who are interested in advancing in spiritual life must be silent. Silence means talking only of kåñëa-kathä. This is the silence of Mahäräja Ambaréña:
sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayor
vacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänuvarëane
"King Ambaréña always fixed his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord and talked of Him only." (SB 9.4.18) We should also take this opportunity in life to become as good as a great saint simply by not talking unnecessarily with unwanted persons. We should either talk of Kåñëa or chant Hare Kåñëa undeviatingly. This is called muni-vrata. The intelligence must be very sharp (samähita-dhiyaù) and should always be acting in Kåñëa consciousness. The words etad abhyasatädåtäù indicate that if one takes these instructions from a spiritual master with great reverence (ädåta) and practices them accordingly, he will find this bhakti-yoga process to be very, very easy.
TEXT 72
idam äha puräsmäkaà
bhagavän viçvasåk-patiù
bhågv-ädénäm ätmajänäà
sisåkñuù saàsisåkñatäm


idam—this; äha—said; purä—formerly; asmäkam—unto us; bhagavän—the lord; viçva-såk—the creators of the universe; patiù—master; bhågu-ädénäm—of the great sages headed by Bhågu; ätmajänäm—of his sons; sisåkñuù—desirous of creating; saàsisåkñatäm—who are in charge of creation.

This prayer was first spoken to us by Lord Brahmä, the master of all creators. The creators, headed by Bhågu, were instructed in these prayers because they wanted to create.

PURPORT
Lord Brahmä was created by Lord Viñëu; then Lord Brahmä created Lord Çiva and other great sages, headed by Bhågu Muni. These great sages included Bhågu, Maréci, Ätreya, Vasiñöha and others. All these great sages were in charge of creating population. Since there were not very many living entities in the beginning, Viñëu entrusted Brahmä with the business of creation, and Brahmä in his turn created many hundreds and thousands of demigods and great sages to continue with the creation. At the same time, Lord Brahmä cautioned all his sons and disciples by reciting the prayers now recited by Lord Çiva. The material creation means material engagement, but material engagements can be counteracted if we always remember our relationship with the Lord as that relationship is described in these prayers recited by Lord Çiva. In this way we can remain constantly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus despite our engagement in the creation, we cannot be deviated from the path of Kåñëa consciousness. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is especially meant for this purpose. In this material world everyone is engaged in some particular occupational duty which is prescribed in the varëäçrama-dharma. Brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras and everyone are engaged in their occupational duty, but if one remembers his first duty—keeping in constant contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead—everything will be successful. If one simply executes the rules and regulations of the varëäçrama-dharma in the role of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra and keeps busy and does not remember one's eternal relationship with the Lord, one's business and activities as well as occupational duties will simply be a waste of time. This is confirmed in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.8):
dharmaù svanuñöhitaù puàsäà
viñvaksena-kathäsu yaù
notpädayed yadi ratià
çrama eva hi kevalam
The conclusion is that even if one is busy executing his occupational duty, his business in Kåñëa consciousness need not be hampered. He has simply to execute the devotional service of çravaëaà kértanam [SB 7.5.23]—hearing, chanting and remembering. One need not abandon his occupational duty. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (18.46):
yataù pravåttir bhütänäà
yena sarvam idaà tatam
sva-karmaëä tam abhyarcya
siddhià vindati mänavaù
"By worship of the Lord—who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading-man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection."
Thus one can continue with his occupational duty, but if he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord Çiva herein prescribes, he attains his perfection of life. Svanuñöhitasya dharmasya saàsiddhir hari-toñaëam (SB 1.2.13). We should continue executing our occupational duties, but if we try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by our duties, then our lives will be perfected.
TEXT 73
te vayaà noditäù sarve

te—by him; vayam—all of us; noditäù—ordered; sarve—all; prajä-sarge—at the time of creating population; prajä-éçvaräù—the controllers of all living entities; anena—by this; dhvasta-tamasaù—being freed from all kinds of ignorance; sisåkñmaù—we created; vividhäù—various kinds of; prajäù—living entities.

When all the Prajäpatis were ordered to create by Lord Brahmä, we chanted these prayers in praise of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and became completely free from all ignorance. Thus we were able to create different types of living entities.

PURPORT
In this verse we can understand that the various types of living entities were created simultaneously at the very beginning of the creation. The nonsensical Darwinian theory of evolution is not applicable here. It is not that intelligent human beings did not exist millions of years ago. On the contrary, it is understood that the most intelligent creature, Lord Brahmä, was first created. Then Lord Brahmä created other saintly sages like Maréci, Bhågu, Ätreya, Vasiñöha and Lord Çiva. They in their turn created different types of bodies according to karma. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam Lord Kapiladeva told His mother that the living entity gets a particular type of body in accordance with his work and that this body is decided upon by higher authorities. The higher authorities, as appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are Lord Brahmä and all other Prajäpatis and Manus. Thus from the beginning of creation it can be seen that the first creature is the most intelligent. It is not that so-called modern intelligence has developed by the gradual process of evolution. As stated in Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa, there is a gradual evolutionary process, but it is not the body that is evolving. All the bodily forms are already there. It is the spiritual entity, or spiritual spark within the body, that is being promoted by the laws of nature under the supervision of superior authority. We can understand from this verse that from the very beginning of creation different varieties of living entities were existing. It is not that some of them have become extinct. Everything is there; it is due to our lack of knowledge that we cannot see things in their proper perspective.
In this verse the word dhvasta-tamasaù is very important, for without being free of ignorance one cannot control the creation of different types of living entities. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.31.1), daiva-netreëa—bodies are awarded under the supervision of superior powers. How can these superior powers control the evolutionary process of the living entity if they are not free from all imperfection? The followers of the Vedic instructions cannot accept the Darwinian theory of evolution, for it is marred by imperfect knowledge.
TEXT 74

A devotee of Lord Kåñëa whose mind is always absorbed in Him, who with great attention and reverence chants this stotra [prayer], will achieve the greatest perfection of life without delay.

PURPORT
Perfection means becoming a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. As stated in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.28): väsudeva-parä vedä väsudeva-parä makhäù. The ultimate goal of life is Väsudeva, or Kåñëa. Any devotee of Lord Kåñëa can attain all perfection, material gains and liberation simply by offering prayers to Him. There are many varieties of prayers to Lord Kåñëa chanted by great sages and great personalities such as Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva. Lord Kåñëa is known as çiva-viriïcinutam (SB 11.5.33). Çiva means Lord Çiva, and viriïci means Lord Brahmä. Both of these demigods are engaged in offering prayers to Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa. If we follow in the footsteps of such great personalities and become devotees of Lord Kåñëa, our lives will become successful. Unfortunately people do not know this secret. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum: "They do not know that the real interest and the highest perfection of life is to worship Lord Viñëu [Kåñëa]." (SB 7.5.31) It is impossible to become satisfied by trying to adjust the external energy. Without being a devotee of Lord Kåñëa, one can only be baffled and confused. To save living entities from such a calamity, Lord Kåñëa points out in Bhagavad-gétä (7.19):
bahünäà janmanäm ante
jïänavän mäà prapadyate
väsudevaù sarvam iti
sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù
"After many, many births and deaths, a wise man surrenders unto Me, knowing very well that I, Väsudeva, am everything. Such a great soul is very rare."
We can achieve whatever benediction we want simply by becoming devotees of Väsudeva.
TEXT 75
çreyasäm iha sarveñäà

çreyasäm—of all benedictions; iha—in this world; sarveñäm—of every person; jïänam—knowledge; niùçreyasam—the supreme benefit; param—transcendental; sukham—happiness; tarati—crosses over; duñpäram—insurmountable; jïäna—knowledge; nauù—boat; vyasana—danger; arëavam—the ocean.

In this material world there are different types of achievement, but of all of them the achievement of knowledge is considered to be the highest because one can cross the ocean of nescience only on the boat of knowledge. Otherwise the ocean is impassable.

PURPORT
Actually everyone is suffering within this material world due to ignorance. Every day we see that a person without knowledge commits some criminal act and is later arrested and punished, despite the fact that he actually may not have been conscious of his sinful activity. Such ignorance prevails throughout the world. People do not consider how they are risking their lives in an attempt to have illicit sex life, kill animals to satisfy their tongue, enjoy intoxication and gamble. It is very regrettable that the leaders of the world do not know of the effects of these sinful activities. They are instead taking things very easily and are succeeding in making the ocean of nescience wider and wider.
Opposed to such ignorance, full knowledge is the greatest achievement within this material world. We can practically see that one who has sufficient knowledge is saved from many dangerous pitfalls in life. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.19), bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate: "When one actually becomes wise, he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù: "Such a great soul is very rarely to be found."
This Kåñëa consciousness movement is determined to open wide the eyes of the so-called leaders, who are full of ignorance, and thus save them from the many pitfalls and dangerous conditions of life. The greatest danger is the danger of getting a body lower than that of a human being. It was with great difficulty that we attained this human form of life just to take advantage of this body and reestablish our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda. Lord Çiva advises, however, that those who take advantage of his prayers will very soon become devotees of Lord Väsudeva and thus will be able to cross the ocean of nescience and make life perfect.
TEXT 76
ya imaà çraddhayä yukto

yaù—anyone; imam—this; çraddhayä—with great faith; yuktaù—devoutly attached; mat-gétam—the song composed by me or sung by me; bhagavat-stavam—a prayer offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhéyänaù—by regular study; durärädhyam—very difficult to worship; harim—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ärädhayati—he can, however, worship Him; asau—such a person.

Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping Him are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by me, he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
It is especially significant that Lord Çiva is a pure devotee of Lord Väsudeva. Vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: "Amongst all Vaiñëavas, Lord Çiva is the topmost." Consequently Lord Çiva has a sampradäya, a Vaiñëava disciplic succession, called the Rudra-sampradäya. At the present moment those who belong to the Viñëu-Svämé-sampradäya of Vaiñëavas come from Rudra, Lord Çiva. To become a devotee of Lord Kåñëa, Väsudeva, is very, very difficult. The word especially used in this connection is durärädhyam. The worship of the demigods is not very difficult, but becoming a devotee of Lord Väsudeva, Kåñëa, is not so easy. However, if one adheres to the principles and follows in the footsteps of the higher authorities, as advised by Lord Çiva, one can easily become a devotee of Lord Väsudeva. This is also confirmed by Prahläda Mahäräja. Devotional service cannot be practiced by a mental speculator. Devotional service is a special attainment which can be acquired only by a person who has surrendered unto a pure devotee. As confirmed by Prahläda Mahäräja, mahéyasäà päda-rajo-'bhiñekaà niñkiïcanänäà na våëéta yävat: "Unless one accepts the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee, who is free from all material contamination, one cannot enter into the devotional service of the Lord." (SB 7.5.32)

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. A human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he wants from the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (6.22), yaà labdhvä cäparaà läbhaà manyate nädhikaà tataù: if one can attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has nothing to aspire for, nor does he desire any other gain. When Dhruva Mahäräja became perfect by austerity and saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, he was offered any kind of benediction he wanted. However, Dhruva replied that he did not want anything, for he was perfectly satisfied with the benediction of seeing the Lord. Except for the service of the Supreme Lord, whatever we want is called illusion, mäyä. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said: jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa' (Cc. Madhya 20.108). Every living entity is an eternal servant of the Lord; therefore when one engages in the service of the Lord, he realizes the highest perfection of life. A faithful servant can fulfill any desire by the grace of the master, and one who engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord has nothing to aspire for separately. All his desires are fulfilled simply by engaging constantly in the Lord's loving service. Lord Çiva shows us that any devotee can be successful simply by chanting the prayers which he has recited.
TEXT 78
idaà yaù kalya utthäya
präïjaliù çraddhayänvitaù
çåëuyäc chrävayen martyo
mucyate karma-bandhanaiù


idam—this prayer; yaù—a devotee who; kalye—early in the morning; utthäya—after getting up from bed; präïjaliù—with folded hands; çraddhayä—with faith and devotion; anvitaù—thus being absorbed; çåëuyät—personally chants and hears; çrävayet—and gets others to hear; martyaù—such a human being; mucyate—becomes freed; karma-bandhanaiù—from all kinds of actions resulting from fruitive activities.

A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by Lord Çiva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to fruitive activities.

PURPORT
Mukti, or liberation, means becoming free from the results of fruitive activities. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitvänyathä-rüpam. Mukti means giving up all other activities and being situated in one's constitutional position (svarupeëa vyavasthitiù). In this conditional state, we are entangled by one fruitive activity after another. Karma-bandhana means "the bonds of fruitive activity." As long as one's mind is absorbed in fruitive activities, he has to manufacture plans for happiness. The bhakti-yoga process is different, for bhakti-yoga means acting according to the order of the supreme authority. When we act under the direction of supreme authority, we do not become entangled by fruitive results. For instance, Arjuna fought because the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted him to; therefore he was not responsible for the outcome of the fighting. As far as devotional service is concerned, even hearing and chanting is as good as acting with our body, mind and senses. Actually, hearing and chanting are also activities of the senses. When the senses are utilized for one's own sense gratification, they entangle one in karma, but when they are used for the satisfaction of the Lord, they establish one in bhakti.
TEXT 79
gétaà mayedaà naradeva-nandanäù

gétam—sung; mayä—by me; idam—this; naradeva-nandanäù—O sons of the king; parasya—of the Supreme; puàsaù—Personality of Godhead; parama-ätmanaù—the Supersoul of everyone; stavam—prayer; japantaù—chanting; eka-agra—perfect attention; dhiyaù—intelligence; tapaù—austerities; mahat—great; caradhvam—you practice; ante—at the end; tataù—thereafter; äpsyatha—will achieve; épsitam—the desired result.

My dear sons of the king, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as effective as great austerities. In this way, when you are mature, your life will be successful, and you will certainly achieve all your desired objectives without fail.

PURPORT
If we persistently engage in devotional service, certainly all our desires will be fulfilled in due course of time.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Chanting the Song Sung by Lord Çiva."

Song-9 Prayers by Pracethas( SB 4.30.22-42)
TEXT 22
pracetasa ücuù
namo namaù kleça-vinäçanäya
nirüpitodära-guëähvayäya
mano-vaco-vega-puro-javäya
sarväkña-märgair agatädhvane namaù


pracetasaù ücuù—the Pracetäs said; namaù—obeisances; namaù—obeisances; kleça—material distress; vinäçanäya—unto one who destroys; nirüpita—settled; udära—magnanimous; guëa—qualities; ähvayäya—whose name; manaù—of the mind; vacaù—of speech; vega—the speed; puraù—before; javäya—whose speed; sarva-akña—of all material senses; märgaiù—by the paths; agata—not perceivable; adhvane—whose course; namaù—we offer our respects.

The Pracetäs spoke as follows: Dear Lord, You relieve all kinds of material distress. Your magnanimous transcendental qualities and holy name are all-auspicious. This conclusion is already settled. You can go faster than the speed of mind and words. You cannot be perceived by material senses. We therefore offer You respectful obeisances again and again.

PURPORT
The word nirüpita, meaning "concluded," is very significant in this verse. No one has to conduct research work to find God or make progress in spiritual knowledge. Everything is conclusively there in the Vedas. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the process of the Vedas is perfect and conclusive. The Vedas state, ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù: [Cc. Madhya 17.136] the transcendental names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of the Lord cannot be understood by our blunt material senses. Sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù: when a devotee engages his senses favorably in devotional service, the Lord, through His causeless mercy, reveals Himself to the devotee. This is the conclusive Vedic process. The Vedas also indicate that simply by chanting the holy names of the Lord one can without a doubt become spiritually advanced. We cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the speed of mind or words, but if we stick to devotional service we can easily and quickly approach Him. In other words, the Supreme Lord is attracted by devotional service, and He can approach us more swiftly than we can approach Him with our mental speculation. The Lord has stated that He is beyond the range of mental speculation and the speed of thought, yet He can be approached easily by His causeless mercy. Thus only by His causeless mercy can He be attained. Other methods will not be effective.
TEXT 23
çuddhäya çäntäya namaù sva-niñöhayä
manasy apärthaà vilasad-dvayäya
namo jagat-sthäna-layodayeñu
gåhéta-mäyä-guëa-vigrahäya


çuddhäya—unto the unadulterated; çäntäya—unto the most peaceful; namaù—we offer our obeisances; sva-niñöhayä—by being situated in one's position; manasi—in the mind; apärtham—without any meaning; vilasat—appearing; dvayäya—in whom the dual world; namaù—obeisances; jagat—of the cosmic manifestation; sthäna—maintenance; laya—annihilation; udayeñu—and for creation; gåhéta—accepted; mäyä—material; guëa—of the modes of nature; vigrahäya—the forms.

Dear Lord, we beg to offer our obeisances unto You. When the mind is fixed upon You, the world of duality, although a place for material enjoyment, appears meaningless. Your transcendental form is full of transcendental bliss. We therefore offer our respects unto You. Your appearances as Lord Brahmä, Lord Viñëu and Lord Çiva are meant for the purpose of creating, maintaining and annihilating this cosmic manifestation.

PURPORT
A pure devotee, whose mind is always engaged in the service of the Lord, can certainly appreciate the impermanence of this material world. Although such a devotee may be engaged in executing material activities, this stage is called anäsakti. As explained by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, anäsaktasya viñayän yathärham upayuïjataù. A devotee is always unattached to material activities because in the liberated stage his mind is always fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord.
This material world is called dvaita, the world of duality. A devotee knows very well that everything within this material world is but a manifestation of the Supreme Lord's energy. To maintain the three modes of material nature, the Supreme Lord takes on different forms as Lord Brahmä, Lord Viñëu and Lord Çiva. Unaffected by the modes of material nature, the Lord takes on different forms to create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation. The conclusion is that although the pure devotee appears to engage in material activities in the service of the Lord, he knows very well that material enjoyment for sense gratification has no use whatsoever.
TEXT 24
namo viçuddha-sattväya
haraye hari-medhase
väsudeväya kåñëäya
prabhave sarva-sätvatäm


namaù—obeisances; viçuddha-sattväya—unto You, whose existence is free from all material influence; haraye—who takes away all miserable conditions of devotees; hari-medhase—whose brain works only for the deliverance of the conditioned soul; väsudeväya—the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead; kåñëäya—unto Kåñëa; prabhave—who increases the influence; sarva-sätvatäm—of all kinds of devotees.

Dear Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You because Your existence is completely independent of all material influences. Your Lordship always takes away the devotee's miserable conditions, for Your brain plans how to do so. You live everywhere as Paramätmä; therefore You are known as Väsudeva. You also accept Vasudeva as Your father, and You are celebrated by the name Kåñëa. You are so kind that You always increase the influence of all kinds of devotees.

PURPORT
In the previous verse it has been said (gåhéta-mäyä-guëa-vigrahäya) that the Lord accepts three kinds of bodies (Viñëu, Brahmä and Çiva) for the purposes of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmic manifestation. The three predominating deities of the material universe (Brahmä, Viñëu and Çiva) are called guëa-avatäras. There are many kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the first incarnations within this material world are Brahmä, Viñëu and Maheçvara (Çiva). Out of these three, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva accept material bodies, but Lord Viñëu does not accept a material body. Lord Viñëu is therefore known as viçuddha-sattva. His existence is completely free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Viñëu is in the same category with Lord Brahmä and Çiva. The çästras forbid us to think in this way.
yas tu näräyaëaà devaà
brahma-rudrädi-daivataiù
samatvenaiva vékñeta
sa päñaëòé bhaved dhruvam
 [Cc. Madhya 18.116]
One who considers Lord Viñëu to be in the same category with devas like Lord Brahmä or Lord Çiva or who thinks Lord Brahmä and Çiva to be equal to Lord Viñëu is to be considered as päñaëòé (a faithless nonbeliever). Therefore in this verse Lord Viñëu is distinguished in the words namo viçuddha-sattväya. Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahmä is exalted due to his pious activities; therefore he is given the high post of Brahmä. Lord Çiva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahmä, the living entity. Lord Çiva is therefore explained in Brahma-saàhitä (5.45) in this way:
kñéraà yathä dadhi vikära-viçeña-yogät
saïjäyate na hi tataù påthag asti hetoù
yaù çambhutäm api tathä samupaiti käryäd
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
Lord Çiva is considered to be like yogurt (dadhi). Yogurt is nothing but transformed milk; nonetheless, yogurt cannot be accepted as milk. Similarly, Lord Çiva holds almost all the powers of Lord Viñëu, and he is also above the qualities of the living entity, but he is not exactly like Viñëu, just as yogurt, although transformed milk, is not exactly like milk.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also described herein as väsudeväya kåñëäya. Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all Viñëu expansions are His plenary portions or portions of His plenary portions (known as sväàça and kalä). The sväàça, or direct expansion, is also called aàça. All viñëu-tattvas are sväàça, direct parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa is known as Väsudeva because He appeared in this material world as the son of Vasudeva. Similarly, He is known as Devaké-nandana, Yaçodä-nandana, Nanda-nandana and so on.
Again and again the Lord is very much interested in increasing the influence of His devotees. Therefore He is described herein as prabhave sarva-sätvatäm. The sätvata community is a community of Vaiñëavas, pure devotees of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has unlimited powers, and He wants to see that His devotees are also entrusted with unlimited powers. A devotee of the Lord is always, therefore, distinguished from all other living entities.
The word hari means "one who takes away all miserable conditions," and hari-medhase means that the Lord is always planning ways to deliver the conditioned soul from the clutches of mäyä. The Lord is so kind that He personally incarnates to deliver the conditioned souls, and whenever He comes, He makes His plans.
pariträëäya sädhünäà
vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm
dharma-saàsthäpanärthäya
sambhavämi yuge yuge
"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium." (Bg. 4.8)
Since the Lord delivers all conditioned souls from the clutches of mäyä, He is known as hari-medhas. In the list of incarnations, Kåñëa is described as the supreme and original Personality of Godhead.
ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù
kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam
indräri-vyäkulaà lokaà
måòayanti yuge yuge
(SB 1.3.28)
Kåñëa, the original Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world when the demigods, who are devotees of the Lord, are disturbed by the demons.
TEXT 25
namaù kamala-näbhäya
namaù kamala-mäline
namaù kamala-pädäya
namas te kamalekñaëa


namaù—we offer our respectful obeisances; kamala-näbhäya—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whose abdomen the original lotus flower originated; namaù—obeisances; kamala-mäline—who is always decorated with a garland of lotus flowers; namaù—obeisances; kamala-pädäya—whose feet are as beautiful and fragrant as the lotus flower; namaù te—obeisances unto You; kamala-ékñaëa—whose eyes are exactly like the petals of the lotus flower.

Dear Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You because from Your abdomen sprouts the lotus flower, the origin of all living entities. You are always decorated with a lotus garland, and Your feet resemble the lotus flower with all its fragrance. Your eyes are also like the petals of a lotus flower. Therefore we always offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

PURPORT
The word kamala-näbhäya indicates that Lord Viñëu is the origin of the material creation. From the abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, a lotus flower sprouts. Lord Brahmä, the first creature of the universe, is born from this lotus flower, and subsequently, Lord Brahmä creates the whole universe. The origin of all creation is therefore Lord Viñëu, and the origin of all the viñëu-tattvas is Lord Kåñëa. Consequently, Kåñëa is the origin of everything. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (10.8):
ahaà sarvasya prabhavo
mattaù sarvaà pravartate
iti matvä bhajante mäà
budhä bhäva-samanvitäù
"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts." Lord Kåñëa says: "I am the origin of everything." Therefore whatever we see emanates from Him. This is also confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra. Janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] "The Absolute Truth is He from whom everything emanates."
TEXT 26
namaù kamala-kiïjalka-
piçaìgämala-väsase
sarva-bhüta-niväsäya
namo 'yuìkñmahi säkñiëe


namaù—obeisances; kamala-kiïjalka—like the saffron in a lotus flower; piçaìga—yellowish; amala—spotless; väsase—unto Him whose garment; sarva-bhüta—of all living entities; niväsäya—the shelter; namaù—obeisances; ayuìkñmahi—let us offer; säkñiëe—unto the supreme witness.

Dear Lord, the garment You have put on is yellowish in color, like the saffron of a lotus flower, but it is not made of anything material. Since You live in everyone's heart, You are the direct witness of all the activities of all living entities. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You again and again.

PURPORT
In this verse the dress of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His all-pervasive nature are described. The Lord puts on a dress that is yellow, but such a garment is never to be considered material. The garments of the Lord are also the Lord. They are nondifferent from the Lord because they are spiritual in nature.
The word sarva-bhüta-niväsäya further clarifies how Lord Viñëu lives in everyone's heart and acts as the direct witness of all the activities of the conditioned soul. Within this material world the conditioned soul has desires and acts in accordance with these desires. All these acts are observed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15):
sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo
mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." The Lord is present in everyone's heart, and He gives the living entity intelligence. According to the desires of the living entity, the Lord makes him remember or forget. If the living entity is demoniac and wants to forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence to be able to forget the Supreme Lord forever. Similarly, when a devotee wants to serve the Supreme Lord, the Lord, as Paramätmä, gives the devotee the intelligence to make progress in devotional service. The Lord directly witnesses our activities and experiences our desires. The Supreme Lord gives us the facilities to act in the way we wish.
TEXT 27
rüpaà bhagavatä tv etad
açeña-kleça-saìkñayam
äviñkåtaà naù kliñöänäà
kim anyad anukampitam


rüpam—form; bhagavatä—by Your Lordship; tu—but; etat—this; açeña—unlimited; kleça—miseries; saìkñayam—which dissipates; äviñkåtam—revealed; naù—of us; kliñöänäm—who are suffering from material conditions; kim anyat—what to speak of; anukampitam—those to whom You are always favorably disposed.

Dear Lord, we conditioned souls are always covered by ignorance in the bodily conception of life. We therefore always prefer the miserable conditions of material existence. To deliver us from these miserable conditions, You have advented Yourself in this transcendental form. This is evidence of Your unlimited causeless mercy upon those of us who are suffering in this way. What, then, to speak of the devotees to whom You are always so favorably disposed?

PURPORT
When the Lord appears in His original form, He acts to deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants (Bg. 4.8). Although He annihilates the demons, He nonetheless benefits them. It is said that all the living entities who died on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra attained their original constitutional position (svarüpa) because they had the chance to see Kåñëa face to face riding in the chariot of Arjuna. On the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, superficially two things were going on—the demons were being killed, and the devotee, Arjuna, was being protected. However, the results were the same for everyone. Thus it is said that the appearance of the Lord diminishes all kinds of miserable conditions caused by material existence.
It is clearly stated in this verse that this form (açeña-kleça-saìkñayam) is meant to diminish all the miserable conditions experienced in life not only by the devotees but by all others. Äviñkåtaà naù kliñöänäm. The Pracetäs identified themselves as common men. Kim anyad anukampitam. The devotees are always favorably accepted by the Lord. The Lord shows all mercy not only to conditioned souls but also to the devotees, who are already liberated due to their devotional service.
The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcävatära, the worshipable form, the Deity incarnation. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arcä. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Kåñëa consciousness. Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction given by the Lord to beginners. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arcä-vigraha (arcävatära) at home or in the temple.
TEXT 28
etävat tvaà hi vibhubhir
bhävyaà déneñu vatsalaiù
yad anusmaryate käle
sva-buddhyäbhadra-randhana


etävat—thus; tvam—Your Lordship; hi—certainly; vibhubhiù—by expansions; bhävyam—to be conceived; déneñu—unto the humble devotees; vatsalaiù—compassionate; yat—which; anusmaryate—is always remembered; käle—in due course of time; sva-buddhyä—by one's devotional service; abhadra-randhana—O killer of all inauspiciousness.

Dear Lord, You are the killer of all inauspicious things. You are compassionate upon Your poor devotees through the expansion of Your arcä-vigraha. You should certainly think of us as Your eternal servants.

PURPORT
The form of the Lord known as arcä-vigraha is an expansion of His unlimited potencies. When the Lord is gradually satisfied with the service of a devotee, in due course of time He accepts the devotee as one of His many unalloyed servants. By nature, the Lord is very compassionate; therefore the service of neophyte devotees is accepted by the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (9.26):
patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà
yo me bhaktyä prayacchati
tad ahaà bhakty-upahåtam
açnämi prayatätmanaù
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." The devotee offers eatables in the form of vegetables, fruits, leaves and water to the arcä-vigraha. The Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, compassionate upon His devotees, accepts these offerings. Atheists may think that the devotees are engaged in idol worship, but the fact is different. Janärdana, the Supreme Lord, accepts bhäva, the attitude of service. The neophyte devotee engaged in the worship of the Lord may not understand the value of such worship, but the Supreme Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, accepts His devotee and in due course of time takes him home.
In this connection there is a story about a brähmaëa who was offering sweet rice to the Lord within his mind. The brähmaëa had no money nor any means of worshiping the Deity, but within his mind he arranged everything nicely. He had gold pots to bring water from the sacred rivers to wash the Deity, and he offered the Deity very sumptuous food, including sweet rice. Once, before he offered the sweet rice, he thought that it was too hot, and he thought, "Oh, let me test it. My, it is very hot." When he put his finger in the sweet rice to test it, his finger was burned and his meditation broken. Although he was offering food to the Lord within his mind, the Lord accepted it nonetheless. Consequently, the Lord in Vaikuëöha immediately sent a chariot to bring the brähmaëa back home, back to Godhead. Thus it is the duty of every sincere devotee to accept the arcä-vigraha at home or in the temple and worship the form of the Lord as advised in authorized scriptures and directed by the spiritual master.
TEXT 29
yenopaçäntir bhütänäà
kñullakänäm apéhatäm
antarhito 'ntar-hådaye
kasmän no veda näçiñaù


yena—by which process; upaçäntiù—satisfaction of all desires; bhütänäm—of the living entities; kñullakänäm—very much fallen; api—although; éhatäm—desiring many things; antarhitaù—hidden; antaù-hådaye—in the core of the heart; kasmät—why; naù—our; veda—He knows; na—not; äçiñaù—desires.

When the Lord, out of His natural compassion, thinks of His devotee, by that process only are all desires of the neophyte devotee fulfilled. The Lord is situated in every living entity's heart, although the living entity may be very insignificant. The Lord knows everything about the living entity, including all his desires. Although we are very insignificant, why should the Lord not know our desires?

PURPORT
A very advanced devotee does not think himself advanced. He is always very humble. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His plenary expansion as the Paramätmä, or Supersoul, sits in everyone's heart and can understand the attitudes and desires of His devotees. The Lord also gives opportunity to the nondevotees to fulfill their desires, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca [Bg. 15.15]).
Whatever a living entity desires, however insignificant he may be, is noted by the Lord, who gives him a chance to fulfill his desires. If the desires of the nondevotees are fulfilled, why not those of the devotee? A pure devotee simply wants to engage in the service of the Lord without material desire, and if he wants this within the core of his heart, where the Lord is situated, and if he is without ulterior motive, why should the Lord not understand? If a sincere devotee renders service to the Lord or to the arcä-vigraha, the form of the Lord, all his activities prove successful because the Lord is present within his heart and understands his sincerity. Thus if a devotee, with all confidence, goes on discharging the prescribed duties of devotional service, he will ultimately attain success.
TEXT 30
asäv eva varo 'smäkam
épsito jagataù pate
prasanno bhagavän yeñäm
apavarga-gurur gatiù


asau—that; eva—certainly; varaù—benediction; asmäkam—our; épsitaù—desired; jagataù—of the universe; pate—O Lord; prasannaù—satisfied; bhagavän—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; yeñäm—with whom; apavarga—of transcendental loving service; guruù—the teacher; gatiù—the ultimate goal of life.

O Lord of the universe, You are the actual teacher of the science of devotional service. We are satisfied that Your Lordship is the ultimate goal of our lives, and we pray that You will be satisfied with us. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.

PURPORT
In this verse the words apavarga-gurur gatiù are very significant. According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11), the Supreme Lord is the ultimate fact of the Absolute Truth. Brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. The word apavarga means "liberation." Pavarga means "material existence." In material existence, one always works very hard but is ultimately baffled. One then dies and has to accept another body to work very hard again. This is the cycle of material existence. Apavarga means just the opposite. Instead of working hard like cats and dogs, one returns home, back to Godhead. Liberation begins with merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Lord. This conception is held by the jïäné-sampradäya, philosophical speculators, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is higher. When a devotee understands that the Lord is satisfied, liberation, or merging into the effulgence of the Lord, is not very difficult. One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the impersonal Brahman effulgence just as one has to approach the sun through the sunshine. It is not very difficult to merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, Brahman, if one has satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
TEXT 31
varaà våëémahe 'thäpi
nätha tvat parataù parät
na hy antas tvad-vibhüténäà
so 'nanta iti géyase


varam—benediction; våëémahe—we shall pray for; atha api—therefore; nätha—O Lord; tvat—from You; parataù parät—beyond the transcendence; na—not; hi—certainly; antaù—end; tvat—Your; vibhüténäm—of opulences; saù—You; anantaù—unlimited; iti—thus; géyase—are celebrated.

Dear Lord, we shall therefore pray for Your benediction because You are the Supreme, beyond all transcendence, and because there is no end to Your opulences. Consequently, You are celebrated by the name Ananta.

PURPORT
There was no need for the Pracetäs to ask any benediction from the Supreme Lord because the devotees are simply satisfied by the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhruva Mahäräja practiced severe austerities and penances to see the Supreme Lord, and his intention was to receive benediction from the Lord. He wanted to acquire the throne of his father—or attain an even better position—but when he was actually in the presence of the Supreme Lord, he forgot everything. He said, "My dear Lord, I do not wish to ask any benediction." This is the actual position of the devotee. The devotee simply wants to be in the presence of the Supreme Lord—either in this world or in the next—and engage in His service. That is the ultimate goal and benediction for the devotees.
The Lord asked the Pracetäs to pray for some benediction, and they said, "What kind of benediction should we pray for? The Lord is unlimited, and there are unlimited benedictions." The purport is that if one must ask for benediction, he must ask for unlimited benediction. The words tvat parataù are very significant in this verse. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is parataù parät. The word para means "transcendental, beyond this material world." The impersonal Brahman effulgence is beyond this material world, and this is called paraà padam. Äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padam (SB 10.2.32). Merging into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord is called paraà padam, but there is a higher transcendental position, which is the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate (SB 1.2.11). The Absolute Truth is realized first as impersonal Brahman, then as Paramätmä, and finally as Bhagavän. Thus the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, is parataù parät, beyond Brahman and Paramätmä realization. In this connection, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out that parataù parät means "better than the best." The best is the spiritual world, and it is known as Brahman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is known as Para-brahman. Therefore parataù parät means "better than Brahman realization."
As will be explained in the next verses, the Pracetäs planned to ask the Lord for something that has no limit. The Lord's pastimes, qualities, forms and names are all unlimited. There is no limit to His name, forms, pastimes, creation and paraphernalia. The living entity cannot conceive of the unlimitedness of the unlimited. However, if living entities are engaged in hearing about the unlimited potencies of the Supreme Lord, they are factually connected directly to the unlimited. Such understanding of the unlimited becomes unlimited by hearing and chanting.

pärijäte 'ïjasä labdhe
säraìgo 'nyan na sevate
tvad-aìghri-mülam äsädya
säkñät kià kià våëémahi


pärijäte—the celestial tree known as pärijäta; aïjasä—completely; labdhe—having achieved; säraìgaù—a bee; anyat—other; na sevate—does not resort to; tvat-aìghri—Your lotus feet; mülam—the root of everything; äsädya—having approached; säkñät—directly; kim—what; kim—what; våëémahi—may we ask.

Dear Lord, when the bee approaches the celestial tree called the pärijäta, it certainly does not leave the tree, because there is no need for such action. Similarly, when we have approached Your lotus feet and taken shelter of them, what further benediction may we ask of You?

PURPORT
When a devotee is actually engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, his engagement in itself is so perfect that there is no need to ask for further benediction. When a bee approaches the pärijäta tree, it gets unlimited supplies of honey. There is no need to go to another tree. If one is fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is unlimited transcendental bliss, and as such there is no need to ask for further benediction. The pärijäta tree is not commonly found within this material world. The pärijäta tree is also known as kalpa-våkña, or the wish-fulfilling tree. One can get anything he desires from such a tree. In the material world, one can get oranges from an orange tree or mangoes from a mango tree, but there is no possibility of getting oranges from a mango tree or vice versa. However, one can get whatever he wants from the pärijäta tree—oranges, mangoes, bananas and so on. This tree is found in the spiritual world. Cintämaëi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-våkña-lakñävåteñu [Bs. 5.29]. The spiritual world, cintämaëi-dhäma, is surrounded by these kalpa-våkña trees, but the pärijäta tree is also found in the kingdom of Indra, that is, on Indra's heavenly planet. This pärijäta tree was brought by Kåñëa to please Satyabhämä, one of His queens, and this tree was implanted in the Dvärakä mansions constructed for the queens. The lotus feet of the Lord are exactly like the pärijäta trees, or wish-fulfilling trees, and the devotees are like bumblebees. They are always attracted by the lotus feet of the Lord.
TEXT 33
yävat te mäyayä spåñöä
bhramäma iha karmabhiù
tävad bhavat-prasaìgänäà
saìgaù syän no bhave bhave


yävat—as long as; te—Your; mäyayä—by the illusory energy; spåñöäù—contaminated; bhramämaù—we wander; iha—in this material world; karmabhiù—by the reaction of fruitive activities; tävat—so long; bhavat-prasaìgänäm—of Your loving devotees; saìgaù—association; syät—let there be; naù—our; bhave bhave—in every species of life.

Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material contamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, we pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We pray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.

PURPORT
This is the best benediction that a devotee can ask of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu: sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhiù (SB 10.14.3). One may be in one position or another according to destiny, but in any case one must continue to hear about the activities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, regardless of circumstances. A pure devotee does not pray for liberation or for cessation of the cycle of birth and death because he does not consider that important. The most important thing for a devotee is getting a chance to hear about the pastimes and glories of the Lord. The devotees who engage in the service of the Lord in this world will have the same opportunity in the spiritual world also. Thus for a devotee, everything is in the spiritual world, for as long as he can hear about the pastimes of the Lord, or wherever he can chant, the Lord is personally present. Yatra gäyanti mad-bhaktäù tatra tiñöhämi närada. When the pure devotees assemble to chant, hear and talk about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the place where they assemble becomes Vaikuëöha. For the devotee there is no need to pray to the Lord for transferal to the Vaikuëöha world. A pure devotee can create Vaikuëöha or Våndävana anywhere simply by chanting the glories of the Lord without offense.
The Pracetäs pray for an opportunity to hear of the glories of the Lord in every form of life (bhave bhave). A living entity transmigrates from one body to another. The devotee is not particularly eager to stop this process. Caitanya Mahäprabhu prays, mama janmani janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi: "My dear Lord, life after life may I be fixed in Your pure devotional service." Out of humility, a devotee considers himself unfit to be transferred to the spiritual world. He always thinks himself contaminated by the modes of material nature. Nor is there any need for a devotee to ask to be freed from the modes of material nature. Devotional service itself is in the transcendental position; therefore there is no question of asking for this special facility. The conclusion is that a pure devotee is not anxious to stop the repetition of birth and death, but is always eager to associate with other devotees who are engaged in chanting and hearing about the glories of the Lord.
TEXT 34
tulayäma lavenäpi
na svargaà näpunar-bhavam
bhagavat-saìgi-saìgasya
martyänäà kim utäçiñaù


tulayäma—we compare; lavena—with a moment; api—even; na—not; svargam—attainment of the heavenly planets; na—not; apunaù-bhavam—merging into the Brahman effulgence; bhagavat—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; saìgi—with associates; saìgasya—of association; martyänäm—of persons who are destined to die; kim uta—how much less; äçiñaù—benedictions.

Even a moment's association with a pure devotee cannot be compared to being transferred to heavenly planets or even merging into the Brahman effulgence in complete liberation. For living entities who are destined to give up the body and die, association with pure devotees is the highest benediction.

PURPORT
The great saint Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté, a devotee of Lord Caitanya, has stated: kaivalyaà narakäyate tridaça-pür äkäça-puñpäyate. For a pure devotee, kaivalya, merging into the existence of Brahman, the Brahman effulgence, is no better than living in hell. Similarly, he considers promotion to heavenly planets (tridaça-pür) just another kind of phantasmagoria. In other words, a pure devotee does not place much value in the destination of the karmés (the heavenly planets) or in the destination of the jïänés (merging into the Brahman effulgence). A pure devotee considers a moment's association with another pure devotee to be far superior to residing in a heavenly planet or merging in the Brahman effulgence. The topmost benediction for those who are living in this material world and are subjected to the repetition of birth and death (transmigration) is association with pure devotees. One should search out such pure devotees and remain with them. That will make one completely happy, even though living within the material world. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is started for that purpose. A person who is overly affected materially may take advantage of this movement and become intimately associated with it. In this way the confused and frustrated inhabitants of this material world may find the highest happiness in association with devotees.
TEXT 35

yatreòyante kathä måñöäs
tåñëäyäù praçamo yataù
nirvairaà yatra bhüteñu
nodvego yatra kaçcana


yatra—where; éòyante—are worshiped or discussed; kathäù—words; måñöäù—pure; tåñëäyäù—of material hankerings; praçamaù—satisfaction; yataù—by which; nirvairam—nonenviousness; yatra—where; bhüteñu—among living entities; na—not; udvegaù—fear; yatra—where; kaçcana—any.

Whenever pure topics of the transcendental world are discussed, the members of the audience forget all kinds of material hankerings, at least for the time being. Not only that, but they are no longer envious of one another, nor do they suffer from anxiety or fear.

PURPORT
Vaikuëöha means "without anxiety," and the material world means full of anxiety. As stated by Prahläda Mahäräja: sadä samudvigna-dhiyäm asad-grahät [SB 7.5.5]. The living entities who have accepted this material world as a residence are full of anxiety. A place immediately becomes Vaikuëöha whenever the holy topics of the Personality of Godhead are discussed by pure devotees. This is the process of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], chanting and hearing about the Supreme Lord Viñëu. As the Supreme Lord Himself confirms:
nähaà tiñöhämi vaikuëöhe
yoginäà hådayeñu vä
yatra gäyanti mad-bhaktäù
tatra tiñöhämi närada
"My dear Närada, actually I do not reside in My abode, Vaikuëöha, nor do I reside within the hearts of the yogés, but I reside in that place where My pure devotees chant My holy name and discuss My form, pastimes and qualities." Because of the presence of the Lord in the form of the transcendental vibration, the Vaikuëöha atmosphere is evoked. This atmosphere is without fear and anxiety. One living entity does not fear another. By hearing the holy names and glories of the Lord, a person executes pious activities. Çåëvatäà sva-kathäù kåñëaù puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù (SB 1.2.17). Thus his material hankerings immediately stop. This saìkértana movement started by the Society for Krishna Consciousness is meant for creating Vaikuëöha, the transcendental world that is without anxiety, even in this material world. The method is the propagation of the çravaëaà kértanam [SB 7.5.23] process throughout the world. In the material world everyone is envious of his fellow man. Animalistic envy exists in human society as long as there is no performance of saìkértana-yajïa, the chanting of the holy names—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The Pracetäs therefore decided to remain always in the society of devotees, and they considered that to be the highest benediction possible in human life.
TEXT 36
yatra näräyaëaù säkñäd
bhagavän nyäsinäà gatiù
saàstüyate sat-kathäsu
mukta-saìgaiù punaù punaù


yatra—where; näräyaëaù—Lord Näräyaëa; säkñät—directly; bhagavän—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nyäsinäm—of persons in the renounced order of life; gatiù—the ultimate goal; saàstüyate—is worshiped; sat-kathäsu—by discussing the transcendental vibration; mukta-saìgaiù—by those who are liberated from material contamination; punaù punaù—again and again.

The Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa, is present among devotees who are engaged in hearing and chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Näräyaëa is the ultimate goal of sannyäsés, those in the renounced order of life, and Näräyaëa is worshiped through this saìkértana movement by those who are liberated from material contamination. Indeed, they recite the holy name again and again.

PURPORT
The Mäyävädé sannyäsés are missing the real presence of Näräyaëa. This is because they falsely claim to be Näräyaëa Himself. According to the customary etiquette of Mäyävädé sannyäsés, they address one another as Näräyaëa. To say that everyone is a temple of Näräyaëa is correct, but to accept another human being as Näräyaëa is a great offense. The conception of daridra-näräyaëa (poor Näräyaëa), an attempt to identify the poor with Näräyaëa, is also a great offense. Even to identify Näräyaëa with demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva is an offense.
yas tu näräyaëaà devaà
brahma-rudrädi-daivataiù
samatvenaiva vékñeta
sa päñaëòé bhaved dhruvam
 [Cc. Madhya 18.116]
"One who considers Lord Näräyaëa on a level with great demigods like Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva is immediately listed among nonbelievers." The fact is that by performing saìkértana-yajïa one can immediately please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then Näräyaëa Himself descends and immediately is present. In this Age of Kali, Näräyaëa is immediately present in the form of Lord Caitanya. Concerning Lord Caitanya, Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.5.32) states:
kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëaà
säìgopäìgästra-pärñadam
yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair
yajanti hi sumedhasaù
"In the Age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the name of Kåñëa. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Kåñëa Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions." After all, human life is meant for pleasing Näräyaëa, and this can easily be done by performing saìkértana-yajïa. Whenever there is congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Gaura Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, immediately appears and is worshiped by saìkértana-yajïa.
In this verse it is said that Näräyaëa is nyäsinäà gatiù, the ultimate goal of the sannyäsés. The goal of those who have renounced the material world is the attainment of Näräyaëa. A Vaiñëava sannyäsé therefore dedicates his life to serving Näräyaëa; he does not falsely claim to be Näräyaëa. Instead of becoming nirvaira (nonenvious of other living entities), one who tries to become Näräyaëa becomes envious of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the attempt to become Näräyaëa constitutes the greatest offense. Actually, when one chants or discusses the transcendental activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes nonenvious. In this material world everyone is envious of everyone else, but by vibrating or discussing the holy name of the Lord, one becomes nonenvious and devoid of material hankering. Because of our envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have become envious of all other living entities. When we are no longer envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be real peace, unity and fraternity in human society. Without Näräyaëa or saìkértana-yajïa there cannot be peace in this material world.
TEXT 37
teñäà vicaratäà padbhyäà

teñäm—of them; vicaratäm—who travel; padbhyäm—by their feet; térthänäm—the holy places; pävana-icchayä—with a desire to purify; bhétasya—to the materialistic person who is always fearful; kim—why; na—not; roceta—becomes pleasing; tävakänäm—of Your devotees; samägamaù—meeting.

Dear Lord, Your personal associates, devotees, wander all over the world to purify even the holy places of pilgrimage. Is not such activity pleasing to those who are actually afraid of material existence?

PURPORT
There are two kinds of devotees. One is called goñöhyänandé and the other bhajanänandé. The word bhajanänandé refers to the devotee who does not move, but remains in one place. Such a devotee is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He chants the mahä-mantra as taught by many äcäryas and sometimes goes out for preaching work. The goñöhyänandé is one who desires to increase the number of devotees all over the world. He travels all over the world just to purify the world and the people residing in it. Caitanya Mahäprabhu advised:
påthivéte äche yata nagarädi gräma
sarvatra pracära haibe mora näma
 [CB Antya-khaëòa 4.126] 
Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted His followers to move all over the world to preach in every town and village. In the Caitanya-sampradäya those who strictly follow the principles of Lord Caitanya must travel all over the world to preach the message of Lord Caitanya, which is the same as preaching the words of Kåñëa—Bhagavad-gétä—and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The more the devotees preach the principles of kåñëa-kathä, the more people throughout the world will benefit.
Devotees like the great sage Närada, who travel all over to preach, are called goñöhyänandé. Närada Muni is always wandering throughout the universe just to create different types of devotees. Närada even made a hunter a devotee. He also made Dhruva Mahäräja and Prahläda devotees. Actually, all devotees are indebted to the great sage Närada, for he has wandered both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord is not even afraid of hell. He goes to preach the glories of the Lord everywhere—even in hell—because there is no distinction between heaven and hell for a devotee.
näräyaëa-paräù sarve
na kutaçcana bibhyati
svargäpavarga-narakeñv
api tulyärtha-darçinaù
"A pure devotee of Näräyaëa is never afraid of going anywhere and everywhere. For him heaven and hell are one and the same." (SB 6.17.28) Such devotees, wandering all over the world, deliver those who are actually afraid of this material existence. Some people are already disgusted with material existence, being confused and frustrated by material enjoyment, and some people, who are intelligent, are interested in understanding the Supreme Lord. Both may take advantage of the pure devotee who wanders throughout the world.
When a pure devotee goes to a place of pilgrimage, he desires to purify that holy place of pilgrimage. Many sinful men bathe in the holy waters of the places of pilgrimage. They take their baths in the waters of the Ganges and Yamunä at places such as Prayäga, Våndävana and Mathurä. In this way the sinful men are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee comes to take his bath at those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are neutralized by the devotee. Térthé-kurvanti térthäni sväntaù-sthena gadä-bhåtä (SB 1.13.10). Because the devotee always carries the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes becomes a place of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure devotee and thus attain freedom from material contamination. Everyone should take advantage of the wandering devotees, whose only business is to deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of mäyä.

vayaà tu säkñäd bhagavan bhavasya
priyasya sakhyuù kñaëa-saìgamena
suduçcikitsyasya bhavasya måtyor
bhiñaktamaà tvädya gatià gatäù sma


vayam—we; tu—then; säkñät—directly; bhagavan—O Lord; bhavasya—of Lord Çiva; priyasya—very dear; sakhyuù—Your friend; kñaëa—for a moment; saìgamena—by association; suduçcikitsyasya—very difficult to cure; bhavasya—of material existence; måtyoù—of death; bhiñak-tamam—the most expert physician; tvä—You; adya—today; gatim—destination; gatäù—have achieved; sma—certainly.

Dear Lord, by virtue of a moment's association with Lord Çiva, who is very dear to You and who is Your most intimate friend, we were fortunate to attain You. You are the most expert physician, capable of treating the incurable disease of material existence. On account of our great fortune, we have been able to take shelter at Your lotus feet.

PURPORT
It has been said: harià vinä na måtià taranti. Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, one cannot attain relief from the clutches of mäyä, the repetition of birth, old age, disease and death. The Pracetäs received the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is the supreme devotee of Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaiñëavänäà yathä çambhuù: the most exalted Vaiñëava is Lord Çiva, and those who are actually devotees of Lord Çiva follow Lord Çiva's advice and take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu. The so-called devotees of Lord Çiva, who are simply after material prosperity, are in a way deceived by Lord Çiva. He does not actually deceive them, because Lord Çiva has no business deceiving people, but because the so-called devotees of Lord Çiva want to be deceived, Lord Çiva, who is very easily pleased, allows them all kinds of material benedictions. These benedictions might ironically result in the destruction of the so-called devotees. For instance, Rävaëa took all material benediction from Lord Çiva, but the result was that he was ultimately destroyed with his family, kingdom and everything else because he misused Lord Çiva's benediction. Because of his material power, he became very proud and puffed up so that he dared kidnap the wife of Lord Rämacandra. In this way he was ruined. To get material benedictions from Lord Çiva is not difficult, but actually these are not benedictions. The Pracetäs received benediction from Lord Çiva, and as a result they attained the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Viñëu. This is real benediction. The gopés also worshiped Lord Çiva in Våndävana, and the lord is still staying there as Gopéçvara. The gopés, however, prayed that Lord Çiva bless them by giving them Lord Kåñëa as their husband. There is no harm in worshiping the demigods, provided that one's aim is to return home, back to Godhead. Generally people go to the demigods for material benefit, as indicated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.20):
kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù
prapadyante 'nya-devatäù
taà taà niyamam ästhäya
prakåtyä niyatäù svayä
"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures." One enamored with material benefits is called håta jïäna ("one who has lost his intelligence"). In this connection it is to be noted that sometimes in revealed scriptures Lord Çiva is described as being nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu are so intimately connected that there is no difference in opinion. The actual fact is, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya: "The only supreme master is Kåñëa, and all others are His devotees or servants." (Cc. Ädi 5.142) This is the real fact, and there is no difference of opinion between Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu in this connection. Nowhere in revealed scripture does Lord Çiva claim to be equal to Lord Viñëu. This is simply the creation of the so-called devotees of Lord Çiva, who claim that Lord Çiva and Lord Viñëu are one. This is strictly forbidden in the Vaiñëava-tantra: yas tu näräyaëaà devam [Cc. Madhya 18.116]. Lord Viñëu, Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are intimately connected as master and servants. Çiva-viriïci-nutam [SB 11.5.33]. Viñëu is honored and offered obeisances by Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä. To consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the sense that Lord Viñëu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others are His eternal servants.

Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brähmaëas, advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.

PURPORT
As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, saàsiddhir hari-toñaëam: [SB 1.2.13] the real perfection of life is pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: [Bg. 15.15] in understanding the Vedas, one has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who has actually understood Him surrenders unto Him after many, many births. We find all these qualifications in the Pracetäs. They underwent severe austerities and penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long time. They practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One may engage in any business—material or spiritual—but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of Vedic civilization. People training to become devotees should be respectful not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also to those who are elderly in knowledge, who are Äryans and actual devotees of the Lord. An Äryan is one who does not boast but is an actual devotee of the Lord. Äryan means "advanced." Formerly, those who claimed to be Äryans had to be devotees of the Lord. For instance, in Bhagavad-gétä (2.2) Kåñëa chastised Arjuna by saying that he was speaking like a non-Äryan.
çré-bhagavän uväca
kutas tvä kaçmalam idaà
viñame samupasthitam
anärya-juñöam asvargyam
akérti-karam arjuna
"The Supreme Person [Bhagavän] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy." Arjuna, the kñatriya, was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered by the Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a non-Äryan family. Anyone who is advanced in the devotional service of the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether his duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed. An Äryan performs his duty. It is not that the Äryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The Äryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The Pracetäs underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within the water. Accepting austerities and penances is the avowed business of those interested in advanced civilization.
The word nirandhasäm means "without food." Eating voraciously and unnecessarily is not the business of an Äryan. Rather, the eating process should be restricted as far as possible. When Äryans eat, they eat only prescribed eatables. Regarding this, the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.26):
patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà
yo me bhaktyä prayacchati
tad ahaà bhakty-upahåtam
açnämi prayatätmanaù
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." Thus there are restrictions for the advanced Äryans. Although the Lord Himself can eat anything and everything, He restricts Himself to vegetables, fruits, milk and so on. This verse thus describes the activities of those who claim to be Äryans.

Dear Lord, even great yogés and mystics who are very much advanced by virtue of austerities and knowledge and who have completely situated themselves in pure existence, as well as great personalities like Manu, Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, cannot fully understand Your glories and potencies. Nonetheless they have offered their prayers according to their own capacities. In the same way, we, although much lower than these personalities, also offer our prayers according to our own capability.

PURPORT
Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva, Manu (the father of mankind), great saintly persons and also great sages who have elevated themselves to the transcendental platform through austerities and penance, as well as devotional service, are imperfect in knowledge compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the case with anyone within this material world. No one can be equal to the Supreme Lord in anything, certainly not in knowledge. Consequently, anyone's prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never complete. It is not possible to measure the complete glories of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimited. Even the Lord Himself in His incarnation as Ananta, or Çeña, cannot describe His own glories. Although Ananta has many thousands of faces and has been glorifying the Lord for many, many years, He could not find the limit of the glories of the Lord. Thus it is not possible to estimate the complete potencies and glories of the Supreme Lord.
Nonetheless, everyone in devotional service can offer essential prayers to the Lord. Everyone is situated in a relative position, and no one is perfect in glorifying the Lord. Beginning with Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva down to ourselves, everyone is the servant of the Supreme Lord. We are all situated in relative positions according to our own karma. Yet every one of us can offer prayers with heart and soul as far as we can appreciate the Lord's glories. That is our perfection. Even when one is in the darkest region of existence, he is allowed to offer prayers to the Lord according to his own capacity. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.32):
mäà hi pärtha vyapäçritya
ye 'pi syuù päpa-yonayaù
striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs
te 'pi yänti paräà gatim
"O son of Påthä, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth—women, vaiçyas [merchants], as well as çüdras [workers]—can approach the supreme destination."
If one seriously accepts the lotus feet of the Lord, he is purified by the grace of the Lord and by the grace of the Lord's servant. This is confirmed by Çukadeva Gosvämé: ye 'nye ca päpä yad-apäçrayäçrayäù çudhyanti tasmai prabhaviñëave namaù (SB 2.4.18). One who is brought under the lotus feet of the Lord by the endeavor of the Lord's servant, the spiritual master, is certainly immediately purified, however lowborn he may be. He becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.
TEXT 42
namaù samäya çuddhäya
puruñäya paräya ca
väsudeväya sattväya
tubhyaà bhagavate namaù


namaù—we offer our respectful obeisances; samäya—who is equal to everyone; çuddhäya—who is never contaminated by sinful activities; puruñäya—unto the Supreme Person; paräya—transcendental; ca—also; väsudeväya—living everywhere; sattväya—who is in the transcendental position; tubhyam—unto You; bhagavate—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; namaù—obeisances.

Dear Lord, You have no enemies or friends. Therefore You are equal to everyone. You cannot be contaminated by sinful activities, and Your transcendental form is always beyond the material creation. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead because You remain everywhere within all existence. You are consequently known as Väsudeva. We offer You our respectful obeisances.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Väsudeva because He lives everywhere. The word vas means "to live." As stated in Brahma-saàhitä, eko 'py asau racayituà jagad-aëòa-koöim: [Bs. 5.35] the Lord, through His plenary portion, enters into each and every universe to create the material manifestation. He also enters into each and every heart in all living entities and into each and every atom also (paramäëu-cayäntara-stham). Because the Supreme Lord lives everywhere, He is known as Väsudeva. Although He lives everywhere within the material world, He is not contaminated by the modes of nature. The Lord is therefore described in Éçopaniñad as apäpa-viddham. He is never contaminated by the modes of material nature. When the Lord descends to this planet, He acts in many ways. He kills demons and performs acts not sanctioned by the Vedic principles, that is, acts considered sinful. Even though He acts in such a way, He is never contaminated by His action. He is therefore described herein as çuddha, meaning "always free from contamination." The Lord is also sama, equal to everyone. In this regard, He states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.29), samo'haà sarva-bhüteñu na me dveñyo 'sti na priyaù: the Lord has no one as His friend or enemy, and He is equal to everyone.
The word sattväya indicates that the form of the Lord is not material. It is sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù [Bs. 5.1]. His body is different from our material bodies. One should not think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has a material body, like ours.
