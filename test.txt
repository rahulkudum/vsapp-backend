1) i worship sri radhika whose beautiful eyes flicker in all directions like restless playful wagtail birds who is the malli flower for the honeybee heart of the son of the cowherd king (krsna) and who is deep with all attributes
2) i worship sri radhika who spreads the fame of her father vrsabhanu maharajas well thoughout the world and who plays with her girlfriends and the prince of vraja in her own beautiful (or fragrant) pond
3) i worship sri radhika whose smiling submissive face is initiated in a vow to subdue the glories of the full autumnal moon (the lord of the lilies) whose erotic pastimes are expanded by krsnas naughty side long glances and who wears waves of elegance on her body
4) i worship sri radhika whose braided hair which is filled with various kinds of blooming flowers resembles the spread out tail of a peacock that is dizzy of amorous feelings and whose spotless cheeks are coloured red with the pan that emanated from madhuripus (krsnas) mouth”
5) i worship sri radhika whose heart is sprinkled by pure intimate affection for lalita whose all round mood of friendship for visakha is well known who is a box filled with priceless jewels of love for krsna and who is sweetly playful

7) i worship sri radhika who looks upon even the backs of the extreme borders of haris toe nails as being dearer to her than millions of hearts who is the guru who initiates all the joyful restless eyed girls in the art of cleverness and whose glories are great
8) i worship sri radhika whose luster is of pure gold like vermillion crushed on a golden slab whose adolescent beauty is surrounded by waves of sweetness who gets goosepimples of ecstasy when she is embraced by haris arms and who wears a bright crimson dress
9) the moon of auspiciousness on the bank of the daughter of the sun (yamuna) sri krsnacandra will be satisfied with whoever nicely recites this best of prayers radhastakam that is a spotless reservoir of erotic sweetness and he will fulfill all the reciters desires

kakhana maribe kemane taribe visama samana ḍake
jahara pratape bhuvana kapaye na jani mara vipake
(3)
kula dhana paiya unmatta haiya apanake jana baḍa

translation
1) o my dear mind with staunch faith perform hari bhajana without which you cannot be delivered and with your mouth chant the names of vrajendra nandana gopi prana dhana (the life and wealth of the gopis) and syamasundara whose beauty en chants the whole material manifestation
2) there is no certainty when your life will finish and you also never think about your deliverance from the material world but very fearsome yamadutas are standing near you bhagavan whose power causes the three worlds to tremble in fear you have forgotten this is your misfortune thus you are suffering in this material world from different kinds of miseries and now you are about to die
3) you have become intoxicated by your high birth and wealth thinking yourself very high class but you have forgotten that one day the yamadutas will take you tying up your hands and feet
4) so whether one is a sannyasi or a very low caste person without performing hari bhajana one will continue to rotate in the samsara and go to the hell named raurava
5) locana dasa says “i have never done any hari bhajana having been absorbed in sense enjoyment in this way my human form of life has been wasted and this causes excruciating pain like a thorn piercing my heart

translation
1) bhismadeva said: let me now invest my thinking feeling and willing which were so long engaged in different subjects and occupational duties in the all powerful lord sri krsna he is always self satisfied but sometimes being the leader of the devotees he enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending to the material world although it is from him only that the material world is created
2) sri krsna is the intimate friend of arjuna he has appeared on this earth in his transcendental body which resembles the bluish color of the tamala tree his body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems [upper middle and lower] may his glittering yellow dress and his lotus face covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp be the object of my attraction and may i not desire fruitive results
3) on the battlefield [where sri krsna attended arjuna out of friendship] the flowing hair of lord krsna turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hoofs of the horses and because of his labor beads of sweat wetted his face all these decorations intensified by the wounds on his skin dealt by my sharp arrows were enjoyed by him let my mind thus go unto sri krsna
4) in obedience to the command of his friend lord sri krsna entered the arena of the battlefield of kuruksetra between the soldiers of arjuna and duryodhana and while there he shortened the life spans of the opposite party by his merciful glance this was done simply by his looking at the enemy let my mind be fixed upon that krsna
5) when arjuna was seemingly polluted by ignorance upon observing the soldiers and commanders before him on the battlefield the lord eradicated his ignorance by delivering transcendental knowledge may his lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction
6) fulfilling my vow and sacrificing his own promise he got down from the chariot took up its wheel and ran towards me hurriedly just as a lion goes to kill an elephant he even dropped his outer garment on the way
7) may he lord sri krsna the personality of godhead who awards salvation be my ultimate destination on the battlefield he charged me as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows his shield was scattered and his body was smeared with blood due to the wounds
8) at the moment of death let my ultimate attraction be to sri krsna the personality of godhead i concentrate my mind upon arjunas chariot driver who stood with a whip in his right hand and a bridle rope in his left and who was very careful to give protection to arjunas chariot by all means those who saw him on the battlefield of kuruksetra attained their original forms after death
9) let my mind be fixed upon lord sri krsna whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of vrajadhama [the gopis] the damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the lord [after his disappearance from the rasa dance]
10) at the rajasuya yajna [sacrifice] performed by maharaja yudhisthira there was the greatest assembly of all the elite men of the world the royal and learned orders and in that great assembly lord sri krsna was worshiped by one and all as the most exalted personality of godhead this happened during my presence and i remember the incident in order to keep my mind upon the lord
11) now i can meditate with full concentration upon that one lord sri krsna now present before me because now i have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to his presence in everyones heart even in the hearts of the mental speculators he is in everyones heart the sun may be perceived differently but the sun is one
