hare krsna mahamantra
hare krsna hare krsna
krsna krsna hare hare
hare rama hare rama
rama rama hare hare
purport by his divine grace a c bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada
the transcendental vibration established by the chanting of hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare is the sublime method of reviving our krsna consciousness as living spiritual souls we are all originally krsna conscious entities but due to our association with matter from time immemorial our consciousness is now polluted by the material atmosphere the material atmosphere in which we are now living is called maya or illusion maya means that which is not and what is this illusion the illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material nature while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws when a servant artificially tries to imitate the all powerful master this is called illusion in this polluted concept of life we are all trying to exploit the resources of material nature but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities therefore although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature we are ever more dependent on her this illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our krsna consciousness
krsna consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind this consciousness is the original energy of the living entity when we hear the transcendental vibration this consciousness is revived and this process is recommended for this age by authorities by practical experience also one can perceive that by chanting this maha mantra or the great chanting for deliverance one can at once feel a transcendental ecstasy coming through from the spiritual stratum and when one is factually on the plane of spiritual understandingsurpassing the stages of senses mind and intelligenceone is situated on the transcendental plane this chanting of hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare is directly enacted from the spiritual platform and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciousness namely sensual mental and intellectual there is no need therefore to understand the language of the mantra nor is there any need for mental speculation or any intellectual adjustment for chanting this mahamantra it springs automatically from the spiritual platform and as such anyone can take part in the chanting without any previous qualification and dance in ecstasy
we have seen this practically even a child can take part in the chanting or even a dog can take part in it of course for one who is too entangled in material life it takes a little more time to come to the standard point but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly when the mantra is chanted by a pure devotee of the lord in love it has the greatest efficacy on the hearers and as such this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the lord so that immediate effects can be achieved as far as possible chanting from the lips of non devotees should be avoided milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects
the word hara is the form of addressing the energy of the lord and the words krsna and rama are forms of addressing the lord himself both krsna and rama mean the supreme pleasure and hara is the supreme pleasure energy of the lord changed to hare in the vocative the supreme pleasure energy of the lord helps us to reach the lord
the material energy called maya is also one of the multi energies of the lord and we the living entities are also the energymarginal energyof the lord the living entities are described as superior to material energy when the superior energy is in contact with the inferior energy an incompatible situation arises but when the superior marginal energy is in contact with the superior energy called hara the living entity is established in his happy normal condition
these three words namely hare krsna and rama are the transcendental seeds of the mahamantra the chanting is a spiritual call for the lord and his internal energy hara to give protection to the conditioned soul this chanting is exactly like the genuine cry of a child for its mother mother hara helps the devotee achieve the grace of the supreme father hari or krsna and the lord reveals himself to the devotee who chants this mantra sincerely
no other means of spiritual realization therefore is as effective in this age as chanting the mahamantra hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare

2 chanting the holy name dancing in ecstasy singing and playing musical instruments the spiritual master is always gladdened by the sańkirtana movement of lord caitanya mahaprabhu because he is relishing the mellows of pure devotion within his mind sometimes his hair stands on end he feels quivering in his body and tears flow from his eyes like waves i offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master

1 glory to the srikrsnasankirtana which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life of repeated birth and death this sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon it is the life of all transcendental knowledge it increases the ocean of transcendental bliss and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious
2 o my lord your holy name alone can render all benediction to living beings and thus you have hundreds and millions of names like krsna and govinda in these transcendental names you have invested all your transcendental energies there are not even hard and fast rules for chanting these names o my lord out of kindness you enable us to easily approach you by your holy names but i am so unfortunate that i have no attraction for them
3 one should chant the holy name of the lord in a humble state of mind thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street one should be more tolerant than a tree devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respect to others in such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the lord constantly
4 o almighty lord i have no desire to accumulate wealth nor do i desire beautiful women nor do i want any number of followers i only want your causeless devotional service birth after birth
5 o son of maharaja nanda krsna i am your eternal servitor yet somehow or other i have fallen into the ocean of birth and death please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at your lotus feet
6 o my lord when will my eyes be decorated with tears of love flowing constantly when i chant your holy name when will my voice choke up and when will the hairs of my body stand on end at the recitation of your name
7 o govinda feeling your separations i am considering a moment to be like twelve years or more tears are flowing from my eyes like torrents of rain and i am feeling all vacant in the world in your absence
8 i know no one but krsna as my lord and he shall remain so even if he handles me roughly by his embrace or makes me brokenhearted by not being present before me he is completely free to do anything and everything for he is always my worshipful lord unconditionally

17 the external potency maya who is of the nature of the shadow of the cit potency is worshiped by all people as durga the creating preserving and destroying agency of this mundane world i adore the primeval lord govinda in accordance with whose will durga conducts herself

22 i adore the primeval lord govinda from whom the separated subjective portion brahma receives his power for the regulation of the mundane world just as the sun manifests some portion of his own light in all the effulgent gems that bear the names of suryakanta etc
23 i adore the primeval lord govinda whose lotus feet are always held by ganesa upon the pair of tumuli protruding from his elephant head in order to obtain power for his function of destroying all the obstacles on the path of progress of the three worlds
24 the three worlds are composed of the nine elements viz fire earth ether water air direction time soul and mind i adore the primeval lord govinda from whom they originate in whom they exist and into whom they enter at the time of the universal cataclysm

28 i adore the primeval lord govinda the meditators of whom by meditating upon him under the sway of wrath amorous passion natural friendly love fear parental affection delusion reverence and willing service attain to bodily forms befitting the nature of their contemplation
29 i worship that transcendental seat known as svetadvipa where as loving consorts the laksmis in their unalloyed spiritual essence practice the amorous service of the supreme lord krishna as their only lover where every tree is a transcendental purpose tree where the soil is the purpose gem all water is nectar every word is a song every gait is a dance the flute is the favorite attendant effulgence is full of transcendental bliss and the supreme spiritual entities are all enjoyable and tasty where numberless milk cows always emit transcendental oceans of milk where there is eternal existence of transcendental time who is ever present and without past or future and hence is not subject to the quality of passing away even for the space of half a moment that realm is known as goloka only to a very few selfrealized souls in this world

6 by what means will i get those lotus feet since i am completely bereft of fruitive activities bereft of knowledge and bereft of any kind of devotion to krsna
7 my only hope is your compassion for the opinion of all the vedas is that your compassion is causeless
8 you are the very abode of purity and i am most wicked and evilminded so how will i attain the shelter of your lotus feet
9 weeping and weeping this fallen and most contemptible person says dear lord all i know is that your most celebrated name is patitapavana the deliverer of the fallen

1 o you have so much to say about being genuine you are seen to be wrapped in an old tattered blanket and wearing a simple loincloth just like a renounced ascetic  but in actuality all of this is simply pretentious
2 leaving your legally married wife at home you go off and keep the company of the wives of others in your greed for acquiring more and more wealth you wander like a poor beggar from door to door and you secretly keep so many surpluses stored away
3 you are quite confident in presenting yourself as a saintly spiritual master and thus you are busily engaged in initiating innocent people by reciting krishnanama into their ear  is this behavior not a great charade
4 can anyone be called a guru simply because he gives advice to others a cook can never use whey in a recipe that calls for milk now think about this and just see what i see

3 sri radhika and lord govindaji are decorated with many shining jewels and pearls inlaid with gold artwork enhancing the sparkling splendor of each and every limb of their transcendental forms
4 the meeting of their two bodily forms has generated a luster that brightens all the worlds and may be compared to a garland of lightning radha fixed upon a dark blue raincloud krsna
5 on the occasion of their meeting there is a concert produced by the sounding of conchshells bells karatalas and mrdangas such kirtana is supremely sweet and relishable to hear
6 the cowherd damsels of vrndavana led by visakha devi sing the glories of the divine couple while the priyanarmasakhis cool their lordships by waving camara fans
7 ananga manjari offers them sandalwood pulp scented with cuya while rupa manjari places a garland of jasmine flowers about their necks
8 the beautiful lalita sundari holds a lamp of five flames scented with camphor and waves it aloft offering arati to the divine couple
9 parvati laksmi and the personified vedas cry in great happiness while rolling on the ground and singing of the fortunate position of the damsels of vrajabhumi

3 lord nityananda the proprietor of the market seeing all the devotees become attracted is selling them the holy name after bargaining with them
4 o brother if you want to buy the holy name then go with me we must go to the presence of that great soul nityananda
5 you will buy the name of krsna i will take my commission and all of our desires will be fulfilled
6 lord nityananda is greatly merciful taking only ones faith he gives the highest ecstasy
7 if nitai sees only once tears in the eyes while chanting the name gaura then he gives all resources to that person
8 he gives the pure teachings of krsna to everyone and does not care for ones birth wealth knowledge and strength
9 now giving up the illusory snare of maya either remain in household life or in the forest as a sannyasi for no more troubles remain
10 there is no more fear of the age of kali the merciful nityananda gives the holy name to even the candalas
11 bhaktivinoda calls out except for the lotus feet of lord nityananda there is no other shelter

2 oh such a merciful personality as nityananda prabhu is not to be found anywhere he suffers a beating from jagai and madhai and still gives them the love of god oh when your offenses are being vanquished you will obtain the treasure of love of god but in these names of caitanya and nitai there is no consideration of offenses once you have a taste for the holy name of krsna bondage to this world will come to an end
3 oh when there is attachment to the holy name of krsna the life of a living being very easily becomes successful oh without affection for krsna life is simply useless at the end of life you will obtain the beautiful vision of radha and syama in vrndavana  but only when the mercy of lord gaura is first received oh

1 the human form of life is the rarest opportunity for attaining spiritual perfection but now i am lamenting because ive somehow or other been born with such an opportunity and i wasted it by never worshiping lord krsna oh to whom shall i tell the tale of this misery
2 having married and entered into the entanglements of materialistic family life i passed my time in vain i never got any tangible gain or permanent benefit only trouble and botheration
3 what kind of world is this anyway it seems to be just like a magic lantern show that i saw at a carnival wherein so many shadows and optical illusions dance magically before my eyes i feel great attachment and identification with such a world and thus day after day passby fruitlessly without any purpose whatsoever
4 when this body drops dead on the ground then what will remain mine at that moment all of my sons and dearest loved ones will not be able to give me any happiness
5 i work hard just like an ass everyday and now i am wondering for whom am i working so hard i am still surrounded by so many illusions
6 i waste every day in useless insignificant work and i waste every night controlled by sleep and in every 24 hours i never for one second consider that cruel death is sitting very close by my side
7 i live a very carefree lifestyle sometimes eating a lot or eating a little if i feel like it sometimes i see nice things around the town or sometimes i do not go out at all sometimes i wear opulent clothing or if im in the mood ill wear something simple i live so carefree that i never consider that one day i will have to give up this body
8 my poor heart is plagued by constant anxieties about the maintenance and daily turmoil created by my body my house my wife my family members and my social obligations all these anxieties are pinching me and destroying all my intelligence
9 alas alas what a remorseful situation has arisen i am absorbed in all this trouble but i never consider that all these things are temporary and subject to perish very soon after im dead and gone where will all of my material opulences remain
10 when my body will be thrown in the pit at the cremation grounds it will simply lie there motionlessly then many crows vultures ants and worms will come and playfully sport there
11 all the stray dogs and jackals will then become very much delighted and in great ecstasy they will make a festival ground out of my body and will have a huge celebration and feast
12 just see this is the ultimate destination of this material body and the most amazing thing is that all of my material opulences house family and friends have exactly the same destination
13 therefore i ask of anyone who has any sharp intelligence please give up all of these temporary illusions presented by maya and kindly search after the means to get pure devotion to lord krsna for this is the only really tangible eternal truth

1 when oh when will i wander here and there weeping under the shade of the trees and creepers along the banks of the celestial ganges river in navadvipa i will cry out oh radhe oh krsna and i will completely forget about all the socalled pleasures of this material body
2 when will i be able to live so simply by begging some food from the homes of the untouchables who live here and there i will drink the water of the sarasvati and in ecstasy i will roll to and fro on the banks of the river raising a loud uproar of krsna krsna
3 when will i bow down to all the inhabitants of the holy land of navadvipa and receive a bit of their causeless mercy i will smear the dust of the vaisnavas lotus feet all over my body and i will wear the dress of a mad wandering mendicant
4 when i factually observe that the transcendental land of navadvipa is non different from sri vrajabhumi then i shall be transformed into a vrajabasi also then i will see the true form of the transcendental realm opening up before my very eyes and i will thus become one of the maidservants of srimati radharani

5 thus repeatedly sobbing and calling out i will roam all over the abode of 32 square miles sometimes on one bank of the ganga and sometime on the other and sometimes while wandering about if i ever receive a drop of good fortune i may suddenly glance over at the base of a tree and behold some vision there   
6 i will blurt out ha ha how wonderful what amazing thing have i seen now and i will faint senseless on the spot regaining consciousness later i will hide and weep secretly remembering that all this ecstasy is due to receiving just a tiny speck of sri sri gauranitais mercy

1 listen my dear mind i dont like this material world at all it is simply filled with the suffering of birth death disease and old age besides all this suffering tell me now that good thing could possibly be found here
2 wealth followers and family members they can never really belong to anyone for a time they are together and afterwards they all drift apart all these relationships which you would love to hold on to none of them will remain for long my dear mind oh brother know it for sure that all these temporary things are flimsy and perishable
3 the lifespan of one living in this world is extremely short and even that gradually decays more and more until one beholds yamaraja hovering nearby afflicted with continuous diseases and lamenting in heartbroken grief his consciousness thus degrades more and more finally one meets his downfall and he again suffers the calamity of separation from his dear kinsmen
4 just see here my dear brother dont go for this mixed pain and pleasure of socalled material happiness for it is actually the source of all your troubles if this is the real situation then why have you become the slave of maya just on account of this miserable socalled happiness do you realize what youve done if you become the slave of maya then you only rob yourself of the eternal treasure waiting for you the supreme goal of life
5 just become a little thoughtful for once and reflect back on your own life story how many demoniac temptations you were motivated by simply to get a little sense gratification how many unlimitedly sinful acts have you committed so now just see the result the only gain in the long run is your certain death
6 alas never having once considered the purpose or goal of human existence such a person wastes his entire life just like a dog or a pig then at the time of death being bereft and cheated out of any means of deliverance he laments bitterly and burning the fire of repentance
7 my dear mind so tell me why you remain stupefied and unconscious absorbed in this useless temporary sense gratification i want you to give it up right now and give up all hopes for future sense gratification as well for the expectation of this humble servant is that you will be able to conquer over this miserable material existence by being firmly situated under the protection offered by the lotus feet of sri guru your most wellwishing spiritual master

3 the ways of saranagati are humility dedication of the self acceptance of the lord as ones only maintainer faith that krishna will surely protect
4 execution of only those acts favorable to pure devotion and renunciation of conduct adverse to pure devotion
5 the youthful son of nanda maharaja sri krishna hears the prayers of anyone who takes refuge in him by this sixfold practice

1 i have no devotion for either the vaisnavas or my own spiritual master how is it possible for a rascal like me to attain devotional service

1 vrndavana is filled with blossoming flowers the dancing of peacocks and the sounds of cuckoos and bumblebees when in the association of the dear gopis will i melodiously sing in a charming cottage in a grove of vrndavana
2 when seeing the slowly and gracefully moving divine couple will my hairs stand on end because of the ecstasy in my heart
3 when in the company of the gopis will srimati radharani gesture that she wants me to comb her hair and when will i then take the comb in my hand and carefully comb her curling locks
4 when will i anoint srimati radharanis limbs with sandalwood paste and musk when will i give her beautiful garlands when will i gaze on her moonlike face as i decorate it with tilaka markings drawn in sandalwood paste and kunkuma
5 when will i carefully dress srimati radharani in blue garments when will i place jewelled anklets on her feet when will i take water from a jar and wash her reddish lotus feet when will i then dry her feet using my own hair as a towel
6 when will i make a couch of lotus petals for the divine couple when will i gently fan them with a white camara whisk
7 when from a golden box will i take betelnuts and camphor and place them in the lotus mouths of the divine couple when will i carefully chew the aromatic remnants of such betelnuts which have become mixed with nectar from mouths of the divine couple
8 o lokanatha gosvami o my spiritual master o friend of the poor and wretched conditioned souls o ocean of mercy please hear the appeal of this person who is very miserable and poorhearted o radha and krsna o holy land of vrndavana o intimate gopifriends of the divine couple i beg that you all grant this charity to me please fulfil these desires

1 the lotus feet of lord nityananda are a shelter where one will get the soothing moonlight not only of one but of millions of moons if the world wants to have real peace it should take shelter of lord nityananda unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of lord nityananda it will be very difficult for him to approach radhakrsna if one actually wants to enter into the dancing party of radhakrsna he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of lord nityananda
2 anyone who has not established his relationship with nityananda prabhu is understood to have spoiled his valuable human birth such a human being is actually an uncontrollable animal because he never uttered the holy name of nityananda he has become merged into socalled material happiness what can his useless education and family tradition do to help him
3 being maddened after false prestige and identification with the body one is thinking oh what is nityananda what can he do for me i dont care the result is that he is accepting something false to be truth if you actually want to approach the association of radhakrsna you must first achieve the mercy of lord nityananda when he is merciful toward you then you will be able to approach radhakrsna therefore you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of lord nityananda
4 the lotus feet of nityananda are not illusion they are a fact one who engages in the transcendental loving service of nityananda is also transcendental always try to catch the lotus feet of lord nityananda this narottama dasa is very unhappy therefore i am praying to lord nityananda to make me happy my dear lord please keep me close to your lotus feet

1 my dear lord krishna you are so kind upon this useless soul but i do not know why you have brought me here now you can do whatever you like with me
2 but i guess you have some business here otherwise why would you bring me to this terrible place
3 most of the population here is covered by the material modes of ignorance and passion absorbed in material life they think themselves very happy and satisfied and therefore they have no taste for the transcendental message of vasudeva i do not know how they will be able to understand it
4 but i know your causeless mercy can make everything possible because you are the most expert mystic
5 how will they understand the mellows of devotional service o lord i am simply praying for your mercy so that i will be able to convince them about your message
6 all living entities have come under the control of the illusory energy by your will and therefore if you like by your will they can also be released from the clutches of illusion
7 i wish that you may deliver them therefore if you so desire their deliverance then only will they be able to understand your message
8 the words of srimadbhagavatam are your incarnation and if a sober person repeatedly receives it with submissive aural reception then he will be able to understand your message
9 it is said in the srimadbhagavatam 121721sri krishna the personality of godhead who is the paramatma supersoul in everyones heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear his messages which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted by regular attendance in classes on the bhagavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service unto the personality of godhead who is praised with transcendental songs is established as an irrevocable fact as soon as irrevocable loving service is established in the heart the effects of natures modes of passion and ignorance such as lust desire and hankering disappear from the heart then the devotee is established in goodness and he becomes completely happy thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness the man whose mind has been enlivened by contact with devotional service to the lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the personality of godhead in the stage of liberation from all material association thus the knot in the heart is pierced and all misgivings are cut to pieces the chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the self as master
10 he will become liberated from the influence of the modes of ignorance and passion and thus all inauspicious things accumulated in the core of the heart will disappear
11 how will i make them understand this message of krishna consciousness i am very unfortunate unqualified and the most fallen therefore i am seeking your benediction so that i can convince them for i am powerless to do so on my own
12 somehow or other o lord you have brought me here to speak about you now my lord it is up to you to make me a success or failure as you like
13 o spiritual master of all the worlds i can simply repeat your message so if you like you can make my power of speaking suitable for their understanding
14 only by your causeless mercy will my words become pure i am sure that when this transcendental message penetrates their hearts they will certainly feel engladdened and thus become liberated from all unhappy conditions of life
15 o lord i am just like a puppet in your hands so if you have brought me here to dance then make me dance make me dance o lord make me dance as you like
16 i have no devotion nor do i have any knowledge but i have strong faith in the holy name of krsna i have been designated as bhaktivedanta and now if you like you can fulfill the real purport of bhaktivedanta

refrain o brothers o brother the supreme lord krsna will bestow virtue upon you  but he will do this only when srimati radharani first becomes pleased with you this i surely declare to you
1 sri srimad bhaktisiddhanta sarasvati thakura who is very dear to lord gauranga the son of mother saci is unparalleled in his service to the supreme lord sri krsna he is that great saintly spiritual master most magnanimous within this universe who bestows devotion to krsna in various places throughout the world
2 his desire is very powerful and thus he is causing the holy name of lord gauranga to spread throughout all the countries of the western world in all the cities towns and villages on the earth extending to all the oceans rivers and streams everyone may accept the holy name of krsna
3 thus all directions will be conquered by a flood of transcendental ecstasy flowing with the excessive mercy of sri caitanya mahaprabhu when all the miserable living entities that have been corrupted by maya become happy then the vaisnavas desire is fulfilled
4 although my guru maharaja ordered me to accomplish this mission i am unworthy to do it being very fallen and incompetent that being the case o lord krsna your mercy is today arising in a befitting manner to make me become worthy for you are the wisest of all
5 if you bestow your divine power then one attains the factual substance which is service to the spiritual master  and life becomes successful if that service is obtained then one becomes truly satisfied and ultimately receives your association due to good fortune
6 as stated by prahlada maharaja to lord nrsimhadeva in the srimad bhagavatam 7928
thus by associating with material desires one after another i was following the general populace by falling into a blind well full of snakes my dear lord o supreme personality of godhead then the great sage narada muni kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve the transcendental position similar to his own how could i ever leave the service of your servant
7 o lord krsna you are my eternal companion forgetting you i have suffered the kicking of maya birth after birth if today the chance to meet you occurs again then surely i will be able to rejoin you
8 o my dear brother in your company i will experience great joy once again wandering about the pastures and fields i will pass the entire day with you in tending the cows joking with you and frolicking throughout so many forests of vraja i will roll upon the ground in spiritual ecstasy when oh when will that day be mine
9 today that remembrance of being with you came to me in a very nice way feeling great longing i called out for you o lord krsna only because i am your eternal servant do i desire your association so much except for you i have no other refuge

3 o my mind searching for some sweet aroma you smell the beautiful palasa flower but it has no scent and instead an insect from the flower enters your nose you suck on dry wood mistaking it for sugar cane so how can you get any sweet juice
4 o my mind death is like snake which you put around your neck thinking it to be a garland you entered fire thinking it to be cool and suffered excruciating burning
5 o my mind enjoying material pleasures you never heeded the devotees words and forgot gaurasundara thus both this world and the next are lost to you

translation
1 my lord nityananda the jewel of all virtues my lord nityananda the jewel of all virtues has brought the flood of ecstatic love of god that has drowned the entire world
2 bringing this overwhelming deluge of prema when he returned to bengal from jagannatha puri on lord caitanyas order nitai has inundated the assembly of devotees the fallen nondevotees did not drown however but remained floating on that ecstatic ocean
3 lord nityananda freely offered this exalted prema which is difficult for lord brahma to attain even to the fallen and wretched souls who did not desire it
4 the ocean of mercy had formerly been sealed tight but nitai cut a channel in its boundary to allow the great flooding waves of nectarean prema to splash from house to house
5 locana dasa says whoever has not worshiped my nitai or taken advantage of this excellent opportunity offered by him knowingly commits suicide

translation
1 the two lords nitaigauracandra are very merciful they are the essence of all incarnations the specific significance of these incarnations is that they introduced a process of chanting and dancing that is simply joyful
2 my dear brother i request that you just worship lord caitanya and nityananda with firm conviction and faith if one wants to be krsna conscious by this process one has to give up his engagement in sense gratification one simply has to chant hare krsna hari hari without any motive
3 my dear brother just try and examine this within the three worlds there is no one like lord caitanya or lord nityananda their merciful qualities are so great that upon hearing them even birds and beasts cry and stones melt
4 but locana dasa regrets that i am entrapped by sense gratification since i have no attraction for the lotus feet of lord caitanya and lord nityananda then yamaraja the superintendent of death is punishing me by not allowing me to be attracted by this movement

1 o wicked mind what kind of vaisnava do you think you are your pretentious show of chanting lord haris holy name in a solitary place is only for the sake of attaining the false prestige of a worldly reputation  it is nothing but pure hypocrisy
2 such materialistic prestige is as disgusting as the stool of a hog do you not know that it is only a mere illusion cast by the potency of maya what is the value of contemplating day and night your plans for enjoying wealth and women all these things are only temporary
3 when you claim wealth as your own it creates in you everincreasing desires for material enjoyment your riches should be used for serving madhava the lord of all wealth neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust for women whose only true proprietor is lord yadava
4 the demon ravana lustincarnate fought with lord ramachandra loveincarnate in order to gain the tree of worldly reputation  but that oasis turned out to be but a mirage cast in the desert wasteland of the lords illusory material potency please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and solid platform whereupon a vaisnava ever stands if you neglect worshiping the lord from this position then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence
5 why do you needlessly suffer the torment of blaspheming the devotees of lord hari attempting to achieve their eminence thereby only proving your own fruitless foolishness the desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one becomes a devotee of the lord for eternal fame automatically follows the heels of a vaisnava and that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly opulence
6 the relationship between a devotee and lord hari is devoid of even a trace of worldly illusion it has nothing to do with the materialistic cheating propensity the prestige of socalled popularity in the material realm is compared to a treacherous dogeating witch and the attempt to live in solitude to supposedly engage in unalloyed bhajan is compared to an entangling network of distraction please know that anyone striving in either of these ways verily lives in the hell of mayas illusion
7 i shall give up chanting the lords name publicly in kirtan and retire to solitude thus smearing myself with worldly honor dear mind what is the good of seeking such socalled glory i will always remind you that the great soul madhavendra puri never deceived himself in that regard by committing theft in his own storehouse of perception the way you do
8 your cheap reputation is equal to the stool of a hog an ordinary ambitious man like you can never be equated with a devotee of madhavendra puris eminence under the sway of envy you have drowned yourself in the filthy waters of material enjoyment after having abandoned the excellent perfection of congregational kirtan
9 truly o wicked mind the glories of socalled solitary worship are propagated only by false yogis using unscrupulous means to deceive others to save yourself from these pitfalls please contemplate the instructions that the supreme lord sri chaitanya mahaprabhu kindly gave us while addressing srila sanatana goswami with the utmost care
10 do not forget for a moment the two most valuable concepts that he taught 1 the principle of dry apparent renunciation as opposed to real appropriate renunciation and 2 the principle of a soul being trapped in the bondage of matter as opposed to a soul who is liberated dont ever make the mistake of thinking that these conflicting concepts are on the same level please remember this while engaging yourself in chanting the lords holy names as loud as you possibly can
11 one is truly a vaisnava who has given up the habit of falling victim to the ferocious tigress of wealth beauty and fame such a soul is factually detached from material life and is known as a pure devotee someone with this consciousness of detachment has thereby become victorious over the mundane world of birth and death
12 one is indeed detached who moderately partakes of worldly things that are deemed necessary for living in devotional service a devotee acting in that manner does not fall prey to the disease of material infatuation thus devoid of selfish attachment and endowed with the ability to see things in relation to the lord all sense objects are then directly perceived as being lord madhava himself
13 this is the standard of befitting renunciation and one who realizes this is most fortunate indeed everything involved in such a devotees life represents lord haris personal spiritual opulence as manifest in the world of matter on the other hand one who engages in chanting the lords name with hopes of enhancing his own material reputation finds that all his activities and paraphernalia represent only the riches of hypocrisy
14 o mind please reject the company of two types of persons  those desiring impersonal liberation from the material world and those who desire to enjoy the pleasure of material sense objects both of these are equally nondevotees the things that are used in relation to lord krsna are objects belonging directly to the transcendental realm and thus having nothing to do with matter they cannot be either owned or forsaken by persons interested in mundane enjoyment or renunciation
15 an impersonal philospher is opposed to thinking of krsna as an object of devotion and thus being puffed up with the false pride of imaginary liberation he dares to criticize the true devotees of the lord o mind you are the servant of the vaisnavas and you should always hope for attaining devotion why then do you make such a loud commotion by calling to me and trying to prove the supposed supremacy of your practice of solitary worship
16 one who falsely gives up things that could actually be used in the lords service proudly calls himself a renunciate but unfortunately he can never become a vaisnava by such an attitude abandoning his servitorship to the lotus feet of lord hari and resigning himself to his solitary home  whatever is gained by that exercise can only be the worthless treasure of deception
17 ever engage yourself in the service of sri radha and keep aloof from the vicious snake of materialistic sense gratification the glory of participating in the lords kirtan is not meant to bolster anyones ambitions for personal recognition o mind why then have you abandoned the identity of being radhas eternal servant in favor of retiring to a solitary place to practice the cheating process of socalled bhajan
18 the most valuable treasures amongst the lords preachers are the eternal personalities residing in vrajadham they never occupy themselves with begging for worthless material reputation which is cherished only by the living dead the vrajavasis are truly infused with life and therefore they preach in order to give life to the walking corpses of the mundane world all the songs that the vrajavasis sing about the glories of lord krsna are devoid of any tinge of desire for fame
19 srila bhaktisiddhanta saraswati servant of radha and her beloved krsna always hopes for kirtan and he begs all to loudly sing the names of lord hari the transcendental power of congregational chanting automatically awakens remembrance of the lord and his divine pastimes in relation to ones own eternal spiritual form only at that time does it become possible to go off to a solitary place and engage in the confidential worship of their lordships

1 in the beginning of creation the science of devotional service was received by the fourheaded brahma from the supreme lord sri krsna devarsi naradas understanding of this divine science was obtained from brahma the great sage krsna dvaipayana vyasa who was empowered to compile the vedic literatures became a disciple of devarsi narada sripada madhvacarya the founder of the suddhadvaita school of vedanta philosophy who visited vyasadeva at badarikasrama in the thirteenth century to learn from him vedanta philosophy calls himself a servant of krsna dvaipayana vyasa purnaprajna tirtha madhva is the guru and sole refuge of padmanabha tirtha
2 the two other principal disciples of madhva are nrhari tirtha and madhava tirtha madhava tirtha accepted the great paramhamsa aksobhya tirtha as a disciple the principal disciple of aksobhya tirtha was known as jayatirtha jayatirthas service was for his disciple jnanasindhu
3 dayanidhi received the science of devotional service from jnanasindhu and the servant of dayanidhi was vidyanidhi vidyadhiraja tirtha rajendra tirtha became a disciple of vidyadhiraja tirtha rajendra tirthas servant was known as jayadharma or vijayadhvaja tirtha in this way you should properly understand this disciplic succession
4 the great sannyasi sri purusottama tirtha received his knowledge in the service of his guru vijayadhvaja tirtha jayadharma the principal disciple of purusottama tirtha was subrahmanya tirtha his servant was the great vyasatirtha vyasa raya vyasatirthas servant was laksmipati tirtha whose disciple was madhavendra puri gosvami
5 the chief disciple of madhavendra puri was isvara puri and two of his other disciples were the renowned incarnations of godhead sri nityananda and advaita acarya sri caitanya mahaprabhu the spiritual preceptor of all the worlds made isvari puri greatly fortunate by accepting him as his spiritual master
6 mahaprabhu sri caitanya is non different from sri sri radha and krsna and is the very life of those vaisnavas who follow sri rupa gosvami sri svarupa damodara gosvami rupa gosvami and sanatana gosvami were the givers of great happiness to visvambhara sri caitanya
7 the great souls jiva gosvami and raghunatha dasa gosvami became very dear to rupa gosvami jiva gosvami was a disciple of rupa gosvami and raghunatha dasa gosvami a disciple of advaita acaryas disciple yadunandana acarya was accepted by rupa and sanatana as their third brother raghunatha dasa gosvamis beloved student was krsnadasa kaviraja gosvami krsnadasa kaviraja was an intimate friend of lokanatha gosvami they lived together in vrndavana and always discussed the topics of krsna with one another lokanatha gosvami a disciple of gadadhara pandita had only one disciple whose name was narottama dasa narottama dasa was always engaged in the service of his guru and he also engaged himself in the service of his gurus intimate friend thus he became very dear to krsnadasa kaviraja gosvami to serve i the feet of narottama dasa thakura was the only desire of visvanatha cakravarti thakura who was the fourth acarya in disciplic succession from narottama dasa
8 visvanatha cakravarti thakura was the siksaguru instructing spiritual master of baladeva vidyabhusana to whom he taught the precepts of srimadbhagavatam jagannatha dasa babaji was a very prominent acarya after sri baladeva vidyabhusana and was the beloved siksaguru of sri bhaktivinoda thakura bhaktivinoda thakuras intimate friend and associate was the eminent mahabhagavata sri gaurakisora dasa babaji whose sole joy was found in haribhajana
9 these treat saintly vaisnavas are all paramahamsas or devotees of the highest order and they are all part of lord gaurangas own spiritual family their holy feet are my refuge i have no real interest in devotional service and i am a poor and lowly tridandi sannyai named sri bhaktisiddhanta sarasvati

1 to the supreme lord whose form is the embodiment of eternal existence knowledge and bliss whose sharkshaped earrings are swinging to and fro who is beautifully shining in the divine realm of gokula who i due to the offense of breaking the pot of yogurt that his mother was churning into butter and then stealing the butter that was kept hanging from a swing is quickly running from the wooden grinding mortar in fear of mother yasoda but who has been caught from behind by her who ran after him with greater speedto that supreme lord sri damodara i offer my humble obeisances
2 seeing the whipping stick in his mothers hand he is crying and rubbing his eyes again and again with his two lotus hands his eyes are filled with fear and the necklace of pearls around his neck which is marked with three lines like a conch shell is shaking because of his quick breathing due to crying to this supreme lord sri damodara whose belly is bound not with ropes but with his mothers pure love i offer my humble obeisances
3 by such childhood pastimes as this he is drowning the inhabitants of gokula in pools of ecstasy and is revealing to those devotees who are absorbed in knowledge of his supreme majesty and opulence that he is only conquered by devotees whose pure love is imbued with intimacy and is free from all conceptions of awe and reverence with great love i again offer my obeisances to lord damodara hundreds and hundreds of times
4 o lord although you are able to give all kinds of benedictions i do not pray to you for the boon of impersonal liberation nor the highest liberation of eternal life in vaikuntha nor any other boon which may be obtained by executing the nine processes of bhakti o lord i simply wish that this form of yours as bala gopala in vrndavana may ever be manifest in my heart for what is the use to me of any other boon besides this
5 o lord your lotus face which is encircled by locks of soft black hair tinged with red is kissed again and again by mother yasoda and your lips are reddish like the bimba fruit may this beautiful vision of your lotus face be ever manifest in my heart thousands and thousands of other benedictions are of no use to me
6 o supreme godhead i offer my obeisances unto you o damodara o ananta o vishnu o master o my lord be pleased upon me by showering your glance of mercy upon me deliver this poor ignorant fool who is immersed in an ocean of worldly sorrows and become visible to my eyes
7 o lord damodara just as the two sons of kuveramanigriva and nalakuvarawere delivered from the curse of narada and made into great devotees by you in your form as a baby tied with rope to a wooden grinding mortar in the same way please give to me your own premabhakti i only long for this and have no desire for any kind of liberation
8 o lord damodara i first of all offer my obeisances to the brilliantly effulgent rope which binds your belly i then offer my obeisances to your belly which is the abode of the entire universe i humbly bow down to your most beloved srimati radharani and i offer all obeisances to you the supreme lord who displays unlimited pastimes

1 the gopis said o beloved your birth in the land of vraja has made it exceedingly glorious and thus indira the goddess of fortune always resides here it is only for your sake that we your devoted servants maintain our lives we have been searching everywhere for you so please show yourself to us
2 o lord of love in beauty your glance excels the whorl of the finest most perfectly formed lotus within the autumn pond o bestower of benedictions you are killing the maidservants who have given themselves to you freely without any price isnt this murder
3 o greatest of personalities you have repeatedly saved us from all kinds of danger  from poisoned water from the terrible maneater agha from the great rains from the wind demon from the fiery thunderbolt of indra from the bull demon and from the son of maya danava
4 you are not actually the son of the gopi yasoda o friend but rather the indwelling witness in the hearts of all embodied souls because lord brahma prayed for you to come and protect the universe you have now appeared in the satvata dynasty
5 o best of the vrsnis your lotuslike hand which holds the hand of the goddess of fortune grants fearlessness to those who approach your feet out of fear of material existence o lover please place that wishfulfilling lotus hand on our heads
6 o you who destroy the suffering of vrajas people o hero of all women your smile shatters the false pride of your devotees please dear friend accept us as your maidservants and show us your beautiful lotus face
7 your lotus feet destroy the past sins of all embodied souls who surrender to them those feet follow after the cows in the pastures and are the eternal abode of the goddess of fortune since you once put those feet on the hoods of the great serpent kaliya please place them upon our breasts and tear away the lust in our hearts
8 o lotuseyed one your sweet voice and charming words which attract the minds of the intelligent are bewildering us more and more our dear hero please revive your maidservants with the nectar of your lips
9 the nectar of your words and the descriptions of your activities are the life and soul of those suffering in this material world these narrations transmitted by learned sages eradicate ones sinful reactions and bestow good fortune upon whoever hears them these narrations are broadcast all over the world and are filled with spiritual power certainly those who spread the message of godhead are most munificent
10 your smiles your sweet loving glances the intimate pastimes and confidential talks we enjoyed with you  all these are auspicious to meditate upon and they touch our hearts but at the same time o deceiver they very much agitate our minds
11 dear master dear lover when you leave the cowherd village to herd the cows our minds are disturbed with the thought that your feet more beautiful than a lotus will be pricked by the spiked husks of grain and the rough grass and plants
12 at the end of the day you repeatedly show us your lotus face covered with dark blue locks of hair and thickly powdered with dust thus o hero you arouse lusty desires in our minds
13 your lotus feet which are worshiped by lord brahma fulfill the desires of all who bow down to them they are the ornament of the earth they give the highest satisfaction and in times of danger they are the appropriate object of meditation o lover o destroyer of anxiety please put those lotus feet upon our breasts
14 o hero kindly distribute to us the nectar of your lips which enhances conjugal pleasure and vanquishes grief that nectar is thoroughly relished by your vibrating flute and makes people forget any other attachment
15 when you go off to the forest during the day a tiny fraction of a second becomes like a millennium for us because we cannot see you and even when we can eagerly look upon your beautiful face so lovely with its adornment of curly locks our pleasure is hindered by our eyelids which were fashioned by the foolish creator
16 dear acyuta you know very well why we have come here who but a cheater like you would abandon young women who come to see him in the middle of the night enchanted by the loud song of his flute just to see you we have completely rejected our husbands children ancestors brothers and other relatives
17 our minds are repeatedly bewildered as we think of the intimate conversations we had with you in secret feel the rise of lust in our hearts and remember your smiling face your loving glances and your broad chest the resting place of the goddess of fortune thus we experience the most severe hankering for you
18 o beloved your allauspicious appearance vanquishes the distress of those living in vrajas forests our minds long for your association please give to us just a bit of that medicine which counteracts the disease in your devotees hearts
19 o dearly beloved your lotus feet are so soft that we place them gently on our breasts fearing that your feet will be hurt our life rests only in you our minds therefore are filled with anxiety that your tender feet might be wounded by pebbles as you roam about on the forest path

3 here the gopis glorified the earth saying o earth what austerities have you done so that your surface is now marked with krishnas footprints may i reside in vrndavana
4 may i reside in vrndavana where because the vedas say raso vai sah the supreme personality of godhead is sweetness transcendental sweetness attained its highest perfection in the gopis passionate love
5 although only five yojanas in circumference bounded by bhandiravana govardhana hill and the rasadance arena it is unlimited in transcendental opulence may i reside in vrndavana
6 because vrsabhanus daughter is the queen and because here the happiness of pure love of god rises i yearn to live here i pray may i reside in vrndavana
7 even by performing many austerities goddess lakshmi could not enter the great rasadance pastime here may i reside in the splendidly beautiful groves of vrndavana

2 he wears sharkshaped earrings that dance very expertly upon his cheeks the beauty of the orb of his face destroys the pride of the multitude of moons and lotus flowers he causes the knot of his own secret ecstatic lovemoods to increasingly tighten amongst the gopis may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
3 he is eternally engaged in designing everfresh variations of his youthful form mode of dress and loving pastimes he is surrounded by the assembly of his cowherd boyfriends who excel in giving him delight by their playful joking words even a single brilliant ray of splendor from his personal pleasureforest defeats the heavenly nandana gardens of lord indra may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
4 he is delighted by the friendship of his devotees whose consciousness is decorated with golden ornaments of pure love for him he is praised by great demigods who protect various planets in the universe and who offer obeisances to him by touching their foreheads to the ground he honors the brahmanas with great reverence at specific times of the day may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
5 he easily removed the pride of indra as well as the violent anger of kaliya and he killed the demons like kamsa and vatasura with the rainfall of these variegated pastimes he nourishes the chataka birds who are his devotees by performing his pastimes of heroic nature he delights the residents of his own cowherd community may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
6 he satisfies sri radhika and the other gopis with the nectar of the sportive rasa dance performed in the groves of vrndavana during the various intrigues of those amorous pastimes he devises many playful jokes to sustain the assmebly of gopis he thus delights the minds of all people in the universe by the glory of his loving pastimes may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
7 by revealing his pastimes of festive rasa dance he also shows the eternal path of his pure devotional service by his amazing beauty and fascinating mode of dress he churns the minds of a vast multitude of cupids through the outer corners of his eyes he casts sidelong glances aimed at the gopis that give hints of a host of affectionate ecstatic moods may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
8 he becomes excited with desire by suddenly touching sri radhika while she is busy picking flowers then he becomes jubilant when he sees her charming face decorated with the contrariness of pure love verily he is the sandlewood paste that decorates radhikas breasts may sri krsna the son of the king of the cowherd men grant me the service of his own lotus feet
9 it is very difficult for laksmi devi and other exalted gods and goddesses to attain even a glimpse of sri krsna who is very dear to sri radhika but if someone glorifies him by reciting these eight verses with full attention then he who is delighted by the intimate of association with radhikas limbs will become pleased with that person and engage them in the service of his own lotus feet within the cowherd forests of goloka vrndavana

1 her splendorous golden complexion steals the pride of a golden lotus flower anointed with a tinge of red kunkum her sweet fragrance mocks the fame of the aroma of a lotus flower sprinkled with saffron powder she is fully qualified to fulfill all the desires of the son of the king of the cowherd men may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
2 her amazing and colorful silken garments make the splendor of red coral feel ashamed she is a garden of blossoming flowers where the maddened bumblebee named krsna performs amorous pastimes she worships the sungod daily in order to attain the continual association of her beloved krsna may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
3 her charming youthful delicacy negates the fame of the freshlysprouted leaves her refreshing form is worthy of being served by the cooling moon sandalwood paste lotus flowers and camphor when she touches the master of the gopis she dispels the burning heat of his lusty desires may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
4 although the goddess of fortune laksmi devi is adored by other youthful goddesses who are themselves glorified throughout the universe still she is nowhere near sri radhika in the matter of beauty praiseworthy youthfulness or other divine feminine opulences there is no one in the material or the spiritual worlds superior to radhika in the expression of naturally loving pastimes may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
5 she is very learned in many transcendental arts such as performing in the rasa dance singing and joking she is decorated with many divine qualities such as loving nature exquisite beauty and wonderful garments and ornaments even among the cowherd damsels of vraja who are praised by the entire universe she is the best in every way may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
6 she possesses the opulences of eternal youthful beauty eternal pastimes and eternal love for krsna her ecstatic feelings of love for krsna cause the gopis who are also in love with krsna to tremble she is always attached to meditating on sri krsnas beautiful form ornaments garments and pastimes may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
7 she is graced with eight ecstatic symptoms sattvikabhava such as trembling perspiring standing up on bodily hairs tears faltering of the voice and so forth she is adorned with different ecstatic emotional ornaments such as impatience joy contrariness and so forth she is decorated with beautiful jewels that give total delight to the eyes of krsna may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
8 if she is apart from krsna for even half a moment she becomes stricken with wretched suffering restlessness and a multitude of other ecstatic symptoms of separation when she regains the association of krsna after some effort then all of her anguish immediately vanishes may sri radhika bestow upon me the service of her own lotus feet
9 it is very difficult for parvati and other exalted goddesses to attain even a glimpse of srimati radharani who is dear to lord krsna but if someone glorifies her by reciting these eight verses then she who is delighted by krsnas continuous association will grant the sweet nectar of her personal service to that person who thereby enters the assembly of her similarly delighted girlfriends

translation
1 on ekadasi day mahaprabhu who is the life and soul of all beings decreed that everyone should gather for kirtana hearing the sound of his own name he began to dance in ecstasy
2 in srivasaangana srivasa thakuras divine courtyard he inaugurated the auspicious reverberations of the kirtana in a booming voice gopala govinda
3 in the courtyard the sounds of the mrdanga small cymbals conch karatalas and beautiful singing all mixed together
4 the loud sound passed through the entire brahmanda and filled the whole sky reaching svetadvipa destroying everything inauspicious in all the fourteen worlds
5 from morning visvambhara he who nourishes and maintains the whole universe by bhakti started dancing many groups sang charmingly  each group singing a different melody
6 srivasa pandita was the guru of one group of kirtaniyas and mukunda was the lead singer of another
7 govinda ghosa was the head of another group gauracandra danced in the middle of the whole kirtana party
8 the mighty nityananda prabhu protected mahaprabhu when he swooned while dancing as advaita acarya secretly took his footdust at that time
9 tears came to gadadhara mukunda sridhara and others upon hearing mahaprabhus kirtana as the rising of astasattvika bhavas overwhelmed their hearts
10 visvambhara danced with so much force that the earth trembled causing all the devotees to become afraid
11 sometimes visvambhara danced so gracefully and sweetly that he appeared to be natavara nandanandana the best of dancers
12 mahaprabhus beauty is unequalled and unsurpassed defeating even krsnas beauty even krsna has no mahabhava all his followers eyes filled with ananda seeing his dancing
13 mahaprabhu visvambhara danced absorbed in ananda hearing the rhythm of his dancing feet the devotees became spellbound
14 as mahaprabhu danced being filled with bhava his garland could not stay around his neck but broke all the flowers falling at the feet of his devotees
15 the auspicious sounds of sri harinamasankirtana spread in every direction while jagannatha misras son danced in the midst of all the devotees
16 siva chants the same blissful name and becomes so absorbed in prema that his cloth falls down hearing mahaprabhus glories siva starts to dance and mahaprabhu hearing his own glories also dances
17 by this same nama valmiki achieved the wealth of austerity  he saw all rama lila and by this same nama all of ajamilas anarthas and aparadhas were pulled out by the root
18 hearing sri krsnanama totally cuts all worldly attachments sri krsna himself came in kaliyuga as mahaprabhu dancing and advising all to chant krsnanama
19 sukadeva and narada also chant this krsnanama and distribute it with thousands of tongues mahaprabhu sings the glories of this nama
20 taking mahaprabhus name constitutes the highest form of atonement seeing mahaprabhu dancing the devotees became supremely fortunate
21 seeing mahaprabhus bliss the devotees embraced each other and wept loudly as the rays of mahaprabhus ananda entered their hearts
22 all the devotees attended kirtana and mahaprabhu personally decorated their bodies with candana and garlands sri gaurasundara and the devotees sang and tasted krsnarasa with great joy
23 absorbed in kirtana all the vaisnava devotees completely lost sense of their own bodies and everyone else around them
24 jaya krsna murari mukunda vanamali day and night all the devotees sang kirtana in great happiness
25 visvambhara danced twentyfour hours with his devotees but never tired because his body was sattvakalevara fully transcendental
26 daily mahaprabhu in full prema danced in kirtana the whole night and only stopped three hours before sunrise
27 daily mahaprabhu the hero who enjoys the premarasa of vaikuntha svetadvipa tasted and distributed great bliss in navadvipa
28 gauracandra and all his associates enter in the hearts of the devotees who hear the allvirtuous harikatha with full faith thus their hearts become srivasaangana
29 vrndavana dasa says sri krsna caitanya and the moonlike nityananda prabhu are my life and soul and i offer my dandavatpranama at their lotus feet

1 o mind i grasp your feet and beg you with sweet words please cast away all hypocrisy and develop intense unprecedented love for my spiritual master vrajabhumi the people of vraja the vaisnavas the brahmanas the gayatri mantra the holy name and the transcendental shelter that is the fresh young couple of vraja radha and krsna
2 o mind dont concern yourself with the pious and impious deeds described in the vedas rather intently serve sri sri radhakrsna in vraja always remember that lord caitanya is the son of maharaja nanda and that my guru is most dear to lord mukunda
3 o mind just listen to me if you desire to reside in vraja birth after birth and if you desire to directly serve the divine youthful couple there with great attraction then with intense love always remember and bow down to srila svarupa damodara gosvami to srila rupa gosvami and his elder brother srila sanatana gosvami and to all their associates and followers
4 o mind give up friendship with nondevotees which is nothing but a prostitute who will steal the treasure of your heartyour desire to serve radhakrsna dont listen to talks of impersonal liberation which are a tigress who devours everyone you should even give up attraction for lord narayana which leads to the world of vaikuntha instead o mind just worship sri sri radhakrsna in vraja for they bestow upon their worshipers the jewel of pure love for themselves
5 the highwaymen of lust and his friends have bound me around the neck with the painful horrible powerful ropes of many wicked deeds o mind please scream out to the devotees of krsna the killer of baka i am being killed then he will save me
6 o mind why do you burn us both by bathing in the urine trickling from the ass of great deviousness and hypocrisy instead you should delight us by eternally bathing in the glistening nectarocean of pure love for sri sri gandharvagiridhari sri sri radhakrsna
7 as long as the impudent untouchable woman of the desire for fame dances in my heart why should pure love for radhakrsna touch me o mind continuously serve my spiritual master the leader of those who are dear to the lord then my master will quickly kick out that harridan and allow that pure love to enter
8 so that he will mercifully smash my wickedness even though i am a great rascal so that he will give me the splendid nectar of transcendental love and so he will engage me in sri radhas service please o mind with words choked with emotion worship lord giridhari here in vraja
9 o mind please meditate on krsna the moon of vraja forest as the lord of my controller srimati radharani and please meditate upon srimati radharani the queen of vraja forest as krsnas controller also please meditate upon lalita as the peerless friend of radha and krsna visakha as the guru who teaches them many things and radhakunda and govardhana hill as two places the mere sight of which bestows charming transcendental love for the divine couple
10 o mind please worship lord haris beloved radha with the splendor of her beauty she makes rati gauri and lila burn with envy with the power of her good fortune she defeats saci laksmi and satyabhama and with her ability to control krsna she completely eclipses candravali and the other pious young girls of vraja
11 o mind in order to attain the direct service of the two divine lovers sri sri radhagiridhari in the company of their friends every day you must constantly drink with sri rupa gosvami the five nectars of worshiping them chanting their names meditating on them hearing about them and bowing down before them and every day you must worship govardhana hill
12 these eleven excellent instructions to the mind grant all spiritual benedictions a person who stays with the devotees follows srila rupa gosvami and with a sweet voice loudly sings these eleven verses will attain the matchless jewel of direct service to sri sri radhakrsna in the forest of gokula

1 sometimes in great happiness lord jagannatha makes a loud concert with his flute in the groves on the banks of the yamuna he is like a bumblebee tasting the beautiful lotus like faces of the cowherd damsels of vraja and great personalities such as laksmi siva brahma indra and ganesa worship his lotus feet may that jagannatha svami be the object of my vision
2 in his left hand lord jagannatha holds a flute on his head he wears peacock feathers and on his hips he wears fine yellow silken cloth from the corners of his eyes he bestows sidelong glances upon his loving devotees and he always reveals himself through his pastimes in his divine abode of vrndavana may that jagannatha svami be the object of my vision
3 on the shore of the great ocean within a large palace atop the brilliant golden nilacala hill lord jagannatha resides with his powerful brother balabhadra and his sister subhadra who sits between them may that jagannatha svami who bestows the opportunity for devotional service upon all godly souls be the object of my vision
4 lord jagannatha is an ocean of mercy and as beautiful as a row of blackish rain clouds he is the storehouse of bliss for laksmi and sarasvati and his face resembles a spotless fullblown lotus the best of demigods and sages worship him and the upanisads sing his glories may that jagannatha svami be the object of my vision
5 when lord jagannatha moves along the road on his rathayatra car at every step large assemblies of brahmanas loudly chant prayers and sing songs for his pleasure hearing their hymns lord jagannatha becomes very favorably disposed toward them he is the ocean of mercy and the true friend of all the worlds may that jagannatha svami along with his consort laksmi who was born from the ocean of nectar be the object of my vision
6 lord jagannatha whose eyes resemble fullblown lotus petals is the ornament on lord brahmas head he resides on nilacala hill with his lotus feet placed on the heads of anantadeva overwhelmed by the mellows of love he joyfully embraces srimati radharanis body which is like a cool pond may that jagannatha svami be the object of my vision
7 i do not pray for a kingdom nor do i pray for gold rubies or wealth i do not ask for a beautiful wife as desired by all men i simply pray that jagannatha svami whose glories lord siva always sings may be the constant object of my vision
8 o lord of the demigods please quickly remove this useless material existence i am undergoing o lord of the yadus please destroy this vast shoreless ocean of sins alas this is certain lord jagannatha bestows his lotus feet upon those who feel themselves fallen and have no shelter in this world but him may that jagannatha svami be the object of my vision
9 the selfretrained virtuous soul who recites these eight verses glorifying lord jagannatha becomes cleansed of all sins and duly proceeds to lord visnus abode

eso he syamala nayanabhiram
3
emni kore ar koto kal
kandale amai giridharilal
ei jivane hai jadi nahi pai
maraner upare sarana nilam
eso he syamala nayanabhiram
translation
refrain o beautiful one o youthful boy who lives in my heart please come to me o dark syamal o delighter of my eyes
1 the desire of my heart is to worship you intimately in this hope i humbly bow unto your lotus feet
2 o love of my eyes please take me with you while i am suffering in your separation the melody of our impending meeting is the only thing that gives me any happiness o monarch of my life why do you remain silent and never speak to me tears are flowing from my eyes and nothing in this world gives me any satisfaction
3 how much longer must i continue living in this condition you are making me weep and cry out for you o darling giridhari lal if i cannot attain you in this lifetime then i shall just give up and surrender myself unto death
song name tatala saikate
official name kahe visaya mana
author srila vidyapati
1
tatala saikate bari bindu sama
suta mita ramani samaye
tohe visari mana tahe samarpala
ab majhu habo kon kaje
2
madhava hama parinam nirasa
tuhun jaga tarana dina doya moy
ataye tohari visoyasa
3
adha janama hama ninde goyayalun
jara sisu koto dina gela
nidhuvane ramani rasa range matala
tohe bhajabo kon bela
4
koto caturanana mari mari jaota
na tuya adi avasana
tohe janami puna tohe samaota
sagara lahari samana
5
bhanaye vidyapati sesa samana bhoy
tuya vina gati nahi ara
adi anadika natha kahayasi
bhava tarana bhara tohara
translation
1 o lord completely forgetting you i have offered my mind unto the society of women children and friendsbut this experience has been just like offering a drop of water unto the burning hot sands of the beach how can i possibly be relieved of this great misery
2 o madhava as a consequence i am rendered totally despondent you are the savior of the universe and are merciful to the helpless souls therefore i place my hope only in you
3 wandering about in a halfalive condition i spent my life in utter disgrace uncountable days passed as a frivolous child and a useless old man i have been intoxicated by the pleasure of sharing romantic adventures with beautiful young women when will i ever get a chance to worship you
4 numberless brahmas have died one after another whereas you are without beginning or end all of them take birth from you and are again absorbed in you just like the waves in the ocean
5 vidyapati confesses than now at the end of his life he is fearful of death o lord there is no shelter other than you you will always remain celebrated as being the lord of both beginning and the beginningless now the responsibility for my deliverance from the material world is entirely yours
