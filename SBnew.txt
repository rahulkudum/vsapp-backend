oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya

tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ
tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ yathā vinimayo yatra tri-sargo 'mṛṣā
dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi
om—O my Lord; namaḥ—offering my obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Personality of Godhead; vāsudevāya—unto Vāsudeva (the son of Vasudeva), or Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the primeval Lord; janma-ādi—creation, sustenance and destruction; asya—of the manifested universes; yataḥ—from whom; anvayāt—directly; itarataḥ—indirectly; ca—and; artheṣu—purposes; abhijṣaḥ—fully cognizant; sva-rāṭ—fully independent; tene—imparted; brahma—the Vedic knowledge; hṛdā—consciousness of the heart; yaḥ—one who; ādi-kavaye—unto the original created being; muhyanti—are illusioned; yat—about whom; sūrayaḥ—great sages and demigods; tejaḥ—fire; vāri—water; mṛdām—earth; yathā—as much as; vinimayaḥ—action and reaction; yatra—whereupon; tri-sargaḥ—three modes of creation, creative faculties; amṛṣā—almost factual; dhāmnā—along with all transcendental paraphernalia; svena—self-sufficiently; sadā—always; nirasta—negation by absence; kuhakam—illusion; satyam—truth; param—absolute; dhīmahi—I do meditate upon.
O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.

dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ
vedyaṁ vāstavam atra vastu śivadaṁ tāpa-trayonmūlanam

Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bhāgavata Purāṇa propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhāgavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyāsadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of the Bhāgavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.

Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.

Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.

Others, who are pacified by means of transcendental self-realization and have conquered over the modes of nature by dint of strong power and knowledge, also enter into You, but for them there is much pain, whereas the devotee simply discharges devotional service and thus feels no such pain.

O original person, we are therefore but Yours only. Although we are Your creatures, we are born one after another under the influence of the three modes of nature, and for this reason we are separated in action. Therefore, after the creation we could not act concertedly for Your transcendental pleasure.

Lord Brahmā said: O my Lord, today, after many, many years of penance, I have come to know about You. Oh, how unfortunate the embodied living entities are that they are unable to know Your personality! My Lord, You are the only knowable object because there is nothing supreme beyond You. If there is anything supposedly superior to You, it is not the Absolute. You exist as the Supreme by exhibiting the creative energy of matter.

Since You have manifested this eternal personal form upon whom Your devotees meditate, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Those who are destined to be dispatched to the path of hell neglect Your personal form because of speculating on material topics.

They always try to protect their wealth, body and friends, they are filled with lamentation and unlawful desires concerning their paraphernalia, and they avariciously base their undertakings on the perishable conceptions of "my" and "mine." As long as they do not take shelter of Your safe lotus feet, they are full of such anxieties.

Therefore, without the Lord's mercy, how can he again engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord?

No one other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the localized Paramātmā, the partial representation of the Lord, is directing all inanimate and animate objects. He is present in the three phases of time-past, present and future. Therefore, the conditioned soul is engaged in different activities by His direction, and in order to get free from the threefold miseries of this conditional life, we have to surrender unto Him only.

The living entity in another type of body sees only by instinct; he knows only the agreeable and disagreeable sense perceptions of that particular body.

Therefore, my Lord, although I am living in a terrible condition, I do not wish to depart from my mother's abdomen to fall again into the blind well of materialistic life. Your external energy, called deva-māyā, at once captures the newly born child, and immediately false identification, which is the beginning of the cycle of continual birth and death, begins.

My dear Lord, although personally You have nothing to do, You have distributed Your energies in the interactions of the material modes of nature, and for that reason the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation take place. My dear Lord, You are self-determined and are the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities. For them You created this material manifestation, and although You are one, Your diverse energies can act multifariously. This is inconceivable to us.

Similarly, You have appeared in order to distribute transcendental knowledge to Your dependents.

To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.

Oh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the Āryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required.

I believe, my Lord, that You are Lord Viṣṇu Himself under the name of Kapila, and You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman! The saints and sages, being freed from all the disturbances of the senses and mind, meditate upon You, for by Your mercy only can one become free from the clutches of the three modes of material nature. At the time of dissolution, all the Vedas are sustained in You only.

But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or other he gathered his senses, and with folded hands and sweet words he began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe. The great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu and Lord Śiva, you have divided yourself into three bodies by accepting the three modes of material nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all of you and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my prayer.

O most auspicious lord, you have ordained the heavenly planets, the spiritual Vaikuṇṭha planets and the impersonal Brahman sphere as the respective destinations of the performers of auspicious activities. Similarly, for others, who are miscreants, you have destined different kinds of hells which are horrible and ghastly. Yet sometimes it is found that their destinations are just the opposite. It is very difficult to ascertain the cause of this.

My dear Lord, devotees who have fully dedicated their lives unto your lotus feet certainly observe your presence as Paramātmā in each and every being, and as such they do not differentiate between one living being and another. Such persons treat all living entities equally. They never become overwhelmed by anger like animals, who can see nothing without differentiation.

Thus there is no need for them to be killed again by an exalted personality like you.

My dear lord, if in some places materialists, who are already bewildered by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme Godhead, sometimes commit offenses, a saintly person, with compassion, does not take this seriously. Knowing that they commit offenses because they are overpowered by the illusory energy, he does not show his prowess to counteract them.

My dear Lord Śiva, you are a shareholder of a portion of the sacrifice, and you are the giver of the result. The bad priests did not deliver your share, and therefore you destroyed everything, and the sacrifice remains unfinished. Now you can do the needful and take your rightful share.

Dakṣa addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead: My dear Lord, You are transcendental to all speculative positions. You are completely spiritual, devoid of all fear, and You are always in control of the material energy. Even though You appear in the material energy, You are situated transcendentally. You are always free from material contamination because You are completely self-sufficient.

The priests addressed the Lord, saying: O Lord, transcendental to material contamination, by the curse offered by Lord Śiva's men we have become attached to fruitive activities, and thus we are now fallen and therefore do not know anything about You. On the contrary, we are now involved in the injunctions of the three departments of the Vedic knowledge under the plea of executing rituals in the name of yajṣa. We know that You have made arrangements for distributing the respective shares of the demigods.

The members of the assembly addressed the Lord: O exclusive shelter for all who are situated in troubled life, in this formidable fort of conditional existence the time element, like a snake, is always looking for an opportunity to strike. This world is full of ditches of so-called distress and happiness, and there are many ferocious animals always ready to attack. The fire of lamentation is always blazing, and the mirage of false happiness is always alluring, but one has no shelter from them. Thus foolish persons live in the cycle of birth and death, always overburdened in discharging their so-called duties, and we do not know when they will accept the shelter of Your lotus feet.

With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am no longer disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my activities are not purified. I do not mind their accusations, and I excuse them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion toward all living entities.

Śrī Bhṛgu said: My dear Lord, all living entities, beginning from the highest, namely Lord Brahmā, down to the ordinary ant, are under the influence of the insurmountable spell of illusory energy, and thus they are ignorant of their constitutional position. Everyone believes in the concept of the body, and all are thus submerged in the darkness of illusion. They are actually unable to understand how You live in every living entity as the Supersoul, nor can they understand Your absolute position. But You are the eternal friend and protector of all surrendered souls. Therefore, please be kind toward us and forgive all our offenses.

Lord Brahmā said: My dear Lord, Your personality and eternal form cannot be understood by any person who is trying to know You through the different processes of acquiring knowledge. Your position is always transcendental to the material creation, whereas the empiric attempt to understand You is material, as are its objectives and instruments.

The wives of the performers of the sacrifice said: My dear Lord, this sacrifice was arranged under the instruction of Brahmā, but unfortunately Lord Śiva, being angry at Dakṣa, devastated the entire scene, and because of his anger the animals meant for sacrifice are lying dead. Therefore the preparations of the yajṣa have been lost. Now, by the glance of Your lotus eyes, the sanctity of this sacrificial arena may be again invoked.

The sages prayed: Dear Lord, Your activities are most wonderful, and although You do everything by Your different potencies, You are not at all attached to such activities. You are not even attached to the goddess of fortune, who is worshiped by the great demigods like Brahmā, who pray to achieve her mercy.

I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, and I request that You be pleased on this occasion. The sacrificial arena is not beautiful without You, just as a body is not beautiful without the head.

The governors of various planets spoke as follows: Dear Lord, we believe only in our direct perception, but under the circumstances we do not know whether we have actually seen You with our material senses. By our material senses we can simply perceive the cosmic manifestation, but You are beyond the five elements. You are the sixth. We see You, therefore, as a creation of the material world.

You are very favorable toward those who engage in devotional service, accepting You as the Lord and themselves as the servants. By Your mercy, You are always inclined in their favor.

At that time, all the inhabitants of the higher planets, represented by such liberated souls as Sanaka, were meditating on You by philosophical speculation. You are therefore the original person, and You rest in the water of devastation on the bed of the Śeṣa snake. Now, today, You are visible to us, who are all Your servants. Please give us protection.

He is misled and always attracted by temporary, illusory happiness. But Your transcendental activities are so powerful that if one engages in the hearing and chanting of such topics, he can be delivered from illusion.

The brāhmaṇas said: Dear Lord, You are sacrifice personified. You are the offering of clarified butter, You are the fire, You are the chanting of Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the fuel, You are the flame, You are the kuśa grass, and You are the sacrificial pots. You are the priests who perform the yajṣa, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.

Dear Lord, O personified Vedic knowledge, in the past millennium, long, long ago, when You appeared as the great boar incarnation, You picked up the world from the water, as an elephant picks up a lotus flower from a lake. When You vibrated transcendental sound in that gigantic form of a boar, the sound was accepted as a sacrificial hymn, and great sages like Sanaka meditated upon it and offered prayers for Your glorification.

Dear Lord, we were awaiting Your audience because we have been unable to perform the yajṣas according to the Vedic rituals. We pray unto You, therefore, to be pleased with us. Simply by chanting Your holy name, one can surpass all obstacles. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You in Your presence.

Dhruva Mahārāja said: My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After entering within me, You have enlivened all my sleeping senses—my hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, You are the supreme one, but by Your different energies You appear differently in the spiritual and material worlds. You create the total energy of the material world by Your external potency, and after creation You enter within the material world as the Supersoul. You are the Supreme Person, and through the temporary modes of material nature You create varieties of manifestation, just as fire, entering into wood of different shapes, burns brilliantly in different varieties.

O my master, Lord Brahmā is fully surrendered unto You. In the beginning You gave him knowledge, and thus he could see and understand the entire universe, just as a person awakens from sleep and visualizes his immediate duties. You are the only shelter of all persons who desire liberation, and You are the friend of all who are distressed. How, therefore, can a learned person who has perfect knowledge ever forget You?

nūnam—certainly; vimuṣṭa-matayaḥ—those who have lost their right intelligence; tava—Your; māyayā—by the influence of the illusory energy; te—they; ye—who; tvām—You; bhava—from birth; apyaya—and death; vimokṣaṇam—the cause of liberation; anya-hetoḥ—for other purposes; arcanti—worship; kalpaka-tarum—who are like the desire tree; kuṇapa—of this dead body; upabhogyam—sense gratification; icchanti—they desire; yat—that which; sparśa-jam—derived by touch sensation; niraye—in hell; api—even; nṝṇām—for persons.
Persons who worship You simply for the sense gratification of this bag of skin are certainly influenced by Your illusory energy. In spite of having You, who are like a desire tree and are the cause of liberation from birth and death, foolish persons, such as me, desire benedictions from You for sense gratification, which is available even for those who live in hellish conditions.

yā—that which; nirvṛtiḥ—bliss; tanu-bhṛtām—of the embodied; tava—Your; pāda-padma—lotus feet; dhyānāt—from meditating upon; bhavat-jana—from Your intimate devotees; kathā—topics; śravaṇena—by hearing; vā—or; syāt—comes into being; sā—that bliss; brahmaṇi—in the impersonal Brahman; sva-mahimani—Your own magnificence; api—even; nātha—O Lord; mā—never; bhūt—exists; kim—what to speak of; tu—then; antaka-asi—by the sword of death; lulitāt—being destroyed; patatām—of those who fall down; vimānāt—from their airplanes.
My Lord, the transcendental bliss derived from meditating upon Your lotus feet or hearing about Your glories from pure devotees is so unlimited that it is far beyond the stage of brahmānanda, wherein one thinks himself merged in the impersonal Brahman as one with the Supreme. Since brahmānanda is also defeated by the transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, then what to speak of the temporary blissfulness of elevating oneself to the heavenly planets, which is ended by the separating sword of time? Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, he falls down in due course of time.

Dhruva Mahārāja continued: O unlimited Lord, kindly bless me so that I may associate with great devotees who engage in Your transcendental loving service constantly, as the waves of a river constantly flow. Such transcendental devotees are completely situated in an uncontaminated state of life. By the process of devotional service I shall surely be able to cross the nescient ocean of material existence, which is filled with the waves of blazing, firelike dangers. It will be very easy for me, for I am becoming mad to hear about Your transcendental qualities and pastimes, which are eternally existent.

O Lord who have a lotus navel, if a person happens to associate with a devotee whose heart always hankers after Your lotus feet, seeking always their fragrance, he is never attached to the material body or, in a bodily relationship, to offspring, friends, home, wealth and wife, which are very, very dear to materialistic persons. Indeed, he does not care for them.

My dear Lord, O Supreme Unborn, I know that the different varieties of living entities, such as animals, trees, birds, reptiles, demigods and human beings, are spread throughout the universe, which is caused by the total material energy, and I know that they are sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest; but I have never experienced the supreme form I behold as I see You now. Now all kinds of methods of theorizing have come to an end.

My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium the Supreme Personality of Godhead Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu dissolves everything manifested within the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Śeṣa Nāga, from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord Brahmā is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, by Your unbroken transcendental glance You are the supreme witness of all stages of intellectual activities. You are eternally liberated, Your existence is situated in pure goodness, and You are existent in the Supersoul without change. You are the original Personality of Godhead, full with six opulences, and You are eternally the master of the three modes of material nature. Thus, You are always different from the ordinary living entities. As Lord Viṣṇu, You maintain all the affairs of the entire universe, and yet You stand aloof and are the enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices.

My dear Lord, in Your impersonal manifestation of Brahman there are always two opposing elements—knowledge and ignorance. Your multienergies are continually manifest, but the impersonal Brahman, which is undivided, original, changeless, unlimited and blissful, is the cause of the material manifestation. Because You are the same impersonal Brahman, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, O Supreme Lord, You are the supreme personified form of all benediction. Therefore, for one who abides in Your devotional service with no other desire, worshiping Your lotus feet is better than becoming king and lording it over a kingdom. That is the benediction of worshiping Your lotus feet. To ignorant devotees like me, You are the causelessly merciful maintainer, just like a cow, who takes care of the newly born calf by supplying milk and giving it protection from attack.

The planet earth spoke: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are transcendental in Your position, and by Your material energy You have expanded Yourself in various forms and species of life through the interaction of the three modes of material nature. Unlike some other masters, You always remain in Your transcendental position and are not affected by the material creation, which is subject to different material interactions. Consequently You are not bewildered by material activities.

The planet earth continued: My dear Lord, You are the complete conductor of the material creation. You have created this cosmic manifestation and the three material qualities, and therefore You have created me, the planet earth, the resting place of all living entities. Yet You are always fully independent, my Lord. Now that You are present before me and ready to kill me with Your weapons, let me know where I should go to take shelter, and tell me who can give me protection.

In the beginning of creation You created all these moving and nonmoving living entities by Your inconceivable energy. Through this very same energy You are now prepared to protect the living entities. Indeed, You are the supreme protector of religious principles. Why are You so anxious to kill me, even though I am in the form of a cow?

My dear Lord, although You are one, by Your inconceivable potencies You have expanded Yourself in many forms. Through the agency of Brahmā, You have created this universe. You are therefore directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are not sufficiently experienced cannot understand Your transcendental activities because these persons are covered by Your illusory energy.

My dear Lord, by Your own potencies You are the original cause of the material elements, as well as the performing instruments (the senses), the workers of the senses (the controlling demigods), the intelligence and the ego, as well as everything else. By Your energy You manifest this entire cosmic creation, maintain it and dissolve it. Through Your energy alone everything is sometimes manifest and sometimes not manifest. You are therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My dear Lord, in this way You once protected me by rescuing me from the water, and consequently Your name has been famous as Dharādhara—He who holds the planet earth. Yet at the present moment, in the form of a great hero, You are about to kill me with sharpened arrows. I am, however, just like a boat on the water, keeping everything afloat.

My dear Lord, I am also the creation of one of Your energies, composed of the three modes of material nature. Consequently I am bewildered by Your activities. Even the activities of Your devotees cannot be understood, and what to speak of Your pastimes. Thus everything appears to us to be contradictory and wonderful.

Why, therefore, should any learned person ask You for benedictions meant for living entities bewildered by the modes of nature? Such benedictions are available automatically, even in the lives of living entities suffering in hellish conditions. My dear Lord, You can certainly bestow merging into Your existence, but I do not wish to have such a benediction.

My dear Lord, I therefore do not wish to have the benediction of merging into Your existence, a benediction in which there is no existence of the nectarean beverage of Your lotus feet. I want the benediction of at least one million ears, for thus I may be able to hear about the glories of Your lotus feet from the mouths of Your pure devotees.

My dear Lord, You are glorified by the selected verses uttered by great personalities. Such glorification of Your lotus feet is just like saffron particles. When the transcendental vibration from the mouths of great devotees carries the aroma of the saffron dust of Your lotus feet, the forgetful living entity gradually remembers his eternal relationship with You. Devotees thus gradually come to the right conclusion about the value of life. My dear Lord, I therefore do not need any other benediction but the opportunity to hear from the mouth of Your pure devotee.

My dear highly glorified Lord, if one, in the association of pure devotees, hears even once the glories of Your activities, he does not, unless he is nothing but an animal, give up the association of devotees, for no intelligent person would be so careless as to leave their association. The perfection of chanting and hearing about Your glories was accepted even by the goddess of fortune, who desired to hear of Your unlimited activities and transcendental glories.

Now I wish to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to serve just like the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand, because His Lordship, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. I am afraid that the goddess of fortune and I would quarrel because both of us would be attentively engaged in the same service.

My dear Lord of the universe, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, is the mother of the universe, and yet I think that she may be angry with me because of my intruding upon her service and acting on that very platform to which she is so much attached. Yet I am hopeful that even though there is some misunderstanding, You will take my part, for You are very much inclined to the poor and You always magnify even insignificant service unto You. Therefore even though she becomes angry, I think that there is no harm for You, because You are so self-sufficient that You can do without her.

Great saintly persons who are always liberated take to Your devotional service because only by devotional service can one be relieved from the illusions of material existence. O my Lord, there is no reason for the liberated souls to take shelter at Your lotus feet except that such souls are constantly thinking of Your feet.

Therefore, please do not ask me to take some material benefits from You, but as a father, not waiting for the son's demand, does everything for the benefit of the son, please bestow upon me whatever You think best for me.

However, it is very difficult for them to attain You, whereas a devotee can very easily attain Your Lordship.

Yogis other than the devotees—namely the karma-yogī and jṣāna-yogī—worship You by their respective actions in their respective positions. It is stated both in the Vedas and in the śāstras that are corollaries of the Vedas, and indeed everywhere, that it is only You who are to be worshiped. That is the expert version of all the Vedas.

Thus the material world is created.

Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.

When the Lord, out of His natural compassion, thinks of His devotee, by that process only are all desires of the neophyte devotee fulfilled. The Lord is situated in every living entity's heart, although the living entity may be very insignificant. The Lord knows everything about the living entity, including all his desires. Although we are very insignificant, why should the Lord not know our desires?

We pray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.

Indeed, they recite the holy name again and again.

Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brāhmaṇas, advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.

Dear Lord, even great yogīs and mystics who are very much advanced by virtue of austerities and knowledge and who have completely situated themselves in pure existence, as well as great personalities like Manu, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, cannot fully understand Your glories and potencies. Nonetheless they have offered their prayers according to their own capacities. In the same way, we, although much lower than these personalities, also offer our prayers according to our own capability.

ṛtvijaḥ ūcuḥ—the priests said; arhasi—please (accept); muhuḥ—again and again; arhat-tama—O most exalted, worshipable person; arhaṇam—offering of worship; asmākam—of us; anupathānām—who are Your servants; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; iti—thus; etāvat—so far; sat—by exalted personalities; upaśikṣitam—instructed; kaḥ—what; arhati—is able (to make); pumān—man; prakṛti—of material nature; guṇa—of the modes; vyatikara—in the transformations; matiḥ—whose mind (is absorbed); anīśaḥ—who is most incapable; īśvarasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; parasya—beyond; prakṛti-puruṣayoḥ—the jurisdiction of the three modes of material nature; arvāktanābhiḥ—which do not reach up to, or which are of this material world; nāma-rūpa-ākṛtibhiḥ—by names, forms and qualities; rūpa—of Your nature or position; nirūpaṇam—ascertainment, perception; sakala—all; jana-nikāya—of mankind; vṛjina—sinful actions; nirasana—which wipe out; śivatama—most auspicious; pravara—excellent; guṇa-gaṇa—of the transcendental qualities; eka-deśa—one part; kathanāt—by speaking; ṛte—except.
The priests began to offer prayers to the Lord, saying: O most worshipable one, we are simply Your servants. Although You are full in Yourself, please, out of Your causeless mercy, accept a little service from us, Your eternal servants. We are not actually aware of Your transcendental form, but we can simply offer our respectful obeisances again and again, as instructed by the Vedic literatures and authorized ācāryas. Materialistic living entities are very much attracted to the modes of material nature, and therefore they are never perfect, but You are above the jurisdiction of all material conceptions. Your name, form and qualities are all transcendental and beyond the conception of experimental knowledge. Indeed, who can conceive of You? In the material world we can perceive only material names and qualities. We have no other power than to offer our respectful obeisances and prayers unto You, the transcendental person. The chanting of Your auspicious transcendental qualities will wipe out the sins of all mankind. That is the most auspicious activity for us, and we can thus partially understand Your supernatural position.

All of life's goals and opulences are directly, self-sufficiently, unceasingly and unlimitedly increasing in You at every moment. Indeed, You are unlimited enjoyment and blissful existence itself. As far as we are concerned, O Lord, we are always after material enjoyment. You do not need all these sacrificial arrangements, but they are meant for us so that we may be benedicted by Your Lordship. All these sacrifices are performed for our fruitive results, and they are not actually needed by You.

O Lord of lords, we are completely ignorant of the execution of dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa, the process of liberation, because we do not actually know the goal of life. You have appeared personally before us like a person soliciting worship, but actually You are present here just so we can see You. You have come out of Your abundant and causeless mercy in order to serve our purpose, our interest, and give us the benefit of Your personal glory called apavarga, liberation. You have come, although You are not properly worshiped by us due to our ignorance.

Dear Lord, all the great sages who are thoughtful and saintly persons incessantly recount Your spiritual qualities. These sages have already burned up all the unlimited dirty things and, by the fire of knowledge, strengthened their detachment from the material world. Thus they have attained Your qualities and are self-satisfied. Yet even for those who feel spiritual bliss in chanting Your attributes, Your personal presence is very rare.

Please help us remember You and utter Your holy names, attributes and activities, which can dispel all the reactions of our sinful lives.

Dear Lord, here is the great King Nābhi, whose ultimate goal in life is to have a son like You. Your Lordship, his position is like that of a person approaching a very rich man and begging for a little grain. Mahārāja Nābhi is so desirous of having a son that he is worshiping You for a son, although You can offer him any exalted position, including elevation to the heavenly planets or liberation back to Godhead.

Dear Lord, unless one worships the lotus feet of great devotees, one will be conquered by the illusory energy, and his intelligence will be bewildered. Indeed, who has not been carried away by the waves of material enjoyment, which are like poison? Your illusory energy is unconquerable. No one can see the path of this material energy or tell how it is working.

O Lord, You perform many wonderful activities. Our only aim was to acquire a son by performing this great sacrifice; therefore our intelligence is not very sharp. We are not experienced in ascertaining life's goal. By inviting You to this negligible sacrifice for some material motive, we have certainly committed a great offense at Your lotus feet. Therefore, O Lord of lords, please excuse our offense because of Your causeless mercy and equal mind.

O my Lord, You are the only worshipable person, for You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all opulences. Your secure lotus feet are the only source of protection for all Your devotees, whom You satisfy by manifesting Yourself in various forms. O my Lord, You deliver Your devotees from the clutches of material existence. Nondevotees, however, remain entangled in material existence by Your will. Kindly accept me as Your eternal servant.

We cannot control the force of our anger. Therefore when we look at material things, we cannot avoid feeling attraction or repulsion for them. But the Supreme Lord is never affected in this way. Although He glances over the material world for the purpose of creating, maintaining and destroying it, He is not affected, even to the slightest degree. Therefore, one who desires to conquer the force of the senses must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Then he will be victorious.

asat-dṛśaḥ—for a person with polluted vision; yaḥ—who; pratibhāti—appears; māyayā—the influence of māyā; kṣībaḥ—one who is inebriated or angry; iva—like; madhu—by honey; āsava—and liquor; tāmra-locanaḥ—having eyes reddish like copper; na—not; nāga-vadhvaḥ—the wives of the serpent demon; arhaṇe—in worshiping; īśire—were unable to proceed; hriyā—because of bashfulness; yat-pādayoḥ—of whose lotus feet; sparśana—by the touching; dharṣita—agitated; indriyāḥ—whose senses.
For persons with impure vision, the Supreme Lord's eyes appear like those of someone who indiscriminately drinks intoxicating beverages. Thus bewildered, such unintelligent persons become angry at the Supreme Lord, and due to their angry mood the Lord Himself appears angry and very fearful. However, this is an illusion. When the wives of the serpent demon were agitated by the touch of the Lord's lotus feet, due to shyness they could proceed no further in their worship of Him. Yet the Lord remained unagitated by their touch, for He is equipoised in all circumstances. Therefore who will not worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead?

yam—whom; āhuḥ—they said; asya—of the material world; sthiti—the maintenance; janma—creation; saṁyamam—annihilation; tribhiḥ—these three; vihīnam—without; yam—which; anantam—unlimited; ṝṣayaḥ—all the great sages; na—not; veda—feels; siddha-artham—a mustard seed; iva—like; kvacit—where; sthitam—situated; bhū-maṇḍalam—the universe; mūrdha-sahasra-dhāmasu—on the hundreds and thousands of hoods of the Lord.
Lord Śiva continued: All the great sages accept the Lord as the source of creation, maintenance and destruction, although He actually has nothing to do with these activities. Therefore the Lord is called unlimited. Although the Lord in His incarnation as Śeṣa holds all the universes on His hoods, each universe feels no heavier than a mustard seed to Him. Therefore, what person desiring perfection will not worship the Lord?

yasya—from whom; ādyaḥ—the beginning; āsīt—there was; guṇa-vigrahaḥ—the incarnation of the material qualities; mahān—the total material energy; vijñāna—of full knowledge; dhiṣṇyaḥ—the reservoir; bhagavān—the most powerful; ajaḥ—Lord Brahmā; kila—certainly; yat—from whom; sambhavaḥ—born; aham—I; tri-vṛtā—having three varieties according to the three modes of nature; sva-tejasā—by my material strength; vaikārikam—all the demigods; tāmasam—material elements; aindriyam—the senses; sṛje—I create; ete—all of these; vayam—we; yasya—of whom; vaśe—under the control; mahā-ātmanaḥ—great personalities; sthitāḥ—situated; śakuntāḥ—vultures; iva—like; sūtra-yantritāḥ—bound by rope; mahān—the mahat-tattva; aham—I; vaikṛta—the demigods; tāmasa—the five material elements; indriyāḥ—senses; sṛjāmaḥ—we create; sarve—all of us; yat—of whom; anugrahāt—by the mercy; idam—this material world.
From that Supreme Personality of Godhead appears Lord Brahmā, whose body is made from the total material energy, the reservoir of intelligence predominated by the passionate mode of material nature. From Lord Brahmā, I myself am born as a representation of false ego known as Rudra. By my own power I create all the other demigods, the five elements and the senses. Therefore, I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than any of us and under whose control are situated all the demigods, material elements and senses, and even Lord Brahmā and I myself, like birds bound by a rope. Only by the Lord's grace can we create, maintain and annihilate the material world. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Being.

The illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all of us conditioned souls to this material world. Therefore, without being favored by Him, persons like us cannot understand how to get out of that illusory energy. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who is the cause of creation and annihilation.

The ruler Bhadraśravā and his intimate associates utter the following prayer: We offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all religious principles, who cleanses the heart of the conditioned soul in this material world. Again and again we offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

aho—alas; vicitram—wonderful; bhagavat-viceṣṭitam—the pastimes of the Lord; ghnantam—death; janaḥ—a person; ayam—this; hi—certainly; miṣan—although seeing; na paśyati—does not see; dhyāyan—thinking about; asat—material happiness; yarhi—because; vikarma—forbidden activities; sevitum—to enjoy; nirhṛtya—burning; putram—sons; pitaram—the father; jijīviṣati—desires a long life.
Alas! How wonderful it is that the foolish materialist does not heed the great danger of impending death! He knows that death will surely come, yet he is nevertheless callous and neglectful. If his father dies, he wants to enjoy his father's property, and if his son dies, he wants to enjoy his son's possessions as well. In either case, he heedlessly tries to enjoy material happiness with the acquired money.

vadanti—they say authoritatively; viśvam—the entire material creation; kavayaḥ—great learned sages; sma—certainly; naśvaram—perishable; paśyanti—they see in trance; ca—also; adhyātma-vidaḥ—who have realized spiritual knowledge; vipaścitaḥ—very learned scholars; tathā api—still; muhyanti—become illusioned; tava—your; aja—O unborn one; māyayā—by the illusory energy; su-vismitam—most wonderful; kṛtyam—activity; ajam—unto the supreme unborn one; nataḥ asmi—I offer my obeisances; tam—unto Him.
O unborn one, learned Vedic scholars who are advanced in spiritual knowledge certainly know that this material world is perishable, as do other logicians and philosophers. In trance they realize the factual position of this world, and they preach the truth as well. Yet even they are sometimes bewildered by Your illusory energy. This is Your own wonderful pastime. Therefore, I can understand that Your illusory energy is very wonderful, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

viśva—of the whole universe; udbhava—of the creation; sthāna—of the maintenance; nirodha—of the annihilation; karma—these activities; te—of You (O dear Lord); hi—indeed; akartuḥ—aloof; aṅgīkṛtam—still accepted by the Vedic literature; api—although; apāvṛtaḥ—untouched by all these activities; yuktam—befitting; na—not; citram—wonderful; tvayi—in You; kārya-kāraṇe—the original cause of all effects; sarva-ātmani—in all respects; vyatirikte—set apart; ca—also; vastutaḥ—the original substance.
O Lord, although You are completely detached from the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world and are not directly affected by these activities, they are all attributed to You. We do not wonder at this, for Your inconceivable energies perfectly qualify You to be the cause of all causes. You are the active principle in everything, although You are separate from everything. Thus we can realize that everything is happening because of Your inconceivable energy.

vedān—the four Vedas; yuga-ante—at the end of the millennium; tamasā—by the demon of ignorance personified; tiraskṛtān—stolen away; rasātalāt—from the lowest planetary system (Rasātala); yaḥ—who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); nṛ-turaṅga-vigrahaḥ—assuming the form of half-horse, half-man; pratyādade—returned; vai—indeed; kavaye—to the supreme poet (Lord Brahmā); abhiyā-cate—when he asked for them; tasmai—unto Him (the form of Hayagrīva); namaḥ—my respectful obeisances; te—to You; avitatha-īhitāya—whose resolution never fails; iti—thus.
At the end of the millennium, ignorance personified assumed the form of a demon, stole all the Vedas and took them down to the planet of Rasātala. The Supreme Lord, however, in His form of Hayagrīva retrieved the Vedas and returned them to Lord Brahmā when he begged for them. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, whose determination never fails.

Please appear in our hearts and drive away our ignorance so that by Your mercy we may become fearless in the struggle for existence in this material world.

svasti—auspiciousness; astu—let there be; viśvasya—of the entire universe; khalaḥ—the envious (almost everyone); prasīdatām—let them be pacified; dhyāyantu—let them consider; bhūtāni—all the living entities; śivam—auspiciousness; mithaḥ—mutual; dhiyā—by their intelligence; manaḥ—the mind; ca—and; bhadram—calmness; bhajatāt—let it experience; adhokṣaje—in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the perception of mind, intelligence and senses; āveśyatām—let it be absorbed; naḥ—our; matiḥ—intelligence; api—indeed; ahaitukī—without any motive.
May there be good fortune throughout the universe, and may all envious persons be pacified. May all living entities become calm by practicing bhakti-yoga, for by accepting devotional service they will think of each other's welfare. Therefore let us all engage in the service of the supreme transcendence, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and always remain absorbed in thought of Him.

mā—not; agāra—house; dāra—wife; ātma-ja—children; vitta—bank balance; bandhuṣu—among friends and relatives; saṅgaḥ—association or attachment; yadi—if; syāt—there must be; bhagavat-priyeṣu—among persons to whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear; naḥ—of us; yaḥ—anyone who; prāṇa-vṛttyā—by the bare necessities of life; parituṣṭaḥ—satisfied; ātma-vān—who has controlled his mind and realized his self; siddhyati—becomes successful; adūrāt—very soon; na—not; tathā—so much; indriya-priyaḥ—a person attached to sense gratification.
My dear Lord, we pray that we may never feel attraction for the prison of family life, consisting of home, wife, children, friends, bank balance, relatives and so on. If we do have some attachment, let it be for devotees, whose only dear friend is Kṛṣṇa. A person who is actually self-realized and who has controlled his mind is perfectly satisfied with the bare necessities of life. He does not try to gratify his senses. Such a person quickly advances in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whereas others, who are too attached to material things, find advancement very difficult.

yat-saṅga-labdhaṁ nija-vīrya-vaibhavaṁ
tīrthaṁ muhuḥ saṁspṛśatāṁ hi mānasam

ko vai na seveta mukunda-vikramam
yat—of whom (the devotees); saṅga-labdham—achieved by the association; nija-vīrya-vaibhavam—whose influence is uncommon; tīrtham—holy places like the Ganges; muhuḥ—repeatedly; saṁspṛśatām—of those touching; hi—certainly; mānasam—the dirty things in the mind; harati—vanquishes; ajaḥ—the supreme unborn one; antaḥ—in the core of the heart; śrutibhiḥ—by the ears; gataḥ—entered; aṅga-jam—dirty things or infections of the body; kaḥ—who; vai—indeed; na—not; seveta—would serve; mukunda-vikramam—the glorious activities of Mukunda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
By associating with persons for whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, is the all in all, one can hear of His powerful activities and soon come to understand them. The activities of Mukunda are so potent that simply by hearing of them one immediately associates with the Lord. For a person who constantly and very eagerly hears narrations of the Lord's powerful activities, the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead in the form of sound vibrations, enters within his heart and cleanses it of all contamination. On the other hand, although bathing in the Ganges diminishes bodily contaminations and infections, this process and the process of visiting holy places can cleanse the heart only after a long time. Therefore who is the sane man who will not associate with devotees to quickly perfect his life?

yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā

manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ
yasya—of whom; asti—there is; bhaktiḥ—devotional service; bhagavati—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; akiñcanā—without any motive; sarvaiḥ—with all; guṇaiḥ—good qualities; tatra—there (in that person); samāsate—reside; surāḥ—all the demigods; harau—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; abhaktasya—of a person who is not devoted; kutaḥ—where; mahat-guṇāḥ—good qualities; manorathena—by mental speculation; asati—in the temporary material world; dhāvataḥ—who is running; bahiḥ—outside.
All the demigods and their exalted qualities, such as religion, knowledge and renunciation, become manifest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?

hariḥ—the Lord; hi—certainly; sākṣāt—directly; bhagavān—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; śarīriṇām—of all living entities who have accepted material bodies; ātmā—the life and soul; jhaṣāṇām—of the aquatics; iva—like; toyam—the vast water; īpsitam—is desired; hitvā—giving up; mahān—a great personality; tam—Him; yadi—if; sajjate—becomes attached; gṛhe—to household life; tadā—at that time; mahattvam—greatness; vayasā—by age; dam-patīnām—of the husband and wife.
Just as aquatics always desire to remain in the vast mass of water, all conditioned living entities naturally desire to remain in the vast existence of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if someone very great by material calculations fails to take shelter of the Supreme Soul but instead becomes attached to material household life, his greatness is like that of a young, low-class couple. One who is too attached to material life loses all good spiritual qualities.

tasmāt—therefore; rajaḥ—of passion or material desires; rāga—attachment for material things; viṣāda—then disappointment; manyu—anger; māna-spṛhā—the desire to be respectable in society; bhaya—fear; dainya—of poverty; adhimūlam—the root cause; hitvā—giving up; gṛham—household life; saṁsṛti-cakravālam—the cycle of repeated birth and death; nṛsiṁha-pādam—the lotus feet of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva; bhajata—worship; akutaḥ-bhayam—the shelter of fearlessness; iti—thus.
Therefore, O demons, give up the so-called happiness of family life and simply take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, which are the actual shelter of fearlessness. Entanglement in family life is the root cause of material attachment, indefatigable desires, moroseness, anger, despair, fear and the desire for false prestige, all of which result in the repetition of birth and death.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hṛṣīkeśa, the controller of all my senses and the origin of everything. As the supreme master of all bodily, mental and intellectual activities, He is the only enjoyer of their results. The five sense objects and eleven senses, including the mind, are His partial manifestations. He supplies all the necessities of life, which are His energy and thus nondifferent from Him, and He is the cause of everyone's bodily and mental prowess, which is also nondifferent from Him. Indeed, He is the husband and provider of necessities for all living entities. The purpose of all the Vedas is to worship Him. Therefore let us all offer Him our respectful obeisances. May He always be favorable toward us in this life and the next.

My dear Lord, You are certainly the fully independent master of all the senses. Therefore all women who worship You by strictly observing vows because they wish to acquire a husband to satisfy their senses are surely under illusion. They do not know that such a husband cannot actually give protection to them or their children. Nor can he protect their wealth or duration of life, for he himself is dependent on time, fruitive results and the modes of nature, which are all subordinate to You.

He alone who is never afraid but who, on the contrary, gives complete shelter to all fearful persons can actually become a husband and protector. Therefore, my Lord, you are the only husband, and no one else can claim this position. If you were not the only husband, You would be afraid of others. Therefore persons learned in all Vedic literature accept only Your Lordship as everyone's master, and they think no one else a better husband and protector than You.

My dear Lord, You automatically fulfill all the desires of a woman who worships Your lotus feet in pure love. However, if a woman worships Your lotus feet for a particular purpose, You also quickly fulfill her desires, but in the end she becomes broken-hearted and laments. Therefore one need not worship Your lotus feet for some material benefit.

O supreme unconquerable Lord, when they become absorbed in thoughts of material enjoyment, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, as well as other demigods and demons, undergo severe penances and austerities to receive my benedictions. But I do not favor anyone, however great he may be; unless he is always engaged in the service of Your lotus feet. Because I always keep You within my heart, I cannot favor anyone but a devotee.

O infallible one, Your lotus palm is the source of all benediction. Therefore Your pure devotees worship it, and You very mercifully place Your hand on their heads. I wish that You may also place Your hand on My head, for although You already bear my insignia of golden streaks on Your chest, I regard this honor as merely a kind of false prestige for me. You show Your real mercy to Your devotees, not to me. Of course, You are the supreme absolute controller, and no one can understand Your motives.

I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is pure transcendence. He is the origin of all life, bodily strength, mental power and sensory ability. Known as Matsyāvatāra, the gigantic fish incarnation, He appears first among all the incarnations. Again I offer my obeisances unto Him.

My dear Lord, just as a puppeteer controls his dancing dolls and a husband controls his wife, Your Lordship controls all the living entities in the universe, such as the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras. Although You are in everyone's heart as the supreme witness and commander and are outside everyone as well, the so-called leaders of societies, communities and countries cannot realize You. Only those who hear the vibration of the Vedic mantras can appreciate You.

My Lord, from the great leaders of the universe, such as Lord Brahmā and other demigods, down to the political leaders of this world, all are envious of Your authority. Without Your help, however, they could neither separately nor concertedly maintain the innumerable living entities within the universe. You are actually the only maintainer of all human beings, of animals like cows and asses, and of plants, reptiles, birds, mountains and whatever else is visible within this material world.

O almighty Lord, at the end of the millennium this planet earth, which is the source of all kinds of herbs, drugs and trees, was inundated by water and drowned beneath the devastating waves. At that time, You protected me along with the earth and roamed the sea with great speed. O unborn one, You are the actual maintainer of the entire universal creation, and therefore You are the cause of all living entities. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

om—O my Lord; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; bhagavate—unto You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; akūpārāya—in the form of a tortoise; sarva-sattva-guṇa-viśeṣaṇāya—whose form consists of śuddha-sattva, transcendental goodness; anupalakṣita-sthānāya—unto You, whose position is not discernible; namaḥ—my respectful obeisances; varṣmaṇe—unto You who, although the oldest, are unaffected by time; namaḥ—my respectful obeisances; bhūmne—to the great one who can go everywhere; namaḥ namaḥ—repeated obeisances; avasthānāya—the shelter of everything; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; te—unto You.
O my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who have assumed the form of a tortoise. You are the reservoir of all transcendental qualities, and being entirely untinged by matter, You are perfectly situated in pure goodness. You move here and there in the water, but no one can discern Your position. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Because of Your transcendental position, You are not limited by past, present and future. You are present everywhere as the shelter of all things, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You again and again.

My dear Lord, this visible cosmic manifestation is a demonstration of Your own creative energy. Since the countless varieties of forms within this cosmic manifestation are simply a display of Your external energy, this virāṭ-rūpa [universal body] is not Your real form. Except for a devotee in transcendental consciousness, no one can perceive Your actual form. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My dear Lord, You manifest Your different energies in countless forms: as living entities born from wombs, from eggs and from perspiration; as plants and trees that grow out of the earth; as all living entities, both moving and standing, including the demigods, the learned sages and the pitās; as outer space; as the higher planetary system containing the heavenly planets; and as the planet earth with its hills, rivers, seas, oceans and islands. Indeed, all the stars and planets are simply manifestations of Your different energies, but originally You are one without a second. Therefore there is nothing beyond You. This entire cosmic manifestation is therefore not false but is simply a temporary manifestation of Your inconceivable energy.

O my Lord, Your name, form and bodily features are expanded in countless forms. No one can determine exactly how many forms exist, yet You Yourself, in Your incarnation as the learned scholar Kapiladeva, have analyzed the cosmic manifestation as containing twenty-four elements. Therefore if one is interested in Sāṅkhya philosophy, by which one can enumerate the different truths, he must hear it from You. Unfortunately, nondevotees simply count the different elements and remain ignorant of Your actual form. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

oṁ namo bhagavate mantra-tattva-liṅgāya yajña-kratave mahā-dhvarāvayavāya mahā-puruṣāya namaḥ karma-śuklāya tri-yugāya namas te.
om—O Lord; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; mantra-tattva-liṅgāya—who is understood in truth by different mantras; yajña—in the form of animal sacrifices; kratave—and animal sacrifice; mahā-dhvara—great sacrifices; avayavāya—whose limbs and bodily parts; mahā-puruṣāya—unto the Supreme Person; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; karma-śuklāya—who purifies the fruitive activities of the living entities; tri-yugāya—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is full with six opulences and who appears in three yugas (remaining concealed in the fourth yuga); namaḥ—my respectful obeisances; te—unto You.
O Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You as the gigantic person. Simply by chanting mantras, we shall be able to understand You fully. You are yajña [sacrifice], and You are the kratu [ritual]. Therefore all the ritualistic ceremonies of sacrifice are part of Your transcendental body, and You are the only enjoyer of all sacrifices. Your form is composed of transcendental goodness. You are known as tri-yuga because in Kali-yuga You appear as a concealed incarnation and because You always fully possess the three pairs of opulences.

By manipulating a fire-generating stick, great saints and sages can bring forth the fire lying dormant within wood. In the same way, O Lord, those expert in understanding the Absolute Truth try to see You in everything—even in their own bodies. Yet you remain concealed. You are not to be understood by indirect processes involving mental or physical activities. Because You are self-manifested, only when You see that a person is wholeheartedly engaged in searching for You do You reveal Yourself. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

The objects of material enjoyment [sound, form, taste, touch and smell], the activities of the senses, the controllers of sensory activities [the demigods], the body, eternal time and egotism are all creations of Your material energy. Those whose intelligence has become fixed by perfect execution of mystic yoga can see that all these elements result from the actions of Your external energy. They can also see Your transcendental form as Supersoul in the background of everything. Therefore I repeatedly offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Let me please Your Lordship by chanting the bīja-mantra oṁkāra. I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, who is the best among the most highly elevated personalities. Your Lordship is the reservoir of all the good qualities of Āryans, people who are advanced. Your character and behavior are always consistent, and You always control Your senses and mind. Acting just like an ordinary human being, You exhibit exemplary character to teach others how to behave. There is a touchstone that can be used to examine the quality of gold, but You are like a touchstone that can verify all good qualities. You are worshiped by brāhmaṇas who are the foremost of all devotees. You, the Supreme Person, are the king of kings, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

The Lord, whose pure form [sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]] is uncontaminated by the modes of material nature, can be perceived by pure consciousness. In the Vedānta He is described as being one without a second. Because of His spiritual potency, He is untouched by the contamination of material nature, and because He is not subjected to material vision, He is known as transcendental. He has no material activities, nor has He a material form or name. Only in pure consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, can one perceive the transcendental form of the Lord. Let us be firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Lord Rāmacandra, and let us offer our respectful obeisances unto those transcendental lotus feet.

martya—as a human being; avatāraḥ—whose incarnation; tu—however; iha—in the material world; martya-śikṣaṇam—for teaching all the living entities, especially human beings; rakṣaḥ-vadhāya—to kill the demon Rāvaṇa; eva—certainly; na—not; kevalam—only; vibhoḥ—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kutaḥ—from where; anyathā—otherwise; syāt—there would be; ramataḥ—of one enjoying; sve—in Himself; ātmanaḥ—the spiritual identity of the universe; sītā—of the wife of Lord Rāmacandra; kṛtāni—appearing due to the separation; vyasanāni—all the miseries; īśvarasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
It was ordained that Rāvaṇa, chief of the Rākṣasas, could not be killed by anyone but a man, and for this reason Lord Rāmacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in the form of a human being. Lord Rāmacandra's mission, however, was not only to kill Rāvaṇa but also to teach mortal beings that material happiness centered around sex life or centered around one's wife is the cause of many miseries. He is the self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, and nothing is lamentable for Him. Therefore why else could He be subjected to tribulations by the kidnapping of mother Sītā?

Since Lord Śrī Rāmacandra is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, He is not attached to anything in this material world. He is the most beloved Supersoul of all self-realized souls, and He is their very intimate friend. He is full of all opulences. Therefore He could not possibly have suffered because of separation from His wife, nor could He have given up His wife and Lakṣmaṇa, His younger brother. To give up either would have been absolutely impossible.

One cannot establish a friendship with the Supreme Lord Rāmacandra on the basis of material qualities such as one's birth in an aristocratic family, one's personal beauty, one's eloquence, one's sharp intelligence or one's superior race or nation. None of these qualifications is actually a prerequisite for friendship with Lord Śrī Rāmacandra. Otherwise how is it possible that although we uncivilized inhabitants of the forest have not taken noble births, although we have no physical beauty and although we cannot speak like gentlemen, Lord Rāmacandra has nevertheless accepted us as friends?

Therefore, whether one is a demigod or a demon, a man or a creature other than man, such as a beast or bird, everyone should worship Lord Rāmacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears on this earth just like a human being. There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship the Lord, for He accepts even a small service offered by His devotee. Thus He is satisfied, and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee is successful. Indeed, Lord Śrī Rāmacandra brought all the devotees of Ayodhyā back home, back to Godhead [Vaikuṇṭha].

Nārada, the most powerful saintly sage, also worships Nara-Nārāyaṇa by chanting the following mantra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this visible cosmic manifestation, yet He is completely free from false prestige. Although to the foolish He appears to have accepted a material body like us, He is unaffected by bodily tribulations like hunger, thirst and fatigue. Although He is the witness who sees everything, His senses are unpolluted by the objects He sees. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that unattached, pure witness of the world, the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead.

idaṁ hi yogeśvara yoga-naipuṇaṁ
hiraṇyagarbho bhagavāñ jagāda yat
yad anta-kāle tvayi nirguṇe mano
bhaktyā dadhītojjhita-duṣkalevaraḥ
idam—this; hi—certainly; yoga-īśvara—O my Lord, master of all mystic power; yoga-naipuṇam—the expert process of executing yogic principles; hiraṇya-garbhaḥ—Lord Brahmā; bhagavān—the most powerful; jagāda—spoke; yat—which; yat—which; anta-kāle—at the time of death; tvayi—in You; nirguṇe—the transcendence; manaḥ—the mind; bhaktyā—with a devotional attitude; dadhīta—one should place; ujjhita-duṣkalevaraḥ—having given up his identification with the material body.
O my Lord, master of all mystic yoga, this is the explanation of the yogic process spoken of by Lord Brahmā [Hiraṇyagarbha], who is self-realized. At the time of death, all yogīs give up the material body with full detachment simply by placing their minds at Your lotus feet. That is the perfection of yoga.

yathaihikāmuṣmika-kāma-lampaṭaḥ
suteṣu dāreṣu dhaneṣu cintayan
śaṅketa vidvān kukalevarātyayād
yas tasya yatnaḥ śrama eva kevalam
yathā—as; aihika—in the present life; amuṣmika—in the expected future life; kāma-lampaṭaḥ—a person who is very attached to lusty desires for bodily enjoyment; suteṣu—children; dāreṣu—wife; dhaneṣu—wealth; cintayan—thinking about; śaṅketa—is afraid; vidvān—a person advanced in spiritual knowledge; ku-kalevara—of this body, which is full of stool and urine; atyayāt—because of loss; yaḥ—anyone; tasya—his; yatnaḥ—endeavors; śramaḥ—a waste of time and energy; eva—certainly; kevalam—only.
Materialists are generally very attached to their present bodily comforts and to the bodily comforts they expect in the future. Therefore they are always absorbed in thoughts of their wives, children and wealth and are afraid of giving up their bodies, which are full of stool and urine. If a person engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is also afraid of giving up his body, what is the use of his having labored to study the śāstras? It was simply a waste of time.

tan naḥ prabho tvaṁ kukalevarārpitāṁ
tvan-māyayāhaṁ-mamatām adhokṣaja
bhindyāma yenāśu vayaṁ sudurbhidāṁ

tat—therefore; naḥ—our; prabho—O my Lord; tvam—You; ku-kalevara-arpitām—invested in this bad body full of stool and urine; tvat-māyayā—by Your illusory energy; aham-mamatām—the conception of "I and my"; adhokṣaja—O Transcendence; bhindyāma—may give up; yena—by which; āśu—very soon; vayam—we; sudurbhidām—which is very difficult to give up; vidhehi—please give; yogam—the mystic process; tvayi—unto You; naḥ—our; svabhāvam—which is symptomized by a steady mind; iti—thus.
Therefore, O Lord, O Transcendence, kindly help us by giving us the power to execute bhakti-yoga so that we can control our restless minds and fix them upon You. We are all infected by Your illusory energy; therefore we are very attached to the body, which is full of stool and urine, and to anything related with the body. Except for devotional service, there is no way to give up this attachment. Therefore kindly bestow upon us this benediction.
Song_Demigods Glorification of Birth in Bhārata-varsa (SB 5.19.21-27)

etad eva hi devā gāyanti—
aho amīṣāṁ kim akāri śobhanaṁ
prasanna eṣāṁ svid uta svayaṁ hariḥ
yair janma labdhaṁ nṛṣu bhāratājire
mukunda-sevaupayikaṁ spṛhā hi naḥ
etat—this; eva—indeed; hi—certainly; devāḥ—all the demigods; gāyanti—chant; aho—oh; amīṣām—of these inhabitants of Bhārata-varṣa; kim—what; akāri—was done; śobhanam—pious, beautiful activities; prasannaḥ—pleased; eṣām—upon them; svit—or; uta—it is said; svayam—personally; hariḥ—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; yaiḥ—by whom; janma—birth; labdham—obtained; nṛṣu—in human society; bhārata-ajire—in the courtyard of Bhārata-varṣa; mukunda—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can offer liberation; sevā-aupayikam—which is the means of serving; spṛhā—desire; hi—indeed; naḥ—our.
Since the human form of life is the sublime position for spiritual realization, all the demigods in heaven speak in this way: How wonderful it is for these human beings to have been born in the land of Bhārata-varṣa. They must have executed pious acts of austerity in the past, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself must have been pleased with them. Otherwise, how could they engage in devotional service in so many ways? We demigods can only aspire to achieve human births in Bhārata-varṣa to execute devotional service, but these human beings are already engaged there.

kiṁ duṣkarair naḥ kratubhis tapo-vratair

kim—what is the value; duṣkaraiḥ—very difficult to perform; naḥ—our; kratubhiḥ—with performances of sacrifice; tapaḥ—with austerities; vrataiḥ—vows; dāna-ādibhiḥ—with executing charitable activities and so on; vā—or; dyujayena—with achieving the heavenly kingdom; phalgunā—which is insignificant; na—no; yatra—where; nārāyaṇa-pāda-paṅkaja—of the lotus feet of Lord Nārāyaṇa; smṛtiḥ—the remembrance; pramuṣṭa—lost; atiśaya—excessive; indriya-utsavāt—due to material sense gratification.
The demigods continue: After performing the very difficult tasks of executing Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, undergoing austerities, observing vows and giving charity, we have achieved this position as inhabitants of the heavenly planets. But what is the value of this achievement? Here we are certainly very engaged in material sense gratification, and therefore we can hardly remember the lotus feet of Lord Nārāyaṇa. Indeed, because of our excessive sense gratification, we have almost forgotten His lotus feet.

kalpāyuṣāṁ sthānajayāt punar-bhavāt
kṣaṇāyuṣāṁ bhārata-bhūjayo varam
kṣaṇena martyena kṛtaṁ manasvinaḥ
sannyasya saṁyānty abhayaṁ padaṁ hareḥ
kalpa-āyuṣām—of those who have a life duration of many millions of years, like Lord Brahmā; sthāna-jayāt—than achievement of the place or planetary systems; punaḥ-bhavāt—which is liable to birth, death and old age; kṣaṇa-āyuṣām—of persons who have only one hundred years of life; bhārata-bhū-jayaḥ—a birth in the land of Bhārata-varṣa; varam—more valuable; kṣaṇena—for such a short life; martyena—by the body; kṛtam—the work executed; manasvinaḥ—those actually understanding the value of life; sannyasya—surrendering unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; saṁyānti—they achieve; abhayam—where there is no anxiety; padam—the abode; hareḥ—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
A short life in the land of Bharata-varṣa is preferable to a life achieved in Brahmaloka for millions and billions of years because even if one is elevated to Brahmaloka he must return to repeated birth and death. Although life in Bhārata-varṣa, in a lower planetary system, is very short, one who lives there can elevate himself to full Kṛṣṇa consciousness and achieve the highest perfection, even in this short life, by fully surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Thus one attains Vaikuṇṭhaloka, where there is neither anxiety nor repeated birth in a material body.

na sādhavo bhāgavatās tad-āśrayāḥ
na yatra yajñeśa-makhā mahotsavāḥ

na—not; yatra—where; vaikuṇṭha-kathā-sudhā-āpagāḥ—the nectarean rivers of discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is called Vaikuṇṭha, or one who drives away all anxiety; na—nor; sādhavaḥ—devotees; bhāgavatāḥ—always engaged in the service of the Lord; tat-āśrayāḥ—who are sheltered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; na—nor; yatra—where; yajña-īśa-makhāḥ—the performance of devotional service to the Lord of sacrifices; mahā-utsavāḥ—which are actual festivals; sureśa-lokaḥ—a place inhabited by the denizens of heaven; api—although; na—not; vai—certainly; saḥ—that; sevyatām—be frequented.
An intelligent person does not take interest in a place, even in the topmost planetary system, if the pure Ganges of topics concerning the Supreme Lord's activities does not flow there, if there are not devotees engaged in service on the banks of such a river of piety, or if there are no festivals of saṅkīrtana-yajña to satisfy the Lord [especially since saṅkīrtana-yajña is recommended in this age].

prāptāḥ—who have obtained; nṛ-jātim—a birth in human society; tu—certainly; iha—in this land of Bhārata-varṣa; ye—those who; ca—also; jantavaḥ—the living beings; jñāna—with knowledge; kriyā—with activities; dravya—of ingredients; kalāpa—with a collection; sambhṛtām—full; na—not; vai—certainly; yateran—endeavor; apunaḥ-bhavāya—for the position of immortality; te—such persons; bhūyaḥ—again; vanaukāḥ—birds; iva—like; yānti—go; bandhanam—to bondage.
Bhārata-varṣa offers the proper land and circumstances in which to execute devotional service, which can free one from the results of jñāna and karma. If one obtains a human body in the land of Bhārata-varṣa, with clear sensory organs with which to execute the saṅkīrtana-yajña, but in spite of this opportunity he does not take to devotional service, he is certainly like liberated forest animals and birds that are careless and are therefore again bound by a hunter.

yaiḥ—by whom (the inhabitants of Bhārata-varṣa); śraddhayā—faith and confidence; barhiṣi—in the performance of Vedic ritualistic sacrifices; bhāgaśaḥ—by division; haviḥ—oblations; niruptam—offered; iṣṭam—to the desired deity; vidhi—by the proper method; mantra—by reciting mantras; vastutaḥ—with the proper ingredients; ekaḥ—that one Supreme Personality of Godhead; pṛthak—separate; nāmabhiḥ—by names; āhutaḥ—called; mudā—with great happiness; gṛhṇāti—He accepts; pūrṇaḥ—the Supreme Lord, who is full in Himself; svayam—personally; āśiṣām—of all benedictions; prabhuḥ—the bestower.
In India [Bhārata-varṣa], there are many worshipers of the demigods, the various officials appointed by the Supreme Lord, such as Indra, Candra and Sūrya, all of whom are worshiped differently. The worshipers offer the demigods their oblations, considering the demigods part and parcel of the whole, the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts these offerings and gradually raises the worshipers to the real standard of devotional service by fulfilling their desires and aspirations. Because the Lord is complete, He offers the worshipers the benedictions they desire even if they worship only part of His transcendental body.

satyam—certainly; diśati—He offers; arthitam—the object prayed for; arthitaḥ—being prayed to; nṛṇām—by the human beings; na—not; eva—indeed; artha-daḥ—the bestower of benedictions; yat—which; punaḥ—again; arthitā—a demand for a benediction; yataḥ—from which; svayam—personally; vidhatte—He gives; bhajatām—unto those engaged in His service; anicchatām—although not desiring it; icchā-pidhānam—which covers all desirable things; nija-pāda-pallavam—His own lotus feet.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead fulfills the material desires of a devotee who approaches Him with such motives, but He does not bestow benedictions upon the devotee that will cause him to demand more benedictions again. However, the Lord willingly gives the devotee shelter at His own lotus feet, even though such a person does not aspire for it, and that shelter satisfies all his desires. That is the Supreme Personality's special mercy.

śrī-prajāpatiḥ uvāca—the prajāpati Dakṣa said; namaḥ—all respectful obeisances; parāya—unto the Transcendence; avitatha—correct; anubhūtaye—unto Him whose spiritual potency brings about realization of Him; guṇa-traya—of the three material modes of nature; ābhāsa—of the living entities who have the appearance; nimitta—and of the material energy; bandhave—unto the controller; adṛṣṭa-dhāmne—who is not perceived in His abode; guṇa-tattva-buddhibhiḥ—by the conditioned souls whose poor intelligence dictates that real truth is found in the manifestations of the three modes of material nature; nivṛtta-mānāya—who has surpassed all material measurements and calculations; dadhe—I offer; svayambhuve—unto the Supreme Lord, who is manifest with no cause.
Prajāpati Dakṣa said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the illusory energy and the physical categories it produces. He possesses the potency for unfailing knowledge and supreme willpower, and He is the controller of the living entities and the illusory energy. The conditioned souls who have accepted this material manifestation as everything cannot see Him, for He is above the evidence of experimental knowledge. Self-evident and self-sufficient, He is not caused by any superior cause. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

As the sense objects [form, taste, touch, smell and sound] cannot understand how the senses perceive them, so the conditioned soul, although residing in his body along with the Supersoul, cannot understand how the supreme spiritual person, the master of the material creation, directs his senses. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Person, who is the supreme controller.

dehaḥ—this body; asavaḥ—the life airs; akṣāḥ—the different senses; manavaḥ—the mind, understanding, intellect and ego; bhūta-mātrām—the five gross material elements and the sense objects (form, taste, sound and so on); ātmānam—themselves; anyam—any other; ca—and; viduḥ—know; param—beyond; yat—that which; sarvam—everything; pumān—the living being; veda—knows; guṇān—the qualities of the material nature; ca—and; tat-jñaḥ—knowing those things; na—not; veda—knows; sarva-jñam—unto the omniscient; anantam—the unlimited; īḍe—I offer my respectful obeisances.
Because they are only matter, the body, the life airs, the external and internal senses, the five gross elements and the subtle sense objects [form, taste, smell, sound and touch] cannot know their own nature, the nature of the other senses or the nature of their controllers. But the living being, because of his spiritual nature, can know his body, the life airs, the senses, the elements and the sense objects, and he can also know the three qualities that form their roots. Nevertheless, although the living being is completely aware of them, he is unable to see the Supreme Being, who is omniscient and unlimited. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

yadā—when in trance; uparāmaḥ—complete cessation; manasaḥ—of the mind; nāma-rūpa—material names and forms; rūpasya—of that by which they appear; dṛṣṭa—of material vision; smṛti—and of remembrance; sampramoṣāt—due to the destruction; yaḥ—who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); īyate—is perceived; kevalayā—with spiritual; sva-saṁsthayā—His own original form; haṁsāya—unto the supreme pure; tasmai—unto Him; śuci-sadmane—who is realized only in the pure state of spiritual existence; namaḥ—I offer my respectful obeisances.
When one's consciousness is completely purified of the contamination of material existence, gross and subtle, without being agitated as in the working and dreaming states, and when the mind is not dissolved as in suṣupti, deep sleep, one comes to the platform of trance. Then one's material vision and the memories of the mind, which manifests names and forms, are vanquished. Only in such a trance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead revealed. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seen in that uncontaminated, transcendental state.

manīṣiṇaḥ—great learned brāhmaṇas performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices; antaḥ-hṛdi—within the core of the heart; sanniveśitam—being situated; sva-śaktibhiḥ—with His own spiritual potencies; navabhiḥ—also with the nine different material potencies (the material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of the senses); ca—and (the five gross material elements and the ten acting and knowledge-gathering senses); trivṛdbhiḥ—by the three material modes of nature; vahnim—fire; yathā—just like; dāruṇi—within wood; pāñcadaśyam—produced by chanting the fifteen hymns known as Sāmidhenī mantras; manīṣayā—by purified intelligence; niṣkarṣanti—extract; gūḍham—although not manifesting; saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; vai—indeed; mama—toward me; aśeṣa—all; viśeṣa—varieties; māyā—of the illusory energy; niṣedha—by the process of negation; nirvāṇa—of liberation; sukha-anubhūtiḥ—who is realized by transcendental bliss; saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva-nāmā—who is the source of all names; saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; ca—also; viśva-rūpaḥ—the gigantic form of the universe; prasīdatām—may He be merciful; anirukta—inconceivable; ātma-śaktiḥ—the reservoir of all spiritual potencies.
Just as great learned brāhmaṇas who are expert in performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices can extract the fire dormant within wooden fuel by chanting the fifteen Sāmidhenī mantras, thus proving the efficacy of the Vedic mantras, so those who are actually advanced in consciousness—in other words, those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious—can find the Supersoul, who by His own spiritual potency is situated within the heart. The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements [material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification], and also by the five material elements and the ten senses. These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy of the Lord. Great yogīs meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Paramātmā, within the core of the heart. May that Supersoul be pleased with me. The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life. One actually attains such liberation when he engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of service. The Lord may be addressed by various spiritual names, which are inconceivable to the material senses. When will that Supreme Personality of Godhead be pleased with me?

yat yat—whatever; niruktam—expressed; vacasā—by words; nirūpitam—ascertained; dhiyā—by so-called meditation or intelligence; akṣabhiḥ—by the senses; vā—or; manasā—by the mind; uta—certainly; yasya—of whom; mā bhūt—may not be; sva-rūpam—the actual form of the Lord; guṇa-rūpam—consisting of the three qualities; hi—indeed; tat tat—that; saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; vai—indeed; guṇa-apāya—the cause of the annihilation of everything made of the material modes of nature; visarga—and the creation; lakṣaṇaḥ—appearing as.
Anything expressed by material vibrations, anything ascertained by material intelligence and anything experienced by the material senses or concocted within the material mind is but an effect of the modes of material nature and therefore has nothing to do with the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the material qualities and creation. As the cause of all causes, He exists before the creation and after the creation. I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

yasmin—in whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the supreme place of repose); yataḥ—from whom (everything emanates); yena—by whom (everything is enacted); ca—also; yasya—to whom everything belongs; yasmai—to whom (everything is offered); yat—which; yaḥ—who; yathā—as; kurute—executes; kāryate—is performed; ca—also; para-avareṣām—of both, in the material and spiritual existence; paramam—the supreme; prāk—the origin; prasiddham—well known to everyone; tat—that; brahma—the Supreme Brahman; tat hetuḥ—the cause of all causes; ananyat—having no other cause; ekam—one without a second.
The Supreme Brahman, Kṛṣṇa, is the ultimate resting place and source of everything. Everything is done by Him, everything belongs to Him, and everything is offered to Him. He is the ultimate objective, and whether acting or causing others to act, He is the ultimate doer. There are many causes, high and low, but since He is the cause of all causes, He is well known as the Supreme Brahman who existed before all activities. He is one without a second and has no other cause. I therefore offer my respects unto Him.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who possesses unlimited transcendental qualities. Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all philosophers, who propagate various views, He causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves. Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.

asti—there is; iti—thus; na—not; asti—there is; iti—thus; ca—and; vastu-niṣṭhayoḥ—professing knowledge of the ultimate cause; eka-sthayoḥ—with one and the same subject matter, establishing Brahman; bhinna—demonstrating different; viruddha-dharmaṇoḥ—and opposing characteristics; avekṣitam—perceived; kiñcana—that something which; yoga-sāṅkhyayoḥ—of mystic yoga and the Sāṅkhya philosophy (analysis of the ways of nature); samam—the same; param—transcendental; hi—indeed; anukūlam—dwelling place; bṛhat tat—that ultimate cause.
There are two parties—namely, the theists and the atheists. The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds the spiritual cause through mystic yoga. The Sāṅkhyite, however, who merely analyzes the material elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause—whether Bhagavān, Paramātmā or even Brahman. Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external activities of material nature. Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because although they offer opposing statements their object is the same ultimate cause. They are both approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.

yaḥ—who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); anugraha-artham—to show His causeless mercy; bhajatām—to the devotees who always render devotional service; pāda-mūlam—to His transcendental lotus feet; anāma—with no material name; rūpaḥ—or material form; bhagavān—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; anantaḥ—unlimited, all-pervading and eternally existing; nāmāni—transcendental holy names; rūpāṇi—His transcendental forms; ca—also; janma-karmabhiḥ—with His transcendental birth and activities; bheje—manifests; saḥ—He; mahyam—unto me; paramaḥ—the Supreme; prasīdatu—may He be merciful.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is inconceivably opulent, who is devoid of all material names, forms and pastimes, and who is all-pervading, is especially merciful to the devotees who worship His lotus feet. Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to me.

As the air carries various characteristics of the physical elements, like the aroma of a flower or colors resulting from a mixture of dust in the air, the Lord appears through lower systems of worship according to one's desires, although He appears as the demigods and not in His original form. What is the use of these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.

śrī-devāḥ ūcuḥ—the demigods said; vāyu—composed of air; ambara—sky; agni—fire; ap—water; kṣitayaḥ—and land; tri-lokāḥ—the three worlds; brahma-ādayaḥ—beginning from Lord Brahmā; ye—who; vayam—we; udvijantaḥ—being very much afraid; harāma—offer; yasmai—unto whom; balim—presentation; antakaḥ—the destroyer, death; asau—that; bibheti—fears; yasmāt—from whom; araṇam—shelter; tataḥ—therefore; naḥ—our.
The demigods said: The three worlds are created by the five elements—namely ether, air, fire, water and earth—which are controlled by various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahmā. Being very much afraid that the time factor will end our existence, we offer presentations unto time by performing our work as time dictates. The time factor himself, however, is afraid of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore let us now worship that Supreme Lord, who alone can give us full protection.

avismitaṁ taṁ paripūrṇa-kāmaṁ

avismitam—who is never struck with wonder; tam—Him; paripūrṇa-kāmam—who is fully satisfied; svena—by His own; eva—indeed; lābhena—achievements; samam—equipoised; praśāntam—very steady; vinā—without; upasarpati—approaches; aparam—another; hi—indeed; bāliśaḥ—a fool; śva—of a dog; lāṅgulena—by the tail; atititarti—wants to cross; sindhum—the sea.
Free from all material conceptions of existence and never wonder-struck by anything, the Lord is always jubilant and fully satisfied by His own spiritual perfection. He has no material designations, and therefore He is steady and unattached. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter of everyone. Anyone desiring to be protected by others is certainly a great fool who desires to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog.

yasya—of whom; uru—very strong and high; śṛṅge—on the horn; jagatīm—in the form of the world; sva-nāvam—his own boat; manuḥ—Manu, King Satyavrata; yathā—just as; ābadhya—binding; tatāra—crossed; durgam—the very difficult to cross (inundation); saḥ—He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva—certainly; naḥ—us; tvāṣṭra-bhayāt—from fear of the son of Tvaṣṭā; durantāt—endless; trātā—deliverer; āśritān—dependents (like us); vāri-caraḥ api—although taking the form of a fish; nūnam—indeed.
The Manu named King Satyavrata formerly saved himself by tying the small boat of the entire world to the horn of the Matsya avatāra, the fish incarnation. By the grace of the Matsya avatāra, Manu saved himself from the great danger of the flood. May that same fish incarnation save us from the great and fearful danger caused by the son of Tvaṣṭā.

purā—formerly (during the time of creation); svayambhūḥ—Lord Brahmā; api—also; saṁyama-ambhasi—in the water of inundation; udīrṇa—very high; vāta—of wind; ūrmi—and of waves; ravaiḥ—by the sounds; karāle—very fearful; ekaḥ—alone; aravindāt—from the lotus seat; patitaḥ—almost fallen; tatāra—escaped; tasmāt—from that; bhayāt—fearful situation; yena—by whom (the Lord); saḥ—He; naḥ—of us; astu—let there be; pāraḥ—deliverance.
In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water. The great waves made such a horrible sound that Lord Brahmā almost fell from his seat on the lotus into the water of devastation, but he was saved with the help of the Lord. Thus we also expect the Lord to protect us from this dangerous condition.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created us by His external potency and by whose mercy we expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods.

yaḥ—He who; naḥ—us; sapatnaiḥ—by our enemies, the demons; bhṛśam—almost always; ardyamānān—being persecuted; deva—among the demigods; ṛṣi—the saintly persons; tiryak—the animals; nṛṣu—and men; nityaḥ—always; eva—certainly; kṛta-avatāraḥ—appearing as an incarnation; tanubhiḥ—with different forms; sva-māyayā—by His internal potency; kṛtvā ātmasāt—considering very near and dear to Him; pāti—protects; yuge yuge—in every millennium; ca—and; tam—Him; eva—indeed; devam—the Supreme Lord; vayam—all of us; ātma-daivatam—the Lord of all living entities; param—transcendental; pradhānam—the original cause of the total material energy; puruṣam—the supreme enjoyer; viśvam—whose energy constitutes this universe; anyam—separately situated; vrajāma—we approach; sarve—all; śaraṇam—shelter; śaraṇyam—suitable as shelter; svānām—unto His own devotees; saḥ—He; naḥ—unto us; dhāsyati—shall give; śam—good fortune; mahātmā—the Supersoul.
By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various transcendental bodies as Vāmanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Paraśurāma, the incarnation among saints; Nṛsiṁhadeva and Varāha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kūrma, incarnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Rāma. By His causeless mercy, He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons. He is the supreme worshipable Deity of all living entities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [virāṭ-rūpa]. In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give us His protection.

śrī-devāḥ ūcuḥ—the demigods said; namaḥ—obeisances; te—unto You; yajña-vīryāya—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is able to give the results of sacrifice; vayase—who is the time factor, which ends the results of yajña; uta—although; te—unto You; namaḥ—obeisances; namaḥ—obeisances; te—unto You; hi—indeed; asta-cakrāya—who throws the disc; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; supuru-hūtaye—having varieties of transcendental names.
The demigods said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are competent to give the results of sacrifice, and You are also the time factor that destroys all such results in due course. You are the one who releases the cakra to kill the demons. O Lord, who possess many varieties of names, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

yat—which; te—of You; gatīnām tisṛṇām—of the three destinations (the heavenly planets, the earthly planets and hell); īśituḥ—who are the controller; paramam padam—the supreme abode, Vaikuṇṭhaloka; na—not; arvācīnaḥ—a person appearing after; visargasya—the creation; dhātaḥ—O supreme controller; veditum—to understand; arhati—is able.
O supreme controller, You control the three destinations [promotion to the heavenly planets, birth as a human being, and condemnation in hell], yet Your supreme abode is Vaikuṇṭha-dhāma. Since we appeared after You created this cosmic manifestation, Your activities are impossible for us to understand. We therefore have nothing to offer You but our humble obeisances.

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Nārāyaṇa, O Vāsudeva, original person! O most exalted person, supreme experience, welfare personified! O supreme benediction, supremely merciful and changeless! O support of the cosmic manifestation, sole proprietor of all planetary systems, master of everything and husband of the goddess of fortune! Your Lordship is realized by the topmost sannyāsīs, who wander about the world to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, fully absorbed in samādhi through bhakti-yoga. Because their minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive the conception of Your personality in their fully purified hearts. When the darkness in their hearts is completely eradicated and You are revealed to them, the transcendental bliss they enjoy is the transcendental form of Your Lordship. No one but such persons can realize You. Therefore we simply offer You our respectful obeisances.

duravabodhaḥ—difficult to understand; iva—quite; tava—Your; ayam—this; vihāra-yogaḥ—engagement in the pastimes of material creation, maintenance and annihilation; yat—which; aśaraṇaḥ—not dependent on any other support; aśarīraḥ—without having a material body; idam—this; anavekṣita—without waiting for; asmat—of us; samavāyaḥ—the cooperation; ātmanā—by Your own self; eva—indeed; avikriyamāṇena—without being transformed; sa-guṇam—the material modes of nature; aguṇaḥ—although transcendental to such material qualities; sṛjasi—You create; pāsi—maintain; harasi—annihilate.
O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation from us. Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself. Nevertheless, although You appear engaged in material activity, You are transcendental to all material qualities. Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.

atha—therefore; tatra—in that; bhavān—Your Lordship; kim—whether; deva-datta-vat—like an ordinary human being, forced by the fruits of his activities; iha—in this material world; guṇa-visarga-patitaḥ—fallen in a material body impelled by the modes of material nature; pāratantryeṇa—by dependence on the conditions of time, space, activity and nature; sva-kṛta—executed by oneself; kuśala—auspicious; akuśalam—inauspicious; phalam—results of action; upādadāti—accepts; āhosvit—or; ātmārāmaḥ—completely self-satisfied; upaśama-śīlaḥ—self-controlled in nature; samañjasa-darśanaḥ—not deprived of full spiritual potencies; udāste—remains neutral as the witness; iti—thus; ha vāva—certainly; na vidāmaḥ—we do not understand.
These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus receives the fruits of his actions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual position.

na—not; hi—certainly; virodhaḥ—contradiction; ubhayam—both; bhagavati—in the Supreme Personality of Godhead; aparimita—unlimited; guṇa-gaṇe—whose transcendental attributes; īśvare—in the supreme controller; anavagāhya—possessing; māhātmye—unfathomable ability and glories; arvācīna—recent; vikalpa—full of equivocal calculations; vitarka—opposing arguments; vicāra—judgments; pramāṇa-ābhāsa—imperfect evidence; kutarka—useless arguments; śāstra—by unauthorized scriptures; kalila—agitated; antaḥkaraṇa—minds; āśraya—whose shelter; duravagraha—with wicked obstinacies; vādinām—of theorists; vivāda—of the controversies; anavasare—not within the range; uparata—withdrawn; samasta—from whom all; māyā-maye—illusory energy; kevale—without a second; eva—indeed; ātma-māyām—the illusory energy, which can do and undo the inconceivable; antardhāya—placing between; kaḥ—what; nu—indeed; arthaḥ—meaning; durghaṭaḥ—impossible; iva—as it were; bhavati—is; sva-rūpa—natures; dvaya—of two; abhāvāt—due to the absence.
O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress, are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.

sama-viṣama-matīnāṁ matam anusarasi yathā rajju-khaṇḍaḥ sarpādi-dhiyām.
sama—equal or proper; viṣama—and unequal or mistaken; matīnām—of those having intelligence; matam—conclusion; anusarasi—You follow; yathā—just as; rajju-khaṇḍaḥ—a piece of rope; sarpa-ādi—a snake, etc.; dhiyām—of those who perceive.
A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a snake, but not for a person with proper intelligence who knows it to be only a rope. Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone's heart, inspire fear or fearlessness according to one's intelligence, but in You there is no duality.

saḥ—He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva—indeed; hi—certainly; punaḥ—again; sarva-vastuni—in everything, material and spiritual; vastu-svarūpaḥ—the substance; sarva-īśvaraḥ—the controller of everything; sakala-jagat—of the whole universe; kāraṇa—of the causes; kāraṇa-bhūtaḥ—existing as the cause; sarva-pratyak-ātmatvāt—because of being the Supersoul of every living being, or being present in everything, even the atom; sarva-guṇa—of all the effects of the material modes of nature (such as intelligence and the senses); ābhāsa—by the manifestations; upalakṣitaḥ—perceived; ekaḥ—alone; eva—indeed; paryavaśeṣitaḥ—left remaining.
With deliberation, one will see that the Supreme Soul, although manifested in different ways, is actually the basic principle of everything. The total material energy is the cause of the material manifestation, but the material energy is caused by Him. Therefore He is the cause of all causes, the manifester of intelligence and the senses. He is perceived as the Supersoul of everything. Without Him, everything would be dead. You, as that Supersoul, the supreme controller, are the only one remaining.

atha ha—therefore; vāva—indeed; tava—Your; mahima—of glories; amṛta—of the nectar; rasa—of the mellow; samudra—of the ocean; vipruṣā—by a drop; sakṛt—only once; avalīḍhayā—tasted; sva-manasi—in his mind; niṣyandamāna—flowing; anavarata—continuously; sukhena—by the transcendental bliss; vismārita—forgotten; dṛṣṭa—from material sight; śruta—and sound; viṣaya-sukha—of the material happiness; leśa-ābhāsāḥ—the dim reflection of a tiny portion; parama-bhāgavatāḥ—great, exalted devotees; ekāntinaḥ—who have faith only in the Supreme Lord and nothing else; bhagavati—in the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva-bhūta—to all living entities; priya—who is dearmost; suhṛdi—the friend; sarva-ātmani—the Supersoul of all; nitarām—completely; nirantaram—continuously; nirvṛta—with happiness; manasaḥ—those whose minds; katham—how; u ha—then; vā—or; ete—these; madhu-mathana—O killer of the Madhu demon; punaḥ—again; sva-artha-kuśalāḥ—who are expert in the interest of life; hi—indeed; ātma-priya-suhṛdaḥ—who have accepted You as the Supersoul, dearmost lover and friend; sādhavaḥ—the devotees; tvat-caraṇa-ambuja-anusevām—service to the lotus feet of Your Lordship; visṛjanti—can give up; na—not; yatra—wherein; punaḥ—again; ayam—this; saṁsāra-paryāvartaḥ—repetition of birth and death within the material world.
Therefore, O killer of the Madhu demon, incessant transcendental bliss flows in the minds of those who have even once tasted but a drop of the nectar from the ocean of Your glories. Such exalted devotees forget the tiny reflection of so-called material happiness produced from the material senses of sight and sound. Free from all desires, such devotees are the real friends of all living entities. Offering their minds unto You and enjoying transcendental bliss, they are expert in achieving the real goal of life. O Lord, You are the soul and dear friend of such devotees, who never need return to this material world. How could they give up engagement in Your devotional service?

O Lord, O personified three worlds, father of the three worlds! O strength of the three worlds, in the form of the Vāmana incarnation! O three-eyed form of Nṛsiṁhadeva! O most beautiful person within the three worlds! Everything and everyone, including human beings and even the Daitya demons and the Dānavas, is but an expansion of Your energy. O supremely powerful one, You have always appeared in Your forms as the various incarnations to punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful. You appear as Lord Vāmanadeva, Lord Rāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa. You appear sometimes as an animal like Lord Boar, sometimes a mixed incarnation like Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva and Lord Hayagrīva, and sometimes an aquatic like Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise. Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the demons and Dānavas. We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another incarnation, if You so desire, to kill the great demon Vṛtrāsura.

Now please manifest Your incarnation. Accepting us as Your own eternal servants and devotees, be pleased with us and sympathetic toward us. By Your love-filled glance, with its cool and pleasing smile of sympathy, and by the sweet, nectarean words emanating from Your beautiful face, free us from the anxiety caused by this Vṛtrāsura, who always pains the cores of our hearts.

atha—therefore; bhagavan—O Lord; tava—of You; asmābhiḥ—by us; akhila—all; jagat—of the material world; utpatti—of the creation; sthiti—maintenance; laya—and annihilation; nimittāyamāna—being the cause; divya-māyā—with the spiritual energy; vinodasya—of You, who amuse Yourself; sakala—all; jīva-nikāyānām—of the hordes of living entities; antaḥ-hṛdayeṣu—in the cores of the hearts; bahiḥ api—externally also; ca—and; brahma—of impersonal Brahman, or the Absolute Truth; pratyak-ātma—of the Supersoul; sva-rūpeṇa—by Your forms; pradhāna-rūpeṇa—by Your form as the external ingredients; ca—also; yathā—according to; deśa-kāla-deha-avasthāna—of country, time, body and position; viśeṣam—the particulars; tat—of them; upādāna—of the material causes; upalambhakatayā—by being the exhibitor; anubhavataḥ—witnessing; sarva-pratyaya-sākṣiṇaḥ—the witness of all different activities; ākāśa-śarīrasya—the Supersoul of the whole universe; sākṣāt—directly; para-brahmaṇaḥ—the Supreme Absolute Truth; paramātmanaḥ—the Supersoul; kiyān—of what extent; iha—herein; vā—or; artha-viśeṣaḥ—special necessity; vijñāpanīyaḥ—to be informed; syāt—may be; visphuliṅga-ādibhiḥ—by the sparks of the fire; iva—like; hiraṇya-retasaḥ—to the original fire.
O Lord, as the small sparks of a fire cannot possibly perform the actions of the whole fire, we sparks of Your Lordship cannot inform You of the necessities of our lives. You are the complete whole. Therefore, of what do we need to inform You? You know everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire universal creation. You always engage in Your pastimes with Your spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all these varied energies. You exist within all living entities, within the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them. You exist internally as Para-brahman and externally as the ingredients of the material creation. Therefore, although manifested in various stages, at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the Personality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes. Indeed, You are the original element. You are the witness of all activities, but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by any of them. You are the witness of everything as Para-brahman and Paramātmā. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, nothing is unknown to You.

Dear Lord, You are omniscient, and therefore You know very well why we have taken shelter at Your lotus feet, which provide shade that gives relief from all material disturbances. Since You are the supreme spiritual master and You know everything, we have sought shelter of Your lotus feet for instruction. Please give us relief by counteracting our present distress. Your lotus feet are the only shelter for a fully surrendered devotee and are the only means for subduing all the tribulations of this material world.

O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone's heart and observe all the desires and activities of the conditioned souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Kṛṣṇa, Your reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no beginning, for You are the beginning of everything. This is understood by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and truthful. When the conditioned souls are liberated and sheltered at Your lotus feet after roving throughout the material world for many millions of years, they attain the highest success of life. Therefore, O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we offer our respectful obeisances at Your lotus feet.

oṁ—O my Lord; namaḥ—obeisances; tubhyam—unto You; bhagavate—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vāsudevāya—Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva; dhīmahi—let me meditate upon; pradyumnāya—unto Pradyumna; aniruddhāya—unto Aniruddha; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; saṅkarṣaṇāya—unto Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa; ca—also; namaḥ—all obeisances; vijñāna-mātrāya—unto the form full of knowledge; parama-ānanda-mūrtaye—full of transcendental bliss; ātma-ārāmāya—unto the Lord, who is self-sufficient; śāntāya—and free from disturbances; nivṛtta-dvaita-dṛṣṭaye—whose vision turns away from duality, or who is one without a second.
[Nārada gave Citraketu the following mantra.] O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, who are addressed by the oṁkāra [praṇava], I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. O Lord Vāsudeva, I meditate upon You. O Lord Pradyumna, Lord Aniruddha and Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa, I offer You my respectful obeisances. O reservoir of spiritual potency, O supreme bliss, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are self-sufficient and most peaceful. O ultimate truth, one without a second, You are realized as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān and are therefore the reservoir of all knowledge. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

ātma-ānanda—of Your personal bliss; anubhūtyā—by perception; eva—certainly; nyasta—given up; śakti-ūrmaye—the waves of material nature; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; hṛṣīkeśāya—unto the supreme controller of the senses; mahate—unto the Supreme; namaḥ—respectful obeisances; te—unto You; ananta—unlimited; mūrtaye—whose expansions.
Perceiving Your personal bliss, You are always transcendental to the waves of material nature. Therefore, my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the supreme controller of the senses, and Your expansions of form are unlimited. You are the greatest, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

vacasy uparate 'prāpya

vacasi—when the words; uparate—cease; aprāpya—not achieving the goal; yaḥ—He who; ekaḥ—one without a second; manasā—the mind; saha—with; anāma—with no material name; rūpaḥ—or material form; cit-mātraḥ—totally spiritual; saḥ—He; avyāt—may kindly protect; naḥ—us; sat-asat-paraḥ—who is the cause of all causes (the supreme cause).
The words and mind of the conditioned soul cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for material names and forms are not applicable to the Lord, who is entirely spiritual, beyond the conception of gross and subtle forms. The impersonal Brahman is another of His forms. May He, by His pleasure, protect us.

yasmin—in whom; idam—this (cosmic manifestation); yataḥ—from whom; ca—also; idam—this (cosmic manifestation); tiṣṭhati—stands; apyeti—dissolves; jāyate—is born; mṛt-mayeṣu—in things made of earth; iva—like; mṛt-jātiḥ—birth from earth; tasmai—unto Him; te—You; brahmaṇe—the supreme cause; namaḥ—respectful obeisances.
As pots made completely of earth are situated on earth after being created and are transformed into earth again when broken, this cosmic manifestation is caused by the Supreme Brahman, situated in the Supreme Brahman, and annihilated in the same Supreme Brahman. Therefore, since the Supreme Lord is the cause of Brahman, let us offer Him our respectful obeisances.

The Supreme Brahman emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and expands like the sky. Although untouched by anything material, it exists within and without. Nonetheless, the mind, intelligence, senses and living force can neither touch Him nor know Him. I offer unto Him my respectful obeisances.

deha—the body; indriya—senses; prāṇa—life airs; manaḥ—mind; dhiyaḥ—and intelligence; amī—all those; yat-aṁśa-viddhāḥ—being influenced by rays of Brahman, or the Supreme Lord; pracaranti—they move; karmasu—in various activities; na—not; eva—indeed; anyadā—at other times; lauham—iron; iva—like; aprataptam—not heated (by fire); sthāneṣu—in those circumstances; tat—that; draṣṭṛ-apadeśam—the name of a subject matter; eti—achieves.
As iron has the power to burn when made red-hot in the association of fire, so the body, senses, living force, mind and intelligence, although merely lumps of matter, can function in their activities when infused with a particle of consciousness by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As iron cannot burn unless heated by fire, the bodily senses cannot act unless favored by the Supreme Brahman.

O transcendental Lord, who are situated in the topmost planet of the spiritual world, Your two lotus feet are always massaged by a multitude of the best devotees with their lotus-bud hands. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, complete in six opulences. You are the supreme person mentioned in the Puruṣa-sūkta prayers. You are the most perfect, self-realized master of all mystic power. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

citraketuḥ uvāca—King Citraketu said; ajita—O my unconquerable Lord; jitaḥ—conquered; sama-matibhiḥ—by persons who have conquered the mind; sādhubhiḥ—the devotees; bhavān—Your Lordship; jita-ātmabhiḥ—who have completely controlled the senses; bhavatā—by You; vijitāḥ—conquered; te—they; api—also; ca—and; bhajatām—to those who always engage in Your service; akāma-ātmanām—with no motives for material profit; yaḥ—who; ātma-daḥ—giving Yourself; ati-karuṇaḥ—extremely merciful.
Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses. They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.

tava—Your; vibhavaḥ—opulences; khalu—indeed; bhagavan—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; jagat—of the cosmic manifestation; udaya—the creation; sthiti—maintenance; laya-ādīni—dissolution and so on; viśva-sṛjaḥ—the creators of the manifested world; te—they; aṁśa-aṁśāḥ—parts of Your plenary portion; tatra—in that; mṛṣā—in vain; spardhanti—rival one another; pṛthak—of separateness; abhimatyā—by a false conception.
My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your opulences. Since Lord Brahmā and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You, their partial power to create does not make them God [īśvara]. Their consciousness of themselves as separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige. It is not valid.

parama-aṇu—of the atomic particle; parama-mahatoḥ—and of the biggest (the result of the combination of atoms); tvam—You; ādi-anta—in both the beginning and the end; antara—and in the middle; vartī—existing; traya-vidhuraḥ—although without beginning, end or middle; ādau—in the beginning; ante—at the end; api—also; ca—and; sattvānām—of all existences; yat—which; dhruvam—permanent; tat—that; eva—certainly; antarāle—in the middle; api—also.
You exist in the beginning, middle and end of everything, from the most minute particle of the cosmic manifestation—the atom—to the gigantic universes and total material energy. Nonetheless, You are eternal, having no beginning, end or middle. You are perceived to exist in these three phases, and thus You are permanent. When the cosmic manifestation does not exist, You exist as the original potency.

Every universe is covered by seven layers—earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego—each ten times greater than the previous one. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited [ananta].

viṣaya-tṛṣaḥ—eager to enjoy sense gratification; nara-paśavaḥ—manlike animals; ye—who; upāsate—worship very gorgeously; vibhūtīḥ—small particles of the Supreme Lord (the demigods); na—not; param—the Supreme; tvām—You; teṣām—of them; āśiṣaḥ—the benedictions; īśa—O supreme controller; tat—them (the demigods); anu—after; vinaśyanti—will be vanquished; yathā—just as; rāja-kulam—those who are supported by the government (when the government is finished).
O Lord, O Supreme, unintelligent persons who thirst for sense enjoyment and who worship various demigods are no better than animals in the human form of life. Because of their animalistic propensities, they fail to worship Your Lordship, and instead they worship the insignificant demigods, who are but small sparks of Your glory. With the destruction of the entire universe, including the demigods, the benedictions received from the demigods also vanish, just like the nobility when a king is no longer in power.

kāma-dhiyaḥ—desires for sense gratification; tvayi—in You; racitāḥ—performed; na—not; parama—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; rohanti—do grow (produce other bodies); yathā—just as; karambha-bījāni—sterilized or fried seeds; jñāna-ātmani—in You, whose existence is in full knowledge; aguṇa-maye—who is not affected by the material qualities; guṇa-gaṇataḥ—from the material qualities; asya—of a person; dvandva-jālāni—the networks of duality.
O Supreme Lord, if persons obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material opulence worship You, who are the source of all knowledge and are transcendental to material qualities, they are not subject to material rebirth, just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants. Living entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature, but since You are transcendental, one who is inclined to associate with You in transcendence escapes the conditions of material nature.

jitam—conquered; ajita—O unconquerable one; tadā—then; bhavatā—by Your Lordship; yadā—when; āha—spoke; bhāgavatam—which helps the devotee approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead; dharmam—the religious process; anavadyam—faultless (free from contamination); niṣkiñcanāḥ—who have no desire to be happy with material opulences; ye—those who; munayaḥ—great philosophers and exalted sages; ātma-ārāmāḥ—who are self-satisfied (being completely aware of their constitutional position as eternal servants of the Lord); yam—whom; upāsate—worship; apavargāya—for achieving liberation from material bondage.
O unconquerable one, when You spoke about bhāgavata-dharma, which is the uncontaminated religious system for achieving the shelter of Your lotus feet, that was Your victory. Persons who have no material desires, like the Kumāras, who are self-satisfied sages, worship You to be liberated from material contamination. In other words, they accept the process of bhāgavata-dharma to achieve shelter at Your lotus feet.

Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhāgavata-dharma work under conceptions of fruitive results and distinctions of "you and I" and "yours and mine." The followers of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam have no such consciousness. They are all Kṛṣṇa conscious, thinking that they are Kṛṣṇa's and Kṛṣṇa is theirs. There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.

How can a religious system that produces envy of one's self and of others be beneficial for oneself and for them? What is auspicious about following such a system? What is actually to be gained? By causing pain to one's own self due to self-envy and by causing pain to others, one arouses Your anger and practices irreligion.

My dear Lord, one's occupational duty is instructed in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and the Bhagavad-gītā according to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life. Those who follow their occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and not considering high and low, are called Āryans. Such Āryans worship You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My Lord, it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing You. Not to speak of seeing You personally, merely by hearing the holy name of Your Lordship only once, even caṇḍālas, men of the lowest class, are freed from all material contamination. Under the circumstances, who will not be freed from material contamination simply by seeing You?

Therefore, my dear Lord, simply seeing You has now wiped away all the contamination of sinful activities and their results of material attachment and lusty desires, which always filled my mind and the core of my heart. Whatever is predicted by the great sage Nārada Muni cannot be otherwise. In other words, I have obtained Your audience as a result of being trained by Nārada Muni.

O unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead, whatever a living entity does in this material world is well known to You because You are the Supersoul. In the presence of the sun there is nothing to be revealed by the light of a glowworm. Similarly, because You know everything, in Your presence there is nothing for me to make known.

namaḥ—all obeisances; tubhyam—unto You; bhagavate—Your Lordship; sakala—all; jagat—of the cosmic manifestation; sthiti—of the maintenance; laya—dissolution; udaya—and creation; īśāya—unto the Supreme Lord; duravasita—impossible to understand; ātma-gataye—whose own position; ku-yoginām—of those who are attached to the objects of the senses; bhidā—by the false understanding of separateness; parama-haṁsāya—unto the supreme pure.
My dear Lord, You are the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this cosmic manifestation, but persons who are too materialistic and who always see separateness do not have eyes with which to see You. They cannot understand Your real position, and therefore they conclude that the cosmic manifestation is independent of Your opulence. My Lord, You are the supreme pure, and You are full in all six opulences. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My dear Lord, it is after You endeavor that Lord Brahmā, Indra and the other directors of the cosmic manifestation become occupied with their activities. It is after You perceive the material energy, My Lord, that the senses begin to perceive. The Supreme Personality of Godhead holds all the universes on His heads like seeds of mustard. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, that Supreme Personality, who has thousands of hoods.

Through the material qualities, You very easily create the universe, maintain it and again annihilate it, yet You remain the same, without deterioration. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

śrī-indra uvāca
pratyānītāḥ parama bhavatā trāyatā naḥ sva-bhāgā
daityākrāntaṁ hṛdaya-kamalaṁ tad-gṛhaṁ pratyabodhi

King Indra said: O Supreme Lord, You are our deliverer and protector. Our shares of sacrifices, which are actually Yours, have been recovered from the demon by You. Because the demoniac king Hiraṇyakaśipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is insignificant. They do not even care for liberation, not to speak of the benefits of kāma, artha and dharma.

All the saintly persons present offered their prayers in this way: O Lord, O supreme maintainer of those sheltered at Your lotus feet, O original Personality of Godhead, the process of austerity and penance, in which You instructed us before, is the spiritual power of Your very self. It is by austerity that You create the material world, which lies dormant within You. This austerity was almost stopped by the activities of this demon, but now, by Yourself appearing in the form of Nṛsiṁhadeva, which is meant just to give us protection, and by killing this demon, You have again approved the process of austerity.

The inhabitants of Pitṛloka prayed: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, the maintainer of the religious principles of the universe. He has killed Hiraṇyakaśipu, the demon who by force enjoyed all the offerings of the śrāddha ceremonies performed by our sons and grandsons on the anniversaries of our death and who drank the water with sesame seeds offered in holy places of pilgrimage. By killing this demon, O Lord, You have taken back all this stolen property from his abdomen by piercing it with Your nails. We therefore wish to offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

Yet Hiraṇyakaśipu was so dishonest that by the strength of his power and austerity, he took away our powers. Thus he became very proud of his mystic strength. Now, because this rogue has been killed by Your nails, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

śrī-vidyādharā ūcuḥ

Now the Supreme Personality of Godhead has killed him just as if the demon were an animal. Unto that supreme pastime form of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, we eternally offer our respectful obeisances.

O Lord, now that You have killed this great demon, we are in our normal condition. Kindly order us, Your eternal servants, what to do now.

We understand that his having now been killed is Your special mercy upon him.

etad ya ādi-puruṣasya mṛgendra-līlāṁ
daityendra-yūtha-pa-vadhaṁ prayataḥ paṭheta
daityātmajasya ca satāṁ pravarasya puṇyaṁ
śrutvānubhāvam akuto-bhayam eti lokam
etat—this narration; yaḥ—anyone who; ādi-puruṣasya—of the original Personality of Godhead; mṛga-indra-līlām—pastimes as a lion and human being combined; daitya-indra—of the king of the demons; yūtha-pa—as strong as an elephant; vadham—the killing; prayataḥ—with great attention; paṭheta—reads; daitya-ātma-jasya—of Prahlāda Mahārāja, the son of the demon; ca—also; satām—among elevated devotees; pravarasya—the best; puṇyam—pious; śrutvā—hearing; anubhāvam—the activities; akutaḥ-bhayam—where there is no fear anywhere or at any time; eti—reaches; lokam—the spiritual world.
Prahlāda Mahārāja was the best among exalted devotees. Anyone who with great attention hears this narration concerning the activities of Prahlāda Mahārāja, the killing of Hiraṇyakaśipu, and the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nṛsiṁhadeva, surely reaches the spiritual world, where there is no anxiety.

yūyaṁ nṛ-loke bata bhūri-bhāgā
lokaṁ punānā munayo 'bhiyanti
yeṣāṁ gṛhān āvasatīti sākṣād
gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣya-liṅgam
yūyam—all of you (the Pāṇḍavas); nṛ-loke—within this material world; bata—however; bhūri-bhāgāḥ—extremely fortunate; lokam—all the planets; punānāḥ—who can purify; munayaḥ—great saintly persons; abhiyanti—almost always come to visit; yeṣām—of whom; gṛhān—the house; āvasati—resides in; iti—thus; sākṣāt—directly; gūḍham—very confidential; param brahma—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; manuṣya-liṅgam—appearing just like a human being.
Nārada Muni continued: My dear Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, all of you [the Pāṇḍavas] are extremely fortunate, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, lives in your palace just like a human being. Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house.

sa vā ayaṁ brahma mahad-vimṛgya-
kaivalya-nirvāṇa-sukhānubhūtiḥ
priyaḥ suhṛd vaḥ khalu mātuleya
ātmārhaṇīyo vidhi-kṛd guruś ca
saḥ—that (Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa); vā—also; ayam—this; brahma—the impersonal Brahman (which is an emanation from Kṛṣṇa); mahat—by great personalities; vimṛgya—searched for; kaivalya—oneness; nirvāṇa-sukha—of transcendental happiness; anubhūtiḥ—the source of practical experience; priyaḥ—very, very dear; suhṛt—well-wisher; vaḥ—of you; khalu—indeed; mātuleyaḥ—the son of a maternal uncle; ātmā—exactly like body and soul together; arhaṇīyaḥ—worshipable (because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead); vidhi-kṛt—(yet He serves you as) an order carrier; guruḥ—your supreme advisor; ca—as well.
The impersonal Brahman is Kṛṣṇa Himself because Kṛṣṇa is the source of the impersonal Brahman. He is the origin of the transcendental bliss sought by great saintly persons, yet He, the Supreme Person, is your most dear friend and constant well-wisher and is intimately related to you as the son of your maternal uncle. Indeed, He is always like your body and soul. He is worshipable, yet He acts as your servant and sometimes as your spiritual master.

na—not; yasya—of whom; sākṣāt—directly; bhava—Lord Śiva; padma-ja—Lord Brahmā (born from the lotus); ādibhiḥ—by them and others also; rūpam—the form; dhiyā—even by meditation; vastutayā—fundamentally; upavarṇitam—described and perceived; maunena—by samādhi, deep meditation; bhaktyā—by devotional service; upaśamena—by renunciation; pūjitaḥ—worshiped; prasīdatām—may He be pleased; eṣaḥ—this; saḥ—He; sātvatām—of the great devotees; patiḥ—the master.
Exalted persons like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā could not properly describe the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. May the Lord, who is always worshiped as the protector of all devotees by great saints who observe vows of silence, meditation, devotional service and renunciation, be pleased with us.

śrī-prahrāda uvāca
mā māṁ pralobhayotpattyā
saktaṁkāmeṣu tair varaiḥ
tat-saṅga-bhīto nirviṇṇo
mumukṣus tvām upāśritaḥ

śrī-prahrādaḥ uvāca—Prahlāda Mahārāja said (to the Supreme Personality of Godhead); mā—please do not; mām—me; pralobhaya—allure; utpattyā—because of my birth (in a demoniac family); saktam—(I am already) attached; kāmeṣu—to material enjoyment; taiḥ—by all those; varaiḥ—benedictions of material possessions; tat-saṅga-bhītaḥ—being afraid of such material association; nirviṇṇaḥ—completely detached from material desires; mumukṣuḥ—desiring to be liberated from material conditions of life; tvām—unto Your lotus feet; upāśritaḥ—I have taken shelter.

Prahlāda Mahārāja said: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because I was born in an atheistic family I am naturally attached to material enjoyment. Therefore, kindly do not tempt me with these illusions. I am very much afraid of material conditions, and I desire to be liberated from materialistic life. It is for this reason that I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.

bhṛtya-lakṣaṇa-jijñāsur
bhaktaṁ kāmeṣv acodayat
bhavān saṁsāra-bījeṣu
hṛdaya-granthiṣu prabho

bhṛtya-lakṣaṇa-jijñāsuḥ—desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee; bhaktam—the devotee; kāmeṣu—in the material world, where lusty desires predominate; acodayat—has sent; bhavān—Your Lordship; saṁsāra-bījeṣu—the root cause of being present in this material world; hṛdaya-granthiṣu—which (desire for material enjoyment) is in the cores of the hearts of all conditioned souls; prabho—O my worshipable Lord.

O my worshipable Lord, because the seed of lusty desires, which is the root cause of material existence, is within the core of everyone's heart, You have sent me to this material world to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee.
Text
nānyathā te 'khila-guro
ghaṭeta karuṇātmanaḥ
yas ta āśiṣa āśāste
na sa bhṛtyaḥ sa vai vaṇik

na—not; anyathā—otherwise; te—of You; akhila-guro—O supreme instructor of the entire creation; ghaṭeta—such a thing can happen; karuṇā-ātmanaḥ—the Supreme Person, who is extremely kind to His devotees; yaḥ—any person who; te—from You; āśiṣaḥ—material benefits; āśāste—desires (in exchange for serving You); na—not; saḥ—such a person; bhṛtyaḥ—a servitor; saḥ—such a person; vai—indeed; vaṇik—a merchant (who wants to get material profit from his business).

Otherwise, O my Lord, O supreme instructor of the entire world, You are so kind to Your devotee that You could not induce him to do something unbeneficial for him. On the other hand, one who desires some material benefit in exchange for devotional service cannot be Your pure devotee. Indeed, he is no better than a merchant who wants profit in exchange for service.

āśāsāno na vai bhṛtyaḥ
svāminy āśiṣa ātmanaḥ
na svāmī bhṛtyataḥ svāmyam
icchan yo rāti cāśiṣaḥ

āśāsānaḥ—a person who desires (in exchange for service); na—not; vai—indeed; bhṛtyaḥ—a qualified servant or pure devotee of the Lord; svāmini—from the master; āśiṣaḥ—material benefit; ātmanaḥ—for personal sense gratification; na—nor; svāmī—the master; bhṛtyataḥ—from the servant; svāmyam—the prestigious position of being the master; icchan—desiring; yaḥ—any such master who; rāti—bestows; ca—also; āśiṣaḥ—material profit.

A servant who desires material profits from his master is certainly not a qualified servant or pure devotee. Similarly, a master who bestows benedictions upon his servant because of a desire to maintain a prestigious position as master is also not a pure master.
Text
ahaṁ tv akāmas tvad-bhaktas
tvaṁ ca svāmy anapāśrayaḥ
nānyathehāvayor artho

aham—as far as I am concerned; tu—indeed; akāmaḥ—without material desire; tvat-bhaktaḥ—fully attached to You without motivation; tvam ca—Your Lordship also; svāmī—the real master; anapāśrayaḥ—without motivation (You do not become the master with motivation); na—not; anyathā—without being in such a relationship as master and servant; iha—here; āvayoḥ—our; arthaḥ—any motivation (the Lord is the pure master, and Prahlāda Mahārāja is the pure devotee with no materialistic motivation); rāja—of a king; sevakayoḥ—and the servitor; iva—like (just as a king exacts taxes for the benefit of the servant or the citizens pay taxes for the benefit of the king).

O my Lord, I am Your unmotivated servant, and You are my eternal master. There is no need of our being anything other than master and servant. You are naturally my master, and I am naturally Your servant. We have no other relationship.

yadi dāsyasi me kāmān
varāṁs tvaṁ varadarṣabha

yadi—if; dāsyasi—want to give; me—me; kāmān—anything desirable; varān—as Your benediction; tvam—You; varada-ṛṣabha—O Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can give any benediction; kāmānām—of all desires for material happiness; hṛdi—within the core of my heart; asaṁroham—no growth; bhava taḥ—from You; tu—then; vṛṇe—I pray for; varam—such a benediction.

O my Lord, best of the givers of benediction, if You at all want to bestow a desirable benediction upon me, then I pray from Your Lordship that within the core of my heart there be no material desires.

indriyāṇi manaḥ prāṇa
ātmā dharmo dhṛtir matiḥ
hrīḥ śrīs tejaḥ smṛtiḥ satyaṁ

indriyāṇi—the senses; manaḥ—the mind; prāṇaḥ—the life air; ātmā—the body; dharmaḥ—religion; dhṛtiḥ—patience; matiḥ—intelligence; hrīḥ—shyness; śrīḥ—opulence; tejaḥ—strength; smṛtiḥ—memory; satyam—truthfulness; yasya—of which lusty desires; naśyanti—are vanquished; janmanā—from the very beginning of birth.

O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one's birth, the functions of one's senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience, intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are vanquished.
Text
vimuñcati yadā kāmān

vimuñcati—gives up; yadā—whenever; kāmān—all material desires; mānavaḥ—human society; manasi—within the mind; sthitān—situated; tarhi—at that time only; eva—indeed; puṇḍarīka-akṣa—O lotus-eyed Lord; bhagavattvāya—to be equally as opulent as the Lord; kalpate—becomes eligible.

O my Lord, when a human being is able to give up all the material desires in his mind, he becomes eligible to possess wealth and opulence like Yours.

oṁ namo bhagavate tubhyaṁ

oṁ—O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead; namaḥ—I offer my respectful obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Person; tubhyam—unto You; puruṣāya—unto the Supreme Person; mahā-ātmane—unto the Supreme Soul, or the Supersoul; haraye—unto the Lord, who vanquishes all the miseries of devotees; adbhuta-siṁhāya—unto Your wonderful lionlike form as Nṛsiṁhadeva; brahmaṇe—unto the Supreme Brahman; parama-ātmane—unto the Supreme Soul.

O my Lord, full of six opulences, O Supreme Person! O Supreme Soul, killer of all miseries! O Supreme Person in the form of a wonderful lion and man, let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

śrī-manur uvāca
yena cetayate viśvaṁ
viśvaṁ cetayate na yam
yo jāgarti śayāne 'smin
nāyaṁ taṁ veda veda saḥ
śrī-manuḥ uvāca—Svāyambhuva Manu chanted; yena—by whom (the Personality of Godhead); cetayate—is brought into animation; viśvam—the whole universe; viśvam—the whole universe (the material world); cetayate—animates; na—not; yam—He whom; yaḥ—He who; jāgarti—is always awake (watching all activities); śayāne—while sleeping; asmin—in this body; na—not; ayam—this living entity; tam—Him; veda—knows; veda—knows; saḥ—He.
Lord Manu said: The supreme living being has created this material world of animation; it is not that He was created by this material world. When everything is silent, the Supreme Being stays awake as a witness. The living entity does not know Him, but He knows everything.
Text 10
ātmāvāsyam idaṁ viśvaṁ
yat kiñcij jagatyāṁ jagat
tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā
mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam
ātma—the Supersoul; āvāsyam—living everywhere; idam—this universe; viśvam—all universes, all places; yat—whatever; kiñcit—everything that exists; jagatyām—in this world, everywhere; jagat—everything, animate and inanimate; tena—by Him; tyaktena—allotted; bhuñjīthāḥ—you may enjoy; mā—do not; gṛdhaḥ—accept; kasya svit—of anyone else; dhanam—the property.
Within this universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature is present everywhere, wherever there are animate or inanimate beings. Therefore, one should accept only that which is allotted to him; one should not desire to infringe upon the property of others.
Text 11
yaṁ paśyati na paśyantaṁ
cakṣur yasya na riṣyati
taṁ bhūta-nilayaṁ devaṁ
suparṇam upadhāvata
yam—He who; paśyati—the living entity sees; na—not; paśyantam—although always seeing; cakṣuḥ—eye; yasya—whose; na—never; riṣyati—diminishes; tam—Him; bhūta-nilayam—the original source of all living entities; devam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; suparṇam—who accompanies the living entity as a friend; upadhāvata—everyone should worship.
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly watches the activities of the world, no one sees Him. However, one should not think that because no one sees Him, He does not see, for His power to see is never diminished. Therefore, everyone should worship the Supersoul, who always stays with the individual soul as a friend.
Text 12
na yasyādy-antau madhyaṁ ca
svaḥ paro nāntaraṁ bahiḥ
viśvasyāmūni yad yasmād
viśvaṁ ca tad ṛtaṁ mahat
na—neither; yasya—of whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); ādi—a beginning; antau—end; madhyam—middle; ca—also; svaḥ—own; paraḥ—others; na—nor; antaram—inside; bahiḥ—outside; viśvasya—of the whole cosmic manifestation; amūni—all such considerations; yat—whose form; yasmāt—from Him who is the cause of everything; viśvam—the whole universe; ca—and; tat—all of them; ṛtam—truth; mahat—very, very great.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning, no end and no middle. Nor does He belong to a particular person or nation. He has no inside or outside. The dualities found within this material world, such as beginning and end, mine and theirs, are all absent from the personality of the Supreme Lord. The universe, which emanates from Him, is another feature of the Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate truth, and He is complete in greatness.
Text 13
sa viśva-kāyaḥ puru-hūta-īśaḥ
satyaḥ svayaṁ-jyotir ajaḥ purāṇaḥ
dhatte 'sya janmādy-ajayātma-śaktyā
tāṁ vidyayodasya nirīha āste
saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; viśva-kāyaḥ—the total form of the universe (the whole universe is the external body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead); puru-hūtaḥ—known by so many names; īśaḥ—the supreme controller (with full power); satyaḥ—the ultimate truth; svayam—personally; jyotiḥ—self-effulgent; ajaḥ—unborn, beginningless; purāṇaḥ—the oldest; dhatte—He performs; asya—of this universe; janma-ādi—the creation, maintenance and annihilation; ajayā—by His external energy; ātma-śaktyā—by His personal potency; tām—that external material energy; vidyayā—by His spiritual potency; udasya—giving up; nirīhaḥ—without any desire or activity; āste—He is existing (untouched by the material energy).
The entire cosmic manifestation is the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, who has millions of names and unlimited potencies. He is self-effulgent, unborn and changeless. He is the beginning of everything, but He has no beginning. Because He has created this cosmic manifestation by His external energy, the universe appears to be created, maintained and annihilated by Him. Nonetheless, He remains materially inactive—situated in His spiritual energy and untouched by the activities of the material energy.
Text 14
athāgre ṛṣayaḥ karmāṇ-
īhante 'karma-hetave

atha—therefore; agre—in the beginning; ṛṣayaḥ—all learned ṛṣis, saintly persons; karmāṇi—fruitive activities; īhante—execute; akarma—freedom from fruitive results; hetave—for the purpose of; īhamānaḥ—engaging in such activities; hi—indeed; puruṣaḥ—a person; prāyaḥ—almost always; anīhām—liberation from karma; prapadyate—attains.
Therefore, to enable people to reach the stage of activities that are not tinged by fruitive results, great saints first engage people in fruitive activities, for unless one begins by performing activities as recommended in the śāstras, one cannot reach the stage of liberation, or activities that produce no reactions.
Text 15
īhate bhagavān īśo
na hi tatra visajjate
ātma-lābhena pūrṇārtho
nāvasīdanti ye 'nu tam
īhate—engages in activities of creation, maintenance and annihilation; bhagavān—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa; īśaḥ—the supreme controller; na—not; hi—indeed; tatra—in such activities; visajjate—He becomes entangled; ātma-lābhena—because of His own gain; pūrṇa-arthaḥ—who is self-satisfied; na—not; avasīdanti—are disheartened; ye—persons who; anu—follow; tam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in opulence by His own gain, yet He acts as the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world. In spite of acting in that way, He is never entangled. Hence devotees who follow in His footsteps are also never entangled.
Text 16

nirāśiṣaṁ pūrṇam ananya-coditam

tam—unto the same Supreme Personality of Godhead; īhamānam—who is acting for our benefit; nirahaṅkṛtam—who is without entanglement or desire for gain; budham—who is completely in knowledge; nirāśiṣam—without desires to enjoy the fruits of His activities; pūrṇam—who is full and therefore has no need to fulfill desires; ananya—by others; coditam—induced or inspired; nṝn—all of human society; śikṣayantam—to teach (the real path of life); nija-vartma—His own personal way of life; saṁsthitam—to establish (without deviation); prabhum—unto the Supreme Lord; prapadye—I request everyone to surrender; akhila-dharma-bhāvanam—who is the master of all religious principles or the occupational duties for a human being.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, works just like an ordinary human being, yet He does not desire to enjoy the fruits of work. He is full in knowledge, free from material desires and diversions, and completely independent. As the supreme teacher of human society, He teaches His own way of activities, and thus He inaugurates the real path of religion. I request everyone to follow Him.

śrī-gajendra uvāca
oṁ namo bhagavate tasmai
yata etac cid-ātmakam
puruṣāyādi-bījāya

śrī-gajendraḥ uvāca—Gajendra, the king of elephants, said; oṁ—O my Lord; namaḥ—I offer my respectful obeisances unto You; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tasmai—unto Him; yataḥ—from whom; etat—this body and the material manifestation; cit-ātmakam—is moving due to consciousness (the spirit soul); puruṣāya—unto the Supreme Person; ādi-bījāya—who is the origin or root cause of everything; para-īśāya—who is supreme, transcendental and worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahmā and Śiva; abhidhīmahi—let me meditate upon Him.
The king of the elephants, Gajendra, said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, Vāsudeva [oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya]. Because of Him this material body acts due to the presence of spirit, and He is therefore the root cause of everyone. He is worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahmā and Śiva, and He has entered the heart of every living being. Let me meditate upon Him.

yasminn idaṁ yataś cedaṁ
yenedaṁ ya idaṁ svayam

yasmin—the basic platform on which; idam—the universe rests; yataḥ—the ingredients from which; ca—and; idam—the cosmic manifestation is produced; yena—by whom; idam—this cosmic manifestation is created and maintained; yaḥ—He who; idam—this material world; svayam—is Himself; yaḥ—He who; asmāt—from the effect (this material world); parasmāt—from the cause; ca—and; paraḥ—transcendental or different; tam—unto Him; prapadye—I surrender; svayambhuvam—unto the supreme self-sufficient.
The Supreme Godhead is the supreme platform on which everything rests, the ingredient by which everything has been produced, and the person who has created and is the only cause of this cosmic manifestation. Nonetheless, He is different from the cause and the result. I surrender unto Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is self-sufficient in everything.

kvacid vibhātaṁ kva ca tat tirohitam

yaḥ—the Supreme Personality of Godhead who; sva-ātmani—in Him; idam—this cosmic manifestation; nija-māyayā—by His own potency; arpitam—invested; kvacit—sometimes, at the beginning of a kalpa; vibhātam—it is manifested; kva ca—sometimes, during dissolution; tat—that (manifestation); tirohitam—not visible; aviddha-dṛk—He sees everything (in all these circumstances); sākṣī—the witness; ubhayam—both (manifestation and annihilation); tat īkṣate—sees everything, without loss of sight; saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; ātma-mūlaḥ—self-sufficient, having no other cause; avatu—please give protection; mām—unto me; parāt-paraḥ—He is transcendental to transcendental, or above all transcendence.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by expanding His own energy, keeps this cosmic manifestation visible and again sometimes renders it invisible. He is both the supreme cause and the supreme result, the observer and the witness, in all circumstances. Thus He is transcendental to everything. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead give me protection.

kālena—in due course of time (after millions and millions of years); pañcatvam—when everything illusory is annihilated; iteṣu—all transformations; kṛtsnaśaḥ—with everything within this cosmic manifestation; lokeṣu—all the planets, or everything that exists; pāleṣu—maintainers like Lord Brahmā; ca—also; sarva-hetuṣu—all causative existences; tamaḥ—great darkness; tadā—then; āsīt—was; gahanam—very dense; gabhīram—very deep; yaḥ—the Supreme Personality of Godhead who; tasya—this dark situation; pāre—over and above; abhivirājate—exists or shines; vibhuḥ—the Supreme.
In due course of time, when all the causative and effective manifestations of the universe, including the planets and their directors and maintainers, are annihilated, there is a situation of dense darkness. Above this darkness, however, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I take shelter of His lotus feet.

An artist onstage, being covered by attractive dresses and dancing with different movements, is not understood by his audience; similarly, the activities and features of the supreme artist cannot be understood even by the demigods or great sages, and certainly not by those who are unintelligent like animals. Neither the demigods and sages nor the unintelligent can understand the features of the Lord, nor can they express in words His actual position. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead give me protection.

Renunciants and great sages who see all living beings equally, who are friendly to everyone and who flawlessly practice in the forest the vows of brahmacarya, vānaprastha and sannyāsa desire to see the all-auspicious lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. May that same Supreme Personality of Godhead be my destination.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material birth, activities, name, form, qualities or faults. To fulfill the purpose for which this material world is created and destroyed, He comes in the form of a human being like Lord Rāma or Lord Kṛṣṇa by His original internal potency. He has immense potency, and in various forms, all free from material contamination, He acts wonderfully. He is therefore the Supreme Brahman. I offer my respects to Him.

I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has no material qualities but who accepts the three qualities goodness, passion and ignorance within this material world. I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman effulgence.

You are the Supreme Person, the origin of material nature and of the total material energy. You are also the owner of the material body. Therefore, You are the supreme complete. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, You are the observer of all the objectives of the senses. Without Your mercy, there is no possibility of solving the problem of doubts. The material world is just like a shadow resembling You. Indeed, one accepts this material world as real because it gives a glimpse of Your existence.

Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, as the fire in araṇi wood is covered, You and Your unlimited knowledge are covered by the material modes of nature. Your mind, however, is not attentive to the activities of the modes of nature. Those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge are not subject to the regulative principles directed in the Vedic literatures. Because such advanced souls are transcendental, You personally appear in their pure minds. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Indeed, being extremely merciful, You incessantly try to deliver me. By your partial feature as Paramātmā, You are situated in the hearts of all embodied beings. You are celebrated as direct transcendental knowledge, and You are unlimited. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My Lord, those who are completely freed from material contamination always meditate upon You within the cores of their hearts.

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, uncontaminated by the modes of nature. You are the reservoir of all enlightenment, the supreme controller. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

After worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, those who are interested in the four principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation obtain from Him what they desire. What then is to be said of other benedictions? Indeed, sometimes the Lord gives a spiritual body to such ambitious worshipers. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unlimitedly merciful, bestow upon me the benediction of liberation from this present danger and from the materialistic way of life.

Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious. Thus they always merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. Such devotees never ask the Lord for any benediction. I, however, am in danger. Thus I pray to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally existing, who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahmā, and who is available only by transcendental bhakti-yoga. Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and transcendental to all external realization. He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely full in everything. I offer my obeisances unto Him.

yasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who; brahma-ādayaḥ—the great demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā; devāḥ—and other demigods; vedāḥ—the Vedic knowledge; lokāḥ—different personalities; cara-acarāḥ—the moving and the nonmoving (like trees and plants); nāma-rūpa—of different names and different forms; vibhedena—by such divisions; phalgvyā—who are less important; ca—also; kalayā—by the parts; kṛtāḥ—created; yathā—as; arciṣaḥ—the sparks; agneḥ—of fire; savituḥ—from the sun; gabhastayaḥ—the shining particles; niryānti—emanate from; saṁyānti—and enter into; asakṛt—again and again; sva-rociṣaḥ—as parts and parcels; tathā—similarly; yataḥ—the Personality of Godhead from whom; ayam—this; guṇa-sampravāhaḥ—continuous manifestation of the different modes of nature; buddhiḥ manaḥ—the intelligence and mind; khāni—the senses; śarīra—of the body (gross and subtle); sargāḥ—the divisions; saḥ—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; vai—indeed; na—is not; deva—demigod; asura—demon; martya—human being; tiryak—bird or beast; na—neither; strī—woman; na—nor; ṣaṇḍhaḥ—neuter; na—neither; pumān—man; na—nor; jantuḥ—living being or animal; na ayam—nor is He; guṇaḥ—material quality; karma—fruitive activity; na—is not; sat—manifestation; na—nor; ca—also; asat—nonmanifestation; niṣedha—of the discrimination of neti neti ("not this, not this"); śeṣaḥ—He is the end; jayatāt—all glories unto Him; aśeṣaḥ—who is unlimited.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates His minor parts and parcels, the jīva-tattva, beginning with Lord Brahmā, the demigods and the expansions of Vedic knowledge [Sāma, Ṛg, Yajur and Atharva] and including all other living entities, moving and nonmoving, with their different names and characteristics. As the sparks of a fire or the shining rays of the sun emanate from their source and merge into it again and again, the mind, the intelligence, the senses, the gross and subtle material bodies, and the continuous transformations of the different modes of nature all emanate from the Lord and again merge into Him. He is neither demigod nor demon, neither human nor bird or beast. He is not woman, man, or neuter, nor is He an animal. He is not a material quality, a fruitive activity, a manifestation or nonmanifestation. He is the last word in the discrimination of "not this, not this," and He is unlimited. All glories to the Supreme Personality of Godhead!

You have no material qualities. Indeed, You are inconceivable. The mind cannot catch You by speculation, and words fail to describe You. You are the supreme master of everyone, and therefore You are worshipable for everyone. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

He is the illuminator of everything and has no ignorance. He does not have a material body subject to the reactions of previous activities, and He is free from the ignorance of partiality and materialistic education. I therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, who is eternal, all-pervading and as great as the sky and who appears with six opulences in three yugas [Satya, Tretā and Dvāpara].

tri-nābhi vidyuc-calam aṣṭa-nemi

ajasya—of the living being; cakram—the wheel (the cycle of birth and death in this material world); tu—but; ajayā—by the external energy of the Supreme Lord; īryamāṇam—going around with great force; manaḥ-mayam—which is nothing but a mental creation depending chiefly on the mind; pañcadaśa—fifteen; aram—possessing spokes; āśu—very quick; tri-nābhi—having three naves (the three modes of material nature); vidyut—like electricity; calam—moving; aṣṭa-nemi—made of eight fellies (the eight external energies of the Lord—bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ, etc.); yat—who; akṣam—the hub; āhuḥ—they say; tam—unto Him; ṛtam—the fact; prapadye—let us offer our respectful obeisances.
In the cycle of material activities, the material body resembles the wheel of a mental chariot. The ten senses [five for working and five for gathering knowledge] and the five life airs within the body form the fifteen spokes of the chariot's wheel. The three modes of nature [goodness, passion and ignorance] are its center of activities, and the eight ingredients of nature [earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego] comprise the rim of the wheel. The external, material energy moves this wheel like electrical energy. Thus the wheel revolves very quickly around its hub or central support, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul and the ultimate truth. We offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in pure goodness [śuddha-sattva], and therefore He is eka-varṇa—the oṁkāra [praṇava]. Because the Lord is beyond the cosmic manifestation, which is considered to be darkness, He is not visible to material eyes. Nonetheless, He is not separated from us by time or space, but is present everywhere. Seated on His carrier, Garuḍa, He is worshiped by means of mystical yogic power by those who have achieved freedom from agitation. Let us all offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

My Lord, we, the various demigods, the directors of this universe, have come to Your lotus feet. Please fulfill the purpose for which we have come. You are the witness of everything, from within and without. Nothing is unknown to You, and therefore it is unnecessary to inform You again of anything.

O lord, you are the cause of bondage and liberation of the entire universe because you are its ruler. Those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness surrender unto you, and therefore you are the cause of mitigating their distresses, and you are also the cause of their liberation. We therefore worship Your Lordship.

O lord, your shadow is seen in irreligion, which brings about varieties of irreligious creations. The three modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—are your three eyes. All the Vedic literatures, which are full of verses, are emanations from you because their compilers wrote the various scriptures after receiving your glance.

O Lord Girīśa, since the impersonal Brahman effulgence is transcendental to the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, the various directors of this material world certainly cannot appreciate it or even know where it is. It is not understandable even to Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu or the king of heaven, Mahendra.

What then is to be said of your destroying the Dakṣa-yajña, Tripurāsura and the kālakūṭa poison? Such activities cannot be subject matters for prayers offered to you.

Exalted, self-satisfied persons who preach to the entire world think of your lotus feet constantly within their hearts. However, when persons who do not know your austerity see you moving with Umā, they misunderstand you to be lusty, or when they see you wandering in the crematorium they mistakenly think that you are ferocious and envious. Certainly they are shameless. They cannot understand your activities.

Even personalities like Lord Brahmā and other demigods cannot understand your position, for you are beyond the moving and nonmoving creation. Since no one can understand you in truth, how can one offer you prayers? It is impossible. As far as we are concerned, we are creatures of Lord Brahmā's creation. Under the circumstances, therefore, we cannot offer you adequate prayers, but as far as our ability allows, we have expressed our feelings.

O greatest of all rulers, your actual identity is impossible for us to understand. As far as we can see, your presence brings flourishing happiness to everyone. Beyond this, no one can appreciate your activities. We can see this much, and nothing more.

You are the root and efficient cause of everything. You are not material. Indeed, You are the Supersoul or supreme living force of everything. Therefore, You are Parameśvara, the supreme controller of all controllers.

My Lord, You are the Supreme Brahman, complete in everything. Being completely spiritual, You are eternal, free from the material modes of nature, and full of transcendental bliss. Indeed, for You there is no question of lamentation. Since You are the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, nothing can exist without You. Yet we are different from You in a relationship of cause and effect, for in one sense the cause and effect are different. You are the original cause of creation, manifestation and annihilation, and You bestow benedictions upon all living entities. Everyone depends upon You for the results of his activities, but You are always independent.

My dear Lord, Your Lordship alone is the cause and the effect. Therefore, although You appear to be two, You are the absolute one. As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same. Only because of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities. You are free from material contamination, and since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your transcendental qualities. Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be maintained.

Those who are known as the impersonalist Vedāntists regard You as the impersonal Brahman. Others, known as the Mīmāṁsaka philosophers, regard You as religion. The Sāṅkhya philosophers regard You as the transcendental person who is beyond prakṛti and puruṣa and who is the controller of even the demigods. The followers of the codes of devotional service known as the Pañcarātras regard You as being endowed with nine different potencies. And the Patañjala philosophers, the followers of Patañjali Muni, regard You as the supreme independent Personality of Godhead, who has no equal or superior.

O my Lord, I, who am considered to be the best of the demigods, and Lord Brahmā and the great ṛṣis, headed by Marīci, are born of the mode of goodness. Nonetheless, we are bewildered by Your illusory energy and cannot understand what this creation is. Aside from us, what is to be said of others, like the demons and human beings, who are in the base modes of material nature [rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa]? How will they know You?

As the air enters the vast sky and also enters the bodies of all moving and nonmoving entities, You are present everywhere, and therefore You are the knower of all.

What is the use of the material body, which automatically leaves its owner at the end of life? And what is the use of all one's family members, who are actually plunderers taking away money that is useful for the service of the Lord in spiritual opulence? What is the use of a wife? She is only the source of increasing material conditions. And what is the use of family, home, country and community? Attachment for them merely wastes the valuable energy of one's lifetime.

Being fully convinced of the substantiality afforded by shelter at Your lotus feet, He took shelter of Your lotus feet, against the will of his father and demoniac friends, who were killed by Your own self.

In such a condition, what good can they do for You, who are the independent creator, maintainer and annihilator of this universe?

As the Supersoul of all living entities, You are aware of everything, and therefore You are certainly equal toward everyone. Nonetheless, You favor Your devotees. This is not partiality, however, for Your characteristic is just like that of a desire tree, which yields everything according to one's desire.

Aṁśumān said: My Lord, even Lord Brahmā is to this very day unable to understand Your position, which is far beyond himself, either by meditation or by mental speculation. So what to speak of others like us, who have been created by Brahmā in various forms as demigods, animals, human beings, birds and beasts? We are completely in ignorance. Therefore, how can we know You, who are the Transcendence?

My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone's heart, but the living entities, covered by the material body, cannot see You, for they are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three modes of material nature. Their intelligence being covered by sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa, they can see only the actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature. Because of the actions and reactions of the mode of ignorance, whether the living entities are awake or sleeping, they can see only the workings of material nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.

O completely peaceful Lord, although material nature, fruitive activities and their consequent material names and forms are Your creation, You are unaffected by them. Therefore, Your transcendental name is different from material names, and Your form is different from material forms. You assume a form resembling a material body just to give us instructions like those of Bhagavad-gītā, but actually You are the supreme original person. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

satya-vratam—the Personality of Godhead, who never deviates from His vow *; satya-param—who is the Absolute Truth (as stated in the beginning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi); tri-satyam—He is always present as the Absolute Truth, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, during its maintenance, and even after its annihilation; satyasya—of all relative truths, which are emanations from the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa; yonim—the cause; nihitam—entered *; ca—and; satye—in the factors that create this material world (namely, the five elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether); satyasya—of all that is accepted as the truth; satyam—the Lord is the original truth; ṛta-satya-netram—He is the origin of whatever truth is pleasing (sunetram); satya-ātmakam—everything pertaining to the Lord is truth (sac-cid-ānanda: His body is truth, His knowledge is truth, and His pleasure is truth); tvām—unto you, O Lord; śaraṇam—offering our full surrender; prapannāḥ—we are completely under Your protection.
The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic manifestation—creation, maintenance and annihilation—You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antaryāmī, the inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.

ekāyano 'sau dvi-phalas tri-mūlaś
catū-rasaḥ paṣca-vidhaḥ ṣaḍ-ātmā
sapta-tvag aṣṭa-viṭapo navākṣo
daśa-cchadī dvi-khago hy ādi-vṛkṣaḥ
eka-ayanaḥ—the body of an ordinary living being is fully dependent on the material elements; asau—that; dvi-phalaḥ—in this body we are subject to material happiness and distress, which result from karma; tri-mūlaḥ—having three roots, the three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), upon which the body is created;  catuḥ-rasaḥ—four rasas, or tastes; paṣca-vidhaḥ—consisting of five senses for acquiring knowledge (the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch); ṣaṭ-ātmā—six circumstances (lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst); sapta-tvak—having seven coverings (skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen); aṣṭa-viṭapaḥ—eight branches (the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and also the mind, intelligence and ego); nava-akṣaḥ—nine holes; daśa-chadī—ten kinds of life air, resembling the leaves of a tree; dvi-khagaḥ—two birds (the individual soul and the Supersoul); hi—indeed; ādi-vṛkṣaḥ -this is the original tree or construction of the material body, whether individual or universal.
The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called "the original tree." From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit—the enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association with the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four tastes—religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation—which are experienced through five senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements—earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows—the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the rectum and the genitals—and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.

tvam—You (O Lord); ekaḥ—being one without a second, You are everything; eva—indeed; asya sataḥ—of this cosmic manifestation now visible; prasūtiḥ—the original source; tvam—Your Lordship; sannidhānam—the conservation of all such energy when everything is annihilated; tvam—Your Lordship; anugrahaḥ ca—and the maintainer; tvat-māyayā—by Your illusory, external energy; saṁvṛta-cetasaḥ—those whose intelligence is covered by such illusory energy; tvām—unto You; paśyanti—observe; nānā—many varieties; na—not; vipaścitaḥ—learned scholars or devotees; ye—who are.
The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord. You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is not the vision of learned devotees.

bibharṣi—You accept; rūpāṇi—varieties of forms, such as Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Rāma and Nṛsiṁha; avabodhaḥ ātmā—in spite of having different incarnations, You remain the Supreme, full of knowledge; kṣemāya—for the benefit of everyone, and especially the devotees; lokasya—of all living entities; cara-acarasya—moving and nonmoving; sattva-upapannāni—all such incarnations are transcendental (śuddha-sattva); sukha-avahāni—full of transcendental bliss; satām—of the devotees; abhadrāṇi—all inauspiciousness or annihilation; muhuḥ—again and again; khalānām—of the nondevotees.
O Lord, You are always in full knowledge, and to bring all good fortune to all living entities, You appear in different incarnations, all of them transcendental to the material creation. When You appear in these incarnations, You are pleasing to the pious and religious devotees, but for nondevotees You are the annihilator.

tvayi—in You; ambuja-akṣa—O lotus-eyed Lord; akhila-sattva-dhāmni—who are the original cause of all existence, from whom everything emanates and in whom all potencies reside; samādhinā—by constant meditation and complete absorption (in thoughts of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead); āveśita—fully absorbed, fully engaged; cetasā—but by such a mentality; eke—the one process of always thinking of Your lotus feet; tvat-pāda-potena—by boarding such a boat as Your lotus feet; mahat-kṛtena—by that action which is considered the most powerful original existence or which is executed by mahājanas; kurvanti—they make; govatsa-padam—like the hoofprint of a calf; bhava-abdhim—the great ocean of nescience.
O lotus-eyed Lord, by concentrating one's meditation on Your lotus feet, which are the reservoir of all existence, and by accepting those lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of mahājanas [great saints, sages and devotees]. By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.

O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore You are known as a desire tree [vāṣchā-kalpataru]. When ācāryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.

[Someone may say that aside from devotees, who always seek shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, there are those who are not devotees but who have accepted different processes for attaining salvation. What happens to them? In answer to this question, Lord Brahmā and the other demigods said:] O lotus-eyed Lord, although nondevotees who accept severe austerities and penances to achieve the highest position may think themselves liberated, their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because they have no regard for Your lotus feet.

O Mādhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.

O Lord, during the time of maintenance You manifest several incarnations, all with transcendental bodies, beyond the material modes of nature. When You appear in this way, You bestow all good fortune upon the living entities by teaching them to perform Vedic activities such as ritualistic ceremonies, mystic yoga, austerities, penances, and ultimately samādhi, ecstatic absorption in thoughts of You. Thus You are worshiped by the Vedic principles.

O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.

Therefore Your appearance or birth in this world has no other cause than Your pleasure potency. Similarly, the living entities, who are part of You, have no cause for miseries like birth, death and old age, except when these living entities are conducted by Your external energy.

My Lord, You are the same person who in the beginning created this material world by His personal external energy. After the creation of this world of three guṇas [sattva, rajas and tamas], You appear to have entered it, although in fact You have not.

The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [jīva-bhūta], these separated energies combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the mind or words [avāṅ-mānasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses. Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never entered the womb of Devakī; rather, You existed there already.

One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in the soul, the visible body and senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it a reality.

O my Lord, learned Vedic scholars conclude that the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the entire cosmic manifestation are performed by You, who are free from endeavor, unaffected by the modes of material nature, and changeless in Your spiritual situation. There are no contradictions in You, who are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Para-brahman. Because the three modes of material nature-sattva, rajas and tamas—are under Your control, everything takes place automatically.

śrī-devaky uvāca
rūpaṁ yat tat prāhur avyaktam ādyaṁ
brahma jyotir nirguṇaṁ nirvikāram
sattā-mātraṁ nirviśeṣaṁ nirīhaṁ
sa tvaṁ sākṣād viṣṇur adhyātma-dīpaḥ
śrī-devakī uvāca—Śrī Devakī said; rūpam—form or substance; yat tat—because You are the same substance; prāhuḥ—You are sometimes called; avyaktam—not perceivable by the material senses (ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ); ādyam—You are the original cause; brahma—You are known as Brahman; jyotiḥ—light; nirguṇam—without material qualities; nirvikāram—without change, the same form of Viṣṇu perpetually; sattā-mātram—the original substance, the cause of everything; nirviśeṣam—You are present everywhere as the Supersoul (within the heart of a human being and within the heart of an animal, the same substance is present); nirīham—without material desires; saḥ—that Supreme Person; tvam—Your Lordship; sākṣāt—directly; viṣṇuḥ—Lord Viṣṇu; adhyātma-dīpaḥ—the light for all transcendental knowledge (knowing You, one knows everything: kasmin nu bhagavo vijṣāte sarvam idaṁ vijṣātaṁ bhavatīti).
Śrī Devakī said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Paramātmā, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Viṣṇu, the light of all transcendental knowledge.

After millions of years, at the time of cosmic annihilation, when everything, manifested and unmanifested, is annihilated by the force of time, the five gross elements enter into the subtle conception, and the manifested categories enter into the unmanifested substance. At that time, You alone remain, and You are known as Ananta Śeṣa-nāga.

Let me offer my full surrender unto Your Lordship.

tathā api—nevertheless; bhūman—O limitless one; mahimā—the potency; aguṇasya—of Him who has no material qualities; te—of You; viboddhum—to understand; arhati—one is able; amala—spotless; antaḥ-ātmabhiḥ—with mind and senses; avikriyāt—not based on material differentiations; sva-anubhavāt—by perception of the Supreme Soul; arūpataḥ—without attachment to material forms; hi—indeed; ananya-bodhya-ātmatayā—as self-manifested, without the help of any other illuminating agent; na—not; ca—and; anyathā—otherwise.
Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal feature. Nevertheless, it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.

guṇa-ātmanaḥ—of the possessor of all superior qualities; te—You; api—certainly; guṇān—the qualities; vimātum—to count; hita-avatīrṇasya—who have descended for the benefit of all living entities; ke—who; īśire—are able; asya—of the universe; kālena—in due course of time; yaiḥ—by whom; vā—or; vimitāḥ—counted; su-kalpaiḥ—by great scientists; bhū-pāṁśavaḥ—the atoms of an earthly planet; khe—in the sky; mihikāḥ—the particles of snow; dyu-bhāsaḥ—the illumination of stars and planets.
In time, learned philosophers or scientists might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the particles of snow, or perhaps even the shining molecules radiating from the sun, the stars and other luminaries. But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?

My dear Lord, one who earnestly waits for You to bestow Your causeless mercy upon him, all the while patiently suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds and offering You respectful obeisances with his heart, words and body, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.

My Lord, just see my uncivilized impudence! To test Your power I tried to extend my illusory potency to cover You, the unlimited and primeval Supersoul, who bewilder even the masters of illusion. What am I compared to You? I am just like a small spark in the presence of a great fire.

Therefore, O infallible Lord, kindly excuse my offenses. I have taken birth in the mode of passion and am therefore simply foolish, presuming myself a controller independent of Your Lordship. My eyes are blinded by the darkness of ignorance, which causes me to think of myself as the unborn creator of the universe. But please consider that I am Your servant and therefore worthy of Your compassion.

Unlimited universes pass through the pores of Your body just as particles of dust pass through the openings of a screened window.

My dear Lord, it is said that when the three planetary systems are merged into the water at the time of dissolution, Your plenary portion, Nārāyaṇa, lies down on the water, gradually a lotus flower grows from His navel, and Brahmā takes birth upon that lotus flower. Certainly, these words are not false. Thus am I not born from You?

Are You not the original Nārāyaṇa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Nārāyaṇa is Your expansion, and He is called Nārāyaṇa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Māyā.

My dear Lord, in this incarnation You have proved that You are the supreme controller of Māyā. Although You are now within this universe, the whole universal creation is within Your transcendental body—a fact You demonstrated by exhibiting the universe within Your abdomen before Your mother, Yaśodā.

Have You not shown me today that both You Yourself and everything within this creation are manifestations of Your inconceivable potency? First You appeared alone, and then You manifested Yourself as all of Vṛndāvana's calves and cowherd boys, Your friends. Next You appeared as an equal number of four-handed Viṣṇu forms, who were worshiped by all living beings, including me, and after that You appeared as an equal number of complete universes. Finally, You have now returned to Your unlimited form as the Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second.

Therefore this entire universe, which like a dream is by nature unreal, nevertheless appears real, and thus it covers one's consciousness and assails one with repeated miseries. This universe appears real because it is manifested by the potency of illusion emanating from You, whose unlimited transcendental forms are full of eternal happiness and knowledge.

A person who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful, but he then gives up his fear upon realizing that the so-called snake does not exist.

The conception of material bondage and the conception of liberation are both manifestations of ignorance. Being outside the scope of true knowledge, they cease to exist when one correctly understands that the pure spirit soul is distinct from matter and always fully conscious. At that time bondage and liberation no longer have any significance, just as day and night have no significance from the perspective of the sun.

Such fools conclude that the supreme soul is to be searched for somewhere outside Your supreme personality.

Yet even though the extent of the good fortune of these residents of Vṛndāvana is inconceivable, we eleven presiding deities of the various senses, headed by Lord Śiva, are also most fortunate, because the senses of these devotees of Vṛndāvana are the cups through which we repeatedly drink the nectarean, intoxicating beverage of the honey of Your lotus feet.

Their entire life and soul is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, the dust of whose lotus feet is still being searched for in the Vedic mantras.

My mind becomes bewildered just trying to think of what reward other than You could be found anywhere. You are the embodiment of all benedictions, which You bestow upon these residents of the cowherd community of Vṛndāvana. You have already arranged to give Yourself to Pūtanā and her family members in exchange for her disguising herself as a devotee. So what is left for You to give these devotees of Vṛndāvana, whose homes, wealth, friends, dear relations, bodies, children and very lives and hearts are all dedicated only to You?

As these two sons enter the forest, surrounded by Their friends, driving the cows before Them, They hold Their flutes to Their mouths and glance lovingly upon the residents of Vṛndāvana. For those who have eyes, we think there is no greater object of vision.

His mother, the river on whose bank the bamboo was born, feels jubilation, and therefore her blooming lotus flowers are standing like hair on her body.

We are ready to give up all material relationships.

The gopīs said: O gopīs, when Mukunda vibrates the flute He has placed to His lips, stopping its holes with His tender fingers, He rests His left cheek on His left arm and makes His eyebrows dance. At that time the demigoddesses traveling in the sky with their husbands, the Siddhas, become amazed. As those ladies listen, they are embarrassed to find their minds yielding to the pursuit of lusty desires, and in their distress they are unaware that the belts of their garments are loosening.

Stunned, they appear as if asleep, or like figures in a painting.

My dear gopī, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balarāma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.

Kṛṣṇa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kṛṣṇa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viṣṇu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.

O goddesses of Vraja, when Kṛṣṇa is enjoying Himself with Balarāma on the mountain slopes, playfully wearing a flower garland on the top of His head, He engladdens all with the resonant vibrations of His flute. Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend Kṛṣṇa and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.

O pious Mother Yaśodā, your son, who is expert in all the arts of herding cows, has invented many new styles of flute-playing. When He takes His flute to His bimba-red lips and sends forth the tones of the harmonic scale in variegated melodies, Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and other chief demigods become confused upon hearing the sound. Although they are the most learned authorities, they cannot ascertain the essence of that music, and thus they bow down their heads and hearts.

As Kṛṣṇa strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gopīs, who become agitated by Cupid when Kṛṣṇa playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.

Now Kṛṣṇa is standing somewhere counting His cows on a string of gems. He wears a garland of tulasī flowers that bear the fragrance of His beloved, and He has thrown His arm over the shoulder of an affectionate cowherd boyfriend. As Kṛṣṇa plays His flute and sings, the music attracts the black deer's wives, who approach that ocean of transcendental qualities and sit down beside Him. Just like us cowherd girls, they have given up all hope for happiness in family life.

The gentle breeze honors Him with its soothing fragrance of sandalwood, while the various Upadevas, standing on all sides like panegyrists, offer their music, singing and gifts of tribute.

Out of great affection for the cows of Vraja, Kṛṣṇa became the lifter of Govardhana Hill. At the end of the day, having rounded up all His own cows, He plays a song on His flute, while exalted demigods standing along the path worship His lotus feet and the cowherd boys accompanying Him chant His glories. His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Kṛṣṇa is the moon arisen from the womb of Mother Yaśodā.

He wears a flower garland, and the beauty of His soft cheeks is accentuated by the brilliance of His golden earrings and the whiteness of His face, which has the color of a badara berry. With His cheerful face resembling the moon, lord of the night, the Lord of the Yadus moves with the grace of a regal elephant. Thus He returns in the evening, delivering the cows of Vraja from the heat of the day.

Then, O Lord of the universe, in Dvārakā You will deliver King Nṛga from a curse and take for Yourself the Syamantaka jewel, together with another wife. You will bring back a brāhmaṇa's dead son from the abode of Your servant Yamarāja, and thereafter You will kill Pauṇḍraka, burn down the city of Kāśī and slay Dantavakra, and You will also put an end to the king of Cedi during the great Rājasūya sacrifice. I shall see all these heroic pastimes, along with many others You will perform during Your residence in Dvārakā. These pastimes are glorified on this earth in the songs of transcendental poets.

sakṛt—once; adhara—of the lips; sudhām—the nectar; svām—His own; mohinīm—bewildering; pāyayitvā—making drink; sumanasaḥ—flowers; iva—like; sadyaḥ—suddenly; tatyaje—He abandoned; asmān—us; bhavādṛk—like you; paricarati—serves; katham—why; tat—His; pāda-padmam—lotus feet; nu—I wonder; padmā—Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune; hi api—indeed, because; bata—alas; hṛta—taken away; cetāḥ—her mind; hi—certainly; uttama-śloka—of Kṛṣṇa; jalpaiḥ—by the false speech.
After making us drink the enchanting nectar of His lips only once, Kṛṣṇa suddenly abandoned us, just as you might quickly abandon some flowers. How is it, then, that Goddess Padmā willingly serves His lotus feet? Alas! The answer must certainly be that her mind has been stolen away by His deceitful words.

O bee, why do you sing here so much about the Lord of the Yadus, in front of us homeless people? These topics are old news to us. Better you sing about that friend of Arjuna in front of His new girlfriends, the burning desire in whose breasts He has now relieved. Those ladies will surely give you the charity you are begging.

In heaven, on earth or in the subterranean sphere, what women are unavailable to Him? He simply arches His eyebrows and smiles with deceptive charm, and they all become His. The supreme goddess herself worships the dust of His feet, so what is our position in comparison? But at least those who are wretched can chant His name, Uttamaśloka.

Keep your head off My feet! I know what you're doing. You expertly learned diplomacy from Mukunda, and now you come as His messenger with flattering words. But He abandoned those who for His sake alone gave up their children, husbands and all other relations. He's simply ungrateful. Why should I make up with Him now?

mṛgayuḥ—a hunter; iva—like; kapi—of the monkeys; indram—the king; vivyadhe—shot; lubdha-dharmā—behaving like a cruel hunter; striyam—a woman (namely, Śūrpaṇakhā); akṛta—made; virūpām—disfigured; strī—by a woman (Sītā-devī); jitaḥ—conquered; kāmayānām—who was impelled by lusty desire; balim—King Bali; api—also; balim—his tribute; attvā—consuming; aveṣṭayat—bound up; dhvāṅkṣavat—just like a crow; yaḥ—who; tat—therefore; alam—enough; asita—with black Kṛṣṇa; sakhyaiḥ—of all kinds of friendship; dustyajaḥ—impossible to give up; tat—about Him; kathā—of the topics; arthaḥ—the elaboration.
Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mahārāja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can't give up talking about Him.

To hear about the pastimes that Kṛṣṇa regularly performs is nectar for the ears. For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to Vṛndāvana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.

Faithfully taking His deceitful words as true, we became just like the black deer's foolish wives, who trust the cruel hunter's song. Thus we repeatedly felt the sharp pain of lust caused by the touch of His nails. O messenger, please talk about something besides Kṛṣṇa.

O Uddhava! It is indeed regrettable that Kṛṣṇa resides in Mathurā. Does He remember His father's household affairs and His friends, the cowherd boys? O great soul! Does He ever talk about us, His maidservants? When will He lay on our heads His aguru-scented hand?

etāḥ—these women; param—alone; tanu—their bodies; bhṛtaḥ—maintain successfully; bhuvi—on the earth; gopa-vadhvaḥ—the young cowherd women; govinde—for Lord Kṛṣṇa; eva—exclusively; nikhila—of all; ātmani—the Soul; rūḍha—perfected; bhāvāḥ—ecstatic loving attraction; vāṣchanti—they desire; yat—which; bhava—material existence; bhiyaḥ—those who are afraid of; munayaḥ—sages; vayam—we; ca—also; kim—what use; brahma—as a brāhmaṇa or as Lord Brahmā; janmabhiḥ—with births; ananta—of the unlimited Lord; kathā—for the topics; rasasya—for one who has a taste.
[Uddhava sang:] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brāhmaṇa, or even as Lord Brahmā himself?

How amazing it is that these simple women who wander about the forest, seemingly spoiled by improper behavior, have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul! Still, it is true that the Supreme Lord Himself awards His blessings even to an ignorant worshiper, just as the best medicine works even when taken by a person ignorant of its ingredients.

When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced by the arms of the Lord. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Indeed, never was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the beauty and fragrance of a lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to material estimation?

The gopīs of Vṛndāvana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to become one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vṛndāvana, because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.

The goddess of fortune herself, along with Lord Brahmā and all the other demigods, who are masters of yogic perfection, can worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa only within her mind. But during the rāsa dance Lord Kṛṣṇa placed His feet upon these gopīs' breasts, and by embracing those feet the gopīs gave up all distress.

Since I will be staying within the inner chambers of the palace, You may wonder, "How can I carry you away without killing some of your relatives?" But I shall tell You a way: On the day before the marriage there is a grand procession to honor the royal family's deity, and in this procession the new bride goes outside the city to visit Goddess Girijā.

O lotus-eyed one, great souls like Lord Śiva hanker to bathe in the dust of Your lotus feet and thereby destroy their ignorance. If I cannot obtain Your mercy, I shall simply give up my vital force, which will have become weak from the severe penances I will perform. Then, after hundreds of lifetimes of endeavor, I may obtain Your mercy.

Desiring to create, O unborn master, You increase and then assume the mode of passion. You do likewise with the mode of ignorance when You wish to annihilate the universe and with goodness when You wish to maintain it. Nonetheless, You remain uncovered by these modes. You are time, the pradhāna, and the puruṣa, O Lord of the universe, yet still You are separate and distinct.

Śrī Rukmiṇī said: Actually, what You have said is true, O lotus-eyed one. I am indeed unsuitable for the almighty Personality of Godhead. What comparison is there between that Supreme Lord, who is master of the three primal deities and who delights in His own glory, and myself, a woman of mundane qualities whose feet are grasped by fools?

Yes, my Lord Urukrama, You lay down within the ocean as if afraid of the material modes, and thus in pure consciousness You appear within the heart as the Supersoul. You are always battling against the foolish material senses, and indeed even Your servants reject the privilege of royal dominion, which leads to the blindness of ignorance.

You possess nothing because there is nothing beyond You. Even the great enjoyers of tribute—Brahmā and other demigods—pay tribute to You. Those who are blinded by their wealth and absorbed in gratifying their senses do not recognize You in the form of death. But to the gods, the enjoyers of tribute, You are the most dear, as they are to You.

You are the embodiment of all human goals and are Yourself the final aim of life. Desiring to attain You, O all-powerful Lord, intelligent persons abandon everything else. It is they who are worthy of Your association, not men and women absorbed in the pleasure and grief resulting from their mutual lust.

Knowing that great sages who have renounced the sannyāsī's daṇḍa proclaim Your glories, that You are the Supreme Soul of all the worlds, and that You are so gracious that You give away even Your own self, I chose You as my husband, rejecting Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the rulers of heaven, whose aspirations are all frustrated by the force of time, which is born from Your eyebrows. What interest, then, could I have in any other suitors?

My Lord, as a lion drives away lesser animals to claim his proper tribute, You drove off the assembled kings with the resounding twang of Your Śārṅga bow and then claimed me, Your fair share. Thus it is sheer foolishness, my dear Gadāgraja, for You to say You took shelter in the ocean out of fear of those kings.

The aroma of Your lotus feet, which is glorified by great saints, awards people liberation and is the abode of Goddess Lakṣmī.

Since You are the abode of transcendental qualities, what mortal woman with the insight to distinguish her own true interest would disregard that fragrance and depend instead on someone who is always subject to terrible fear?

I take shelter of You, the negation of this māyā.

We arrogantly disregarded You, O Lord, who stood before us as death. But now, O Kṛṣṇa, that powerful form of Yours called time, moving mysteriously and irresistibly, has deprived us of our opulences. Now that You have mercifully destroyed our pride, we beg simply to remember Your lotus feet.

Nor, O almighty Lord, will we hanker to enjoy the heavenly fruits of pious work in the next life, since the promise of such rewards is simply an empty enticement for the ears.

A sleeping person imagines an alternative reality for himself and, seeing himself as having various names and forms, forgets his waking identity, which is distinct from the dream. Similarly, the senses of one whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceive only the names and forms of material objects. Thus such a person loses his memory and cannot know You.

But only those who render You wholehearted devotional service and in this way vanquish the soul's covering—the material mind—attain You as their final destination. Therefore kindly show mercy to us, Your devotees.

Thus everything active in the material world is set into motion by the Supreme Lord.

Because of their ignorance, the entanglement of material work forces such souls to wander in the cycle of birth and death.

After manifesting each of these transcendental bodies to protect Your own principles of religion, You then made them unmanifest, thus appearing and disappearing like a cloud. O supremely glorified, all-pervading Lord, who can understand the mystic, deluding potency of Your opulent expansions?

Some of us have become attracted to You because of exceptional hatred, while others have become attracted because of their mood of devotion based on lust. But the demigods and others infatuated by material goodness feel no such attraction for You.

bṛhat—as the Supreme; upalabdham—perceived; etat—this (world); avayanti—they consider; avaśeṣatayā—in terms of its being the all-pervading foundation of existence; yataḥ—since; udaya—the generation; astamayau—and dissolution; vikṛteḥ—of a transformation; mṛdi—of clay; vā—as if; avikṛtāt—(the Supreme itself) not being subject to transformation; ataḥ—therefore; ṛṣayaḥ—the sages (who compiled the Vedic mantras); dadhuḥ—placed; tvayi—in You; manaḥ—their minds; vacana—words; ācaritam—and actions; katham—how; ayathā—not as they are; bhavanti—become; bhuvi—upon the ground; datta—placed; padāni—the steps; nṛṇām—of men.
This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence, remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all, how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?

kim uta punaḥ sva-dhāma-vidhutāśaya-kāla-guṇāḥ
parama bhajanti ye padam ajasra-sukhānubhavam
iti—thus; tava—Your; sūrayaḥ—wise saints; tri—of the three (planetary systems of the universe, or the three modes of nature); adhipate—O master; akhila—of all; loka—the worlds; mala—the contamination; kṣapaṇa—which eradicates; kathā—of discussions; amṛta—nectar; abdhim—into the ocean; avagāhya—by diving deeply; tapāṁsi—their troubles; jahuḥ—have given up; kim uta—what to speak; punaḥ—moreover; sva—their own; dhāma—by the power; vidhuta—dispelled; āśaya—of their minds; kāla—and of time; guṇāḥ—the (undesirable) qualities; parama—O supreme one; bhajanti—worship; ye—who; padam—Your true nature; ajasra—uninterrupted; sukha—of happiness; anubhavam—(in which there is) experience.
Therefore, O master of the three worlds, the wise get rid of all misery by diving deep into the nectarean ocean of topics about You, which washes away all the contamination of the universe. Then what to speak of those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature, O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?

dṛtayaḥ—bellows; iva—as if; śvasanti—they breathe; asu-bhṛtaḥ—alive; yadi—if; te—Your; anuvidhāḥ—faithful followers; mahat—the total material energy; aham—false ego; ādayaḥ—and the other elements of creation; aṇḍam—the universal egg; asṛjan—produced; yat—whose; anugrahataḥ—by the mercy; puruṣa—of the living entity; vidhaḥ—according to the particular forms; anvayaḥ—whose entrance; atra—among these; caramaḥ—the ultimate; anna-maya-ādiṣu—among the manifestations known as anna-maya and so on; yaḥ—who; sat-asataḥ—from gross and subtle matter; param—distinct; tvam—You; atha—and furthermore; yat—which; eṣu—among these; avaśeṣam—underlying; ṛtam—the reality.
Only if they become Your faithful followers are those who breathe actually alive; otherwise their breathing is like that of a bellows. It is by Your mercy alone that the elements, beginning with the mahat-tattva and false ego, created the egg of this universe. Among the manifestations known as anna-maya and so forth, You are the ultimate one, entering within the material coverings along with the living entity and assuming the same forms as those he takes. Distinct from the gross and subtle material manifestations, You are the reality underlying them all.

udaram—the abdomen; upāsate—worship; ye—who; ṛṣi—of sages; vartmasu—according to the standard methods; kūrpa—gross; dṛśaḥ—their vision; parisara—from which all the prāṇic channels emanate; paddhatim—the node; hṛdayam—the heart; āruṇayaḥ—the Āruṇi sages; daharam—subtle; tataḥ—thence; udagāt—(the soul) rises up; ananta—O unlimited Lord; tava—Your; dhāma—place of appearance; śiraḥ—to the head; paramam—the highest destination; punaḥ—again; iha—into this world; yat—which; sametya—reaching; na patanti—they do not fall down; kṛta-anta—of death; mukhe—into the mouth.
Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of the abdomen, while the Āruṇis worship Him as present in the heart, in the subtle center from which all the prāṇic channels emanate. From there, O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then, passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world, into the mouth of death.

sva—by Yourself; kṛta—created; vicitra—variegated; yoniṣu—within the species of life; viśan—entering; iva—apparently; hetutayā—as their motivation; taratamataḥ—according to hierarchies; cakāssi—You become visible; anala-vat—like fire; sva—Your own; kṛta—creation; anukṛtiḥ—imitating; atha—therefore; vitathāsu—unreal; amūṣu—among these (various species); avitatham—not unreal; tava—Your; dhāma—manifestation; samam—undifferentiated; viraja—spotless; dhiyaḥ—whose minds; anuyanti—understand; abhivipaṇyavaḥ—those who are free from all material entanglements (paṇa); eka-rasam—unchanging.
Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among all these impermanent life forms.

sva—by himself; kṛta—created; pureṣu—in the bodies; amīṣu—these; abahiḥ—not externally; antara—or internally; saṁvaraṇam—whose factual envelopment; tava—Your; puruṣam—living entity; vadanti—(the Vedas) say; akhila—of all; śakti—energies; dhṛtaḥ—of the possessor; aṁśa—as the expansion; kṛtam—manifested; iti—in this manner; nṛ—of the living entity; gatim—the status; vivicya—ascertaining; kavayaḥ—learned sages; nigama—of the Vedas; āvapanam—the field in which all offerings are sown; bhavataḥ—Your; upāsate—they worship; aṅghrim—the feet; abhavam—which cause the cessation of material existence; bhuvi—on the earth; viśvasitāḥ—having developed faith.
The individual living entity, while inhabiting the material bodies he has created for himself by his karma, actually remains uncovered by either gross or subtle matter. This is so because, as the Vedas describe, he is part and parcel of You, the possessor of all potencies. Having determined this to be the status of the living entity, learned sages become imbued with faith and worship Your lotus feet, to which all Vedic sacrifices in this world are offered, and which are the source of liberation.

duravagama—difficult to understand; ātma—of the self; tattva—the truth; nigamāya—in order to propagate; tava—of You; ātta—who have assumed; tanoḥ—Your personal forms; carita—of the pastimes; mahā—vast; amṛta—of nectar; abdhi—in the ocean; parivarta—by diving; pariśramaṇāḥ—who have been relieved of fatigue; na parilaṣanti—do not wish for; kecit—a few persons; apavargam—liberation; api—even; īśvara—O Lord; te—Your; caraṇa—at the feet; saroja—lotus; haṁsa—of swans; kula—with the community; saṅga—because of association; visṛṣṭa—abandoned; gṛhāḥ—whose homes.
My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet.

tvat—You; anupatham—useful for serving; kulāyam—body; idam—this; ātma—self; suhṛt—friend; priya—and beloved; vat—as; carati—acts; tathā—nevertheless; unmukhe—who are favorably disposed; tvayi—in You; hite—who are helpful; priye—who are affectionate; ātmani—who are their very Self; ca—and; na—not; bata—alas; ramanti—they take pleasure; aho—ah; asat—of the unreal; upāsanayā—by worship; ātma—themselves; hanaḥ—killing; yat—in which (worship of the unreal); anuśayāḥ—whose persistent desires; bhramanti—they wander; uru—greatly; bhaye—in the fearful (material existence); ku—degraded; śarīra—bodies; bhṛtaḥ—carrying.
When this human body is used for Your devotional service, it acts as one's self, friend and beloved. But unfortunately, although You always show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.

Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we śrutis, who generally see You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts in the same way.

kaḥ—who; iha—in this world; nu—indeed; veda—knows; bata—ah; avara—recent; janma—whose birth; layaḥ—and annihilation; agra-saram—who came first; yataḥ—from whom; udagāt—arose; ṛṣiḥ—the learned sage, Brahmā; yam anu—following whom (Brahmā); deva-gaṇāḥ—the groups of demigods; ubhaye—both (those who control the senses and those who live in the regions above the heavenly planets); tarhi—at that time; na—no; sat—gross matter; na—no; ca—also; asat—subtle matter; ubhayam—that which is comprised of both (namely, the material bodies); na ca—nor; kāla—of time; javaḥ—the flow; kim api na—none at all; tatra—there; śāstram—authoritative scripture; avakṛṣya—withdrawing; śayīta—(the Supreme Lord) lies down; yadā—when.
Everyone in this world has recently been born and will soon die. So how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahmā, and all subsequent demigods, both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything within Himself, nothing else remains—no gross or subtle matter or bodies composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.

janim—creation; asataḥ—of the manifest world (from atoms); sataḥ—of that which is eternal; mṛtim—destruction; uta—also; ātmani—in the soul; ye—who; ca—and; bhidām—duality; vipaṇam—mundane business; ṛtam—real; smaranti—declare authoritatively; upadiśanti—teach; te—they; ārupitaiḥ—in terms of illusions imposed on reality; tri—three; guṇa—of the material modes; mayaḥ—composed; pumān—the living entity; iti—thus; bhidā—dualistic conception; yat—which; abodha—by ignorance; kṛtā—created; tvayi—in You; na—not; tataḥ—to such; paratra—transcendental; saḥ—that (ignorance); bhavet—can exist; avabodha—total consciousness; rase—whose composition.
Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed, that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter, or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always enjoy perfect, total awareness.

sat—real; iva—as if; manaḥ—the mind (and its manifestations); tri-vṛt—threefold (by the modes of material nature); tvayi—in You; vibhāti—appears; asat—unreal; ā-manujāt—extending to the human beings; sat—as real; abhimṛśanti—they consider; aśeṣam—entire; idam—this (world); ātmatayā—as nondifferent from the Self; ātma-vidaḥ—the knowers of the Self; na—not; hi—indeed; vikṛtim—the transformations; tyajanti—reject; kanakasya—of gold; tat-ātmatayā—inasmuch as they are nondifferent from it; sva—by Himself; kṛtam—created; anupraviṣṭam—and entered; idam—this; ātmatayā—as nondifferent from Himself; avasitam—ascertained.
The three modes of material nature comprise everything in this world—from the simplest phenomena to the complex human body. Although these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still, those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord who created it and then entered within it.

tava—You; pari ye caranti—who worship; akhila—of all; sattva—created entities; niketatayā—as the shelter; te—they; uta—simply; padā—with their feet; ākramanti—step upon; avigaṇayya—disregarding; śiraḥ—the head; nirṛteḥ—of Death; parivayase—You tie up; paśūn iva—like animals; girā—with Your words (of the Vedas); vibudhān—wise; api—even; tān—them; tvayi—to whom; kṛta—those who have made; sauhṛdāḥ—friendship; khalu—indeed; punanti—purify; na—not; ye—who; vimukhāḥ—inimical.
The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves and others, not those who are inimical to You.

tvam—You; akaraṇaḥ—devoid of material senses; sva-rāṭ—self-effulgent; akhila—of all; kāraka—sensory functions; śakti—of the potencies; dharaḥ—the maintainer; tava—Your; balim—tribute; udvahanti—carry; samadanti—and partake of; ajayā—along with material nature; animiṣāḥ—the demigods; varṣa—of districts of a kingdom; bhujaḥ—the rulers; akhila—entire; kṣiti—of the land; pateḥ—of the lord; iva—as if; viśva—of the universe; sṛjaḥ—the creators; vidadhati—execute; yatra—in which; ye—they; tu—indeed; adhikṛtā—assigned; bhavataḥ—of You; cakitāḥ—afraid.
Though You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent sustainer of everyone's sensory powers. The demigods and material nature herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land, while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services out of fear of You.

sthira—stationary; cara—and moving; jātayaḥ—species of life; syuḥ—become manifest; ajayā—with the material energy; uttha—awakened; nimitta—their motivations for activity (and the subtle bodies activated by such); yujaḥ—assuming; viharaḥ—sport; udīkṣayā—by Your brief glance; yadi—if; parasya—of Him who is aloof; vimukta—O eternally liberated one; tataḥ—from her; na—not; hi—indeed; paramasya—for the supreme; kaścit—anyone; aparaḥ—not foreign; na—nor; paraḥ—foreign; ca—also; bhavet—can be; viyataḥ—for the ethereal sky; iva—as if; apadasya—which has no perceptible qualities; tava—for You; śūnya—to a void; tulām—a resemblance; dadhataḥ—who take on.
O eternally liberated, transcendental Lord, Your material energy causes the various moving and nonmoving species of life to appear by activating their material desires, but only when and if You sport with her by briefly glancing at her. You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, see no one as an intimate friend and no one as a stranger, just as the ethereal sky has no connection with perceptible qualities. In this sense You resemble a void.

If the countless living entities were all-pervading and possessed forms that never changed, You could not possibly be their absolute ruler, O immutable one. But since they are Your localized expansions and their forms are subject to change, You do control them. Indeed, that which supplies the ingredients for the generation of something is necessarily its controller because a product never exists apart from its ingredient cause. It is simply illusion for someone to think that he knows the Supreme Lord, who is equally present in each of His expansions, since whatever knowledge one gains by material means must be imperfect.

na ghaṭate—does not happen; udbhavaḥ—the generation; prakṛti—of material nature; pūruṣayoḥ—and of the soul who is her enjoyer; ajayoḥ—who are unborn; ubhaya—of both; yujā—by the combination; bhavanti—come into being; asu-bhṛtaḥ—living bodies; jala—on water; budbuda—bubbles; vat—like; tvayi—in You; te ime—these (living beings); tataḥ—therefore; vividha—various; nāma—with names; guṇaiḥ—and qualities; parame—in the Supreme; saritaḥ—rivers; iva—as; arṇave—within the ocean; madhuni—in honey; lilyuḥ—become merged; aśeṣa—all; rasāḥ—flavors.
Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey, so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.

The wise souls who understand how Your Māyā deludes all human beings render potent loving service to You, who are the source of liberation from birth and death. How, indeed, can fear of material life affect Your faithful servants? On the other hand, Your furrowing eyebrows—the triple-rimmed wheel of time—repeatedly terrify those who refuse to take shelter of You.

The mind is like an impetuous horse that even persons who have regulated their senses and breath cannot control. Those in this world who try to tame the uncontrolled mind, but who abandon the feet of their spiritual master, encounter hundreds of obstacles in their cultivation of various distressful practices. O unborn Lord, they are like merchants on a boat in the ocean who have failed to employ a helmsman.

To those persons who take shelter of You, You reveal Yourself as the Supersoul, the embodiment of all transcendental pleasure. What further use have such devotees for their servants, children or bodies, their wives, money or houses, their land, good health or conveyances? And for those who fail to appreciate the truth about You and go on pursuing the pleasures of sex, what could there be in this entire world—a place inherently doomed to destruction and devoid of significance—that could give them real happiness?

bhuvi—on the earth; puru—greatly; puṇya—pious; tīrtha—places of pilgrimage; sadanāni—and personal abodes of the Supreme Lord; ṛṣayaḥ—sages; vimadaḥ—free from false pride; te—they; uta—indeed; bhavat—Your; pada—feet; ambuja—lotus; hṛdaḥ—in whose hearts; agha—sins; bhit—which destroys; aṅghri—(having bathed) whose feet; jalāḥ—the water; dadhati—turn; sakṛt—even once; manaḥ—their minds; tvayi—toward You; ye—who; ātmani—toward the Supreme Soul; nitya—always; sukhe—who is happy; na punaḥ—never again; upāsate—they worship; puruṣa—of a man; sāra—the essential qualities; hara—which steal away; āvasathān—their mundane homes.
Sages free from false pride live on this earth by frequenting the sacred pilgrimage sites and those places where the Supreme Lord displayed His pastimes. Because such devotees keep Your lotus feet within their hearts, the water that washes their feet destroys all sins. Anyone who even once turns his mind toward You, the ever-blissful Soul of all existence, no longer dedicates himself to serving family life at home, which simply robs a man of his good qualities.

sata idaṁ utthitaṁ sad iti cen nanu tarka-hataṁ

vyavahṛtaye vikalpa iṣito 'ndha-paramparayā
bhramayati bhāratī ta uru-vṛttibhir uktha-jaḍān
sataḥ—from that which is permanent; idam—this (universe); utthitam—arisen; sat—permanent; iti—thus; cet—if (someone proposes); nanu—certainly; tarka—by logical contradiction; hatam—refuted; vyabhicarati—it is inconsistent; kva ca—in some cases; kva ca—in other cases; mṛṣā—illusion; na—not; tathā—so; ubhaya—of both (the real and illusion); yuk—the conjunction; vyavahṛtaye—for the sake of ordinary affairs; vikalpaḥ—an imaginary situation; iṣitaḥ—desired; andha—of blind men; paramparayā—by a succession; bhramayati—bewilder; bhāratī—the words of wisdom; te—Your; uru—numerous; vṛttibhiḥ—with their semantic functions; uktha—by ritual utterances; jaḍān—dulled.
It may be proposed that this world is permanently real because it is generated from the permanent reality, but such an argument is subject to logical refutation. Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their material affairs. With their various meanings and implications, the learned words of Your Vedas bewilder all persons whose minds have been dulled by hearing the incantations of sacrificial rituals.

na yad idam agra āsa na bhaviṣyad ato nidhanād
anu mitam antarā tvayi vibhāti mṛṣaika-rase
ata upamīyate draviṇa-jāti-vikalpa-pathair
vitatha-mano-vilāsam ṛtam ity avayanty abudhāḥ
na—not; yat—because; idam—this (universe); agre—in the beginning; āsa—existed; na bhaviṣyat—it will not exist; ataḥ—hence; nidhanāt anu—after its annihilation; mitam—deduced; antarā—in the meantime; tvayi—within You; vibhāti—it appears; mṛṣā—false; ekarase—whose experience of spiritual ecstasy is unchanging; ataḥ—thus; upamīyate—it is understood by comparison; draviṇa—of material substance; jāti—in the categories; vikalpa—of the transformations; pathaiḥ—with the varieties; vitatha—contrary to fact; manaḥ—of the mind; vilāsam—fantasy; ṛtam—real; iti—so; avayanti—think; abudhaḥ—the unintelligent.
Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe to the transformation of various material substances into diverse forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination is substantially real are less intelligent.

saḥ—he (the individual living entity); yat—because; ajayā—by the influence of the material energy; tu—but; ajām—that material energy; anuśayīta—lies down next to; guṇān—her qualities; ca—and; juṣan—assuming; bhajati—he takes on; sa-rūpatām—forms resembling (the qualities of nature); tat-anu—following that; mṛtyum—death; apeta—deprived; bhagaḥ—of his assets; tvam—You; uta—on the other hand; jahāsi—leave aside; tām—her (the material energy); ahiḥ—a snake; iva—as if; tvacam—its (old, discarded) skin; ātta-bhagaḥ—endowed with all assets; mahasi—in Your spiritual powers; mahīyase—You are glorified; aṣṭa-guṇite—eightfold; aparimeya—unlimited; bhagaḥ—whose greatness.
The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.

yadi—if; na samuddharanti—they do not uproot; yatayaḥ—persons in the renounced order of life; hṛdi—in their hearts; kāma—of material desire; jaṭāḥ—the traces; duradhigamaḥ—impossible to be realized; asatām—for the impure; hṛdi—in the heart; gataḥ—having entered; asmṛta—forgotten; kaṇṭha—on one's neck; maṇiḥ—a jewel; asu—their life airs; tṛpa—who gratify; yoginām—for practitioners of yoga; ubhayataḥ—in both (worlds); api—even; asukham—unhappiness; bhagavan—O Personality of Godhead; anapagata—not gone away; antakāt—from death; anadhirūḍha—unobtained; padāt—whose kingdom; bhavataḥ—from You.
Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts, for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a man who has totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who practice yoga only for sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next: from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they cannot reach.

tvat—You; avagamī—one who understands; na vetti—does not pay regard; bhavat—from You; uttha—rising; śubha-aśubhayoḥ—of the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness; guṇa-viguṇa—of good and bad; anvayān—to the attributions; tarhi—consequently; deha-bhṛtām—of embodied living beings; ca—also; giraḥ—the words; anu-yugam—in every age; anu-aham—every day; sa-guṇa—O You who are endowed with qualities; gīta—of recitation; paramparayā—by the chain of succession; śravaṇa—through hearing; bhṛtaḥ—carried; yataḥ—because of this; tvam—You; apavarga—of liberation; gatiḥ—the ultimate goal; manujaiḥ—by human beings, descendants of Manu.
When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu's descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation.

dyu—of heaven; patayaḥ—the masters; eva—even; te—Your; na yayuḥ—cannot reach; antam—the end; anantatayā—because of being unlimited; tvam—You; api—even; yat—whom; antara—within; aṇḍa—of universes; nicayāḥ—multitudes; nanu—indeed; sa—along with; āvaranāḥ—their outer shells; khe—in the sky; iva—as; rajāṁsi—particles of dust; vānti—blow about; vayasā saha—with the wheel of time; yat—because; śrutayaḥ—the Vedas; tvayi—in You; hi—indeed; phalanti—bear fruit; atat—of that which is distinct from the Absolute Truth; nirasanena—by the elimination; bhavat—in You; nidhanāḥ—whose ultimate conclusion.
Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion.

tīrtham—sacred place of pilgrimage; cakre—made; nṛpa—O King (Parīkṣit); ūnam—lesser; yat—which (glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa); ajani—He took birth; yaduṣu—among the Yadus; svaḥ—of heaven; sarit—the river; pāda—whose feet; śaucam—(the water) which washes; vidviṭ—enemies; snigdhāḥ—and loved ones; svarūpam—whose personal form; yayuḥ—attained; ajita—who is undefeated; parā—and supremely perfect; śrīḥ—the goddess of fortune; yat—whose; arthe—for the sake; anya—of others; yatnaḥ—endeavor; yat—whose; nāma—name; amaṅgala—inauspiciousness; ghnam—which destroys; śrutam—heard; atha—or else; gaditam—chanted; yat—by whom; kṛtaḥ—created; gotra—among the lines of descent (of various sages); dharmaḥ—the religious principles; kṛṣṇasya—for Lord Kṛṣṇa; etat—this; na—not; citram—wonderful; kṣiti—the earth's; bhara—of the burden; haraṇam—the removal; kāla—of time; cakra—the wheel; āyudhasya—whose weapon.
The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord Kṛṣṇa's feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated Kṛṣṇa and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?

jayati—eternally lives gloriously; jana-nivāsaḥ—He who lives among human beings like the members of the Yadu dynasty and is the ultimate resort of all living entities; devakī-janma-vādaḥ—known as the son of Devakī (No one can actually become the father or mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore devakī-janma-vada means that He is known as the son of Devakī. Similarly, He is also known as the son of Mother Yaśodā, Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja.); yadu-vara-pariṣat—served by the members of the Yadu dynasty or the cowherd men of Vṛndāvana (all of whom are constant associates of the Supreme Lord and are the Lord's eternal servants); svaiḥ dorbhiḥ—by His own arms, or by His devotees like Arjuna who are just like His own arms; asyan—killing; adharmam—demons or the impious; sthira-cara-vṛjina-ghnaḥ—the destroyer of all the ill fortune of all living entities, moving and not moving; su-smita—always smiling; śrī-mukhena—by His beautiful face; vraja-pura-vanitānām—of the damsels of Vṛndāvana; vardhayan—increasing; kāma-devam—the lusty desires.
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is He who is known as jana-nivāsa, the ultimate resort of all living entities, and who is also known as Devakīnandana or Yaśodā-nandana, the son of Devakī and Yaśodā. He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious. By His presence He destroys all things inauspicious for all living entities, moving and inert. His blissful smiling face always increases the lusty desires of the gopīs of Vṛndāvana. May He be all glorious and happy!

To protect the principles of devotional service to Himself, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the best of the Yadus, accepts the pastime forms that have been glorified here in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. One who desires to faithfully serve His lotus feet should hear of the activities He performs in each of these incarnations—activities that suitably imitate those of the forms He assumes. Hearing narrations of these pastimes destroys the reactions to fruitive work.

By regularly hearing, chanting and meditating on the beautiful topics of Lord Mukunda with ever-increasing sincerity, a mortal being will attain the divine kingdom of the Lord, where the inviolable power of death holds no sway. For this purpose, many persons, including great kings, abandoned their mundane homes and took to the forest.

The demigods place many obstacles on the path of those who worship You to transcend the temporary abodes of the demigods and reach Your supreme abode. Those who offer the demigods their assigned shares in sacrificial performances encounter no such obstacles. But because You are the direct protector of Your devotee, he is able to step over the head of whatever obstacle the demigods place before him.

Some men practice severe penances to cross beyond our influence, which is like an immeasurable ocean with endless waves of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and the other conditions brought about by the passing of time, such as the sensuous wind and the urges of the tongue and sex organs. Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.

O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain and devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent of māyā, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never affected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal spiritual bliss, and thus You cannot be accused of any material infection.

Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. May Your lotus feet become the blazing fire that burns to ashes all our inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.

Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lakṣmī and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.

O omnipotent Lord, in Your incarnation as Trivikrama, You raised Your leg like a flagpole to break the shell of the universe, allowing the holy Ganges to flow down, like a banner of victory, in three branches throughout the three planetary systems. By three mighty steps of Your lotus feet, Your Lordship captured Bali Mahārāja, along with his universal kingdom. Your lotus feet inspire fear in the demons by driving them down to hell and fearlessness among Your devotees by elevating them to the perfection of heavenly life. We are sincerely trying to worship You, our Lord; therefore may Your lotus feet kindly free us from all of our sinful reactions.

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the transcendental entity who is superior to both material nature and the enjoyer of nature. May Your lotus feet bestow transcendental pleasure upon us. All of the great demigods, beginning with Brahmā, are embodied living entities. Struggling painfully with one another under the strict control of Your time factor, they are just like bulls dragged by ropes tied through their pierced noses.

As the threefold wheel of time You diminish all things by Your imperceptible actions, and thus You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My dear Lord, the original puruṣa-avatāra, Mahā-Viṣṇu, acquires His creative potency from You. Thus with infallible energy He impregnates material nature, producing the mahat-tattva. Then the mahat-tattva, the amalgamated material energy, endowed with the potency of the Lord, produces from itself the primeval golden egg of the universe, which is covered by various layers of material elements.

You are Hṛṣīkeśa, the supreme controller of all sensory activity, and thus You never become contaminated or entangled in the course of Your supervision of the infinite sensory activities within the material creation. On the other hand, other living entities, even yogīs and philosophers, are disturbed and frightened simply by remembering the material objects that they have supposedly renounced in their pursuit of enlightenment.

Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it.

Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said: O almighty Lord, how can I possibly describe You? You awaken the vital air, which then impels the mind, senses and power of speech to act. This is true for all ordinary conditioned souls and even for great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva. So it is certainly true for me. Nevertheless, You become the intimate friend of those who worship You.

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, these two personal forms of Yours have appeared in order  to bestow the ultimate benefit for the three worlds—the cessation of material misery and the conquest of death. My Lord, although You create this universe and then assume many transcendental forms to protect it, You also swallow it up, just like a spider who spins and later withdraws its web.

Because You are the protector and the supreme controller of all moving and nonmoving beings, anyone who takes shelter of Your lotus feet can never be touched by the contamination of material work, material qualities or time. Great sages who have assimilated the essential meaning of the Vedaṣ offer their prayers to You. To gain Your association, they bow down to You at every opportunity and constantly worship You and meditate upon You.

My dear Lord, even Lord Brahmā, who enjoys his exalted position for the entire duration of the universe, fears the passage of time.

I do not know of any relief from this fear except shelter at Your lotus feet, which are the very form of liberation.

O my Lord, O supreme friend of the conditioned soul, although for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world You accept the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, which constitute Your illusory potency, You specifically employ the mode of goodness to liberate the conditioned souls. The other two modes simply bring them suffering, illusion and fear.

O Lord, because fearlessness, spiritual happiness and the kingdom of God are all achieved through the mode of pure goodness, Your devotees consider this mode, but never passion and ignorance, to be a direct manifestation of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Intelligent persons thus worship Your beloved transcendental form, composed of pure goodness, along with the spiritual forms of Your pure devotees.

A materialist, his intelligence perverted by the action of his deceptive senses, cannot recognize You at all, although You are always present within his own senses and heart and also among the objects of his perception. Yet even though one's understanding has been covered by Your illusory potency, if one obtains Vedic knowledge from You, the supreme spiritual master of all, he can directly understand You.

My dear Lord, the Vedic literatures alone reveal confidential knowledge of Your supreme personality, and thus even such great scholars as Lord Brahmā himself are bewildered in their attempt to understand You through empirical methods. Each philosopher understands You according to his particular speculative conclusions. I worship that Supreme Person, knowledge of whom is hidden by the bodily designations covering the conditioned soul's spiritual identity.

naitāvatā bhagavataḥ
sva-māyā-maya-vṛttibhiḥ
na duṣyetānubhāvas tair
māyinaḥ kuhakaṁ yathā
na—not; etāvatā—by such (a show of humility); bhagavataḥ—of the Personality of Godhead; sva-māyā—of His own illusory energy; maya—consisting of; vṛttibhiḥ—by the activities; na duṣyeta—is not spoiled; anubhāvaḥ—the power; taiḥ—by them; māyinaḥ—of a magician; kuhakam—the tricks; yathā—just as.
This apparent humility is simply a show of mercy. Such behavior of the Supreme Lord and His personal associates, which the Lord effects by His own bewildering potency, does not spoil His power any more than a magician's powers are diminished by his exhibition of tricks.

sṛṣṭvedaṁ manasā viśvam
ātmanānupraviśya yaḥ
guṇaiḥ kurvadbhir ābhāti
karteva svapna-dṛg yathā
tasmai namo bhagavate
tri-guṇāya guṇātmane
kevalāyādvitīyāya
gurave brahma-mūrtaye
sṛṣṭvā—creating; idam—this; manasā—by His mind, simply by His desire; viśvam—the universe; ātmanā—as the Supersoul; anupraviśya—subsequently entering; yaḥ—who; guṇaiḥ—by the modes of nature; kurvadbhiḥ—which are acting; ābhāti—appears; kartā iva—as if the doer; svapna-dṛk—a person who is seeing a dream; yathā—as; tasmai—unto Him; namaḥ—obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tri-guṇāya—who possesses the three modes of nature; guṇa-ātmane—who is the ultimate controller of the modes of nature; kevalāya—to the pure; advitīyāya—who has no equal; gurave—the supreme spiritual master; brahma-mūrtaye—the personal form of the Absolute Truth.
I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created this entire universe simply by His desire and then entered into it as the Supersoul. By making the modes of nature act, He seems to be the direct creator of this world, just as a dreamer seems to be acting within his dream. He is the owner and ultimate controller of the three modes of nature, yet He remains alone and pure, without any equal. He is the supreme spiritual master of all, the original personal form of the Absolute Truth.
