oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya
janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ
tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ
tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ yathā vinimayo yatra tri-sargo 'mṛṣā
dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi
om—O my Lord; namaḥ—offering my obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Personality of Godhead; vāsudevāya—unto Vāsudeva (the son of Vasudeva), or Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the primeval Lord; janma-ādi—creation, sustenance and destruction; asya—of the manifested universes; yataḥ—from whom; anvayāt—directly; itarataḥ—indirectly; ca—and; artheṣu—purposes; abhijñaḥ—fully cognizant; sva-rāṭ—fully independent; tene—imparted; brahma—the Vedic knowledge; hṛdā—consciousness of the heart; yaḥ—one who; ādi-kavaye—unto the original created being; muhyanti—are illusioned; yat—about whom; sūrayaḥ—great sages and demigods; tejaḥ—fire; vāri—water; mṛdām—earth; yathā—as much as; vinimayaḥ—action and reaction; yatra—whereupon; tri-sargaḥ—three modes of creation, creative faculties; amṛṣā—almost factual; dhāmnā—along with all transcendental paraphernalia; svena—self-sufficiently; sadā—always; nirasta—negation by absence; kuhakam—illusion; satyam—truth; param—absolute; dhīmahi—I do meditate upon.
O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.

dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ
vedyaṁ vāstavam atra vastu śivadaṁ tāpa-trayonmūlanam

Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bhāgavata Purāṇa propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhāgavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyāsadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of the Bhāgavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.

Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.

Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.

Others, who are pacified by means of transcendental self-realization and have conquered over the modes of nature by dint of strong power and knowledge, also enter into You, but for them there is much pain, whereas the devotee simply discharges devotional service and thus feels no such pain.

O original person, we are therefore but Yours only. Although we are Your creatures, we are born one after another under the influence of the three modes of nature, and for this reason we are separated in action. Therefore, after the creation we could not act concertedly for Your transcendental pleasure.

Lord Brahmā said: O my Lord, today, after many, many years of penance, I have come to know about You. Oh, how unfortunate the embodied living entities are that they are unable to know Your personality! My Lord, You are the only knowable object because there is nothing supreme beyond You. If there is anything supposedly superior to You, it is not the Absolute. You exist as the Supreme by exhibiting the creative energy of matter.

Since You have manifested this eternal personal form upon whom Your devotees meditate, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Those who are destined to be dispatched to the path of hell neglect Your personal form because of speculating on material topics.

They always try to protect their wealth, body and friends, they are filled with lamentation and unlawful desires concerning their paraphernalia, and they avariciously base their undertakings on the perishable conceptions of "my" and "mine." As long as they do not take shelter of Your safe lotus feet, they are full of such anxieties.

Therefore, without the Lord's mercy, how can he again engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord?

No one other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the localized Paramātmā, the partial representation of the Lord, is directing all inanimate and animate objects. He is present in the three phases of time-past, present and future. Therefore, the conditioned soul is engaged in different activities by His direction, and in order to get free from the threefold miseries of this conditional life, we have to surrender unto Him only.

The living entity in another type of body sees only by instinct; he knows only the agreeable and disagreeable sense perceptions of that particular body.

Therefore, my Lord, although I am living in a terrible condition, I do not wish to depart from my mother's abdomen to fall again into the blind well of materialistic life. Your external energy, called deva-māyā, at once captures the newly born child, and immediately false identification, which is the beginning of the cycle of continual birth and death, begins.

My dear Lord, although personally You have nothing to do, You have distributed Your energies in the interactions of the material modes of nature, and for that reason the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation take place. My dear Lord, You are self-determined and are the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities. For them You created this material manifestation, and although You are one, Your diverse energies can act multifariously. This is inconceivable to us.

Similarly, You have appeared in order to distribute transcendental knowledge to Your dependents.

To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.

Oh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the Āryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required.

I believe, my Lord, that You are Lord Viṣṇu Himself under the name of Kapila, and You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman! The saints and sages, being freed from all the disturbances of the senses and mind, meditate upon You, for by Your mercy only can one become free from the clutches of the three modes of material nature. At the time of dissolution, all the Vedas are sustained in You only.

But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or other he gathered his senses, and with folded hands and sweet words he began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe. The great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu and Lord Śiva, you have divided yourself into three bodies by accepting the three modes of material nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all of you and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my prayer.

I called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, desiring a son like Him, and I thought of Him only. But although He is far beyond the mental speculation of man, all three of you have come here. Kindly let me know how you have come, for I am greatly bewildered about this.

O most auspicious lord, you have ordained the heavenly planets, the spiritual Vaikuṇṭha planets and the impersonal Brahman sphere as the respective destinations of the performers of auspicious activities. Similarly, for others, who are miscreants, you have destined different kinds of hells which are horrible and ghastly. Yet sometimes it is found that their destinations are just the opposite. It is very difficult to ascertain the cause of this.

My dear Lord, devotees who have fully dedicated their lives unto your lotus feet certainly observe your presence as Paramātmā in each and every being, and as such they do not differentiate between one living being and another. Such persons treat all living entities equally. They never become overwhelmed by anger like animals, who can see nothing without differentiation.

Thus there is no need for them to be killed again by an exalted personality like you.

My dear lord, if in some places materialists, who are already bewildered by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme Godhead, sometimes commit offenses, a saintly person, with compassion, does not take this seriously. Knowing that they commit offenses because they are overpowered by the illusory energy, he does not show his prowess to counteract them.

My dear Lord Śiva, you are a shareholder of a portion of the sacrifice, and you are the giver of the result. The bad priests did not deliver your share, and therefore you destroyed everything, and the sacrifice remains unfinished. Now you can do the needful and take your rightful share.

Dakṣa addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead: My dear Lord, You are transcendental to all speculative positions. You are completely spiritual, devoid of all fear, and You are always in control of the material energy. Even though You appear in the material energy, You are situated transcendentally. You are always free from material contamination because You are completely self-sufficient.

The priests addressed the Lord, saying: O Lord, transcendental to material contamination, by the curse offered by Lord Śiva's men we have become attached to fruitive activities, and thus we are now fallen and therefore do not know anything about You. On the contrary, we are now involved in the injunctions of the three departments of the Vedic knowledge under the plea of executing rituals in the name of yajña. We know that You have made arrangements for distributing the respective shares of the demigods.

The members of the assembly addressed the Lord: O exclusive shelter for all who are situated in troubled life, in this formidable fort of conditional existence the time element, like a snake, is always looking for an opportunity to strike. This world is full of ditches of so-called distress and happiness, and there are many ferocious animals always ready to attack. The fire of lamentation is always blazing, and the mirage of false happiness is always alluring, but one has no shelter from them. Thus foolish persons live in the cycle of birth and death, always overburdened in discharging their so-called duties, and we do not know when they will accept the shelter of Your lotus feet.

With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am no longer disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my activities are not purified. I do not mind their accusations, and I excuse them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion toward all living entities.

Śrī Bhṛgu said: My dear Lord, all living entities, beginning from the highest, namely Lord Brahmā, down to the ordinary ant, are under the influence of the insurmountable spell of illusory energy, and thus they are ignorant of their constitutional position. Everyone believes in the concept of the body, and all are thus submerged in the darkness of illusion. They are actually unable to understand how You live in every living entity as the Supersoul, nor can they understand Your absolute position. But You are the eternal friend and protector of all surrendered souls. Therefore, please be kind toward us and forgive all our offenses.

Lord Brahmā said: My dear Lord, Your personality and eternal form cannot be understood by any person who is trying to know You through the different processes of acquiring knowledge. Your position is always transcendental to the material creation, whereas the empiric attempt to understand You is material, as are its objectives and instruments.

The wives of the performers of the sacrifice said: My dear Lord, this sacrifice was arranged under the instruction of Brahmā, but unfortunately Lord Śiva, being angry at Dakṣa, devastated the entire scene, and because of his anger the animals meant for sacrifice are lying dead. Therefore the preparations of the yajña have been lost. Now, by the glance of Your lotus eyes, the sanctity of this sacrificial arena may be again invoked.

The sages prayed: Dear Lord, Your activities are most wonderful, and although You do everything by Your different potencies, You are not at all attached to such activities. You are not even attached to the goddess of fortune, who is worshiped by the great demigods like Brahmā, who pray to achieve her mercy.

I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, and I request that You be pleased on this occasion. The sacrificial arena is not beautiful without You, just as a body is not beautiful without the head.

The governors of various planets spoke as follows: Dear Lord, we believe only in our direct perception, but under the circumstances we do not know whether we have actually seen You with our material senses. By our material senses we can simply perceive the cosmic manifestation, but You are beyond the five elements. You are the sixth. We see You, therefore, as a creation of the material world.

You are very favorable toward those who engage in devotional service, accepting You as the Lord and themselves as the servants. By Your mercy, You are always inclined in their favor.

At that time, all the inhabitants of the higher planets, represented by such liberated souls as Sanaka, were meditating on You by philosophical speculation. You are therefore the original person, and You rest in the water of devastation on the bed of the Śeṣa snake. Now, today, You are visible to us, who are all Your servants. Please give us protection.

He is misled and always attracted by temporary, illusory happiness. But Your transcendental activities are so powerful that if one engages in the hearing and chanting of such topics, he can be delivered from illusion.

The brāhmaṇas said: Dear Lord, You are sacrifice personified. You are the offering of clarified butter, You are the fire, You are the chanting of Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the fuel, You are the flame, You are the kuśa grass, and You are the sacrificial pots. You are the priests who perform the yajña, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.

Dear Lord, O personified Vedic knowledge, in the past millennium, long, long ago, when You appeared as the great boar incarnation, You picked up the world from the water, as an elephant picks up a lotus flower from a lake. When You vibrated transcendental sound in that gigantic form of a boar, the sound was accepted as a sacrificial hymn, and great sages like Sanaka meditated upon it and offered prayers for Your glorification.

Dear Lord, we were awaiting Your audience because we have been unable to perform the yajñas according to the Vedic rituals. We pray unto You, therefore, to be pleased with us. Simply by chanting Your holy name, one can surpass all obstacles. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You in Your presence.

Dhruva Mahārāja said: My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After entering within me, You have enlivened all my sleeping senses—my hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, You are the supreme one, but by Your different energies You appear differently in the spiritual and material worlds. You create the total energy of the material world by Your external potency, and after creation You enter within the material world as the Supersoul. You are the Supreme Person, and through the temporary modes of material nature You create varieties of manifestation, just as fire, entering into wood of different shapes, burns brilliantly in different varieties.

O my master, Lord Brahmā is fully surrendered unto You. In the beginning You gave him knowledge, and thus he could see and understand the entire universe, just as a person awakens from sleep and visualizes his immediate duties. You are the only shelter of all persons who desire liberation, and You are the friend of all who are distressed. How, therefore, can a learned person who has perfect knowledge ever forget You?

nūnam—certainly; vimuṣṭa-matayaḥ—those who have lost their right intelligence; tava—Your; māyayā—by the influence of the illusory energy; te—they; ye—who; tvām—You; bhava—from birth; apyaya—and death; vimokṣaṇam—the cause of liberation; anya-hetoḥ—for other purposes; arcanti—worship; kalpaka-tarum—who are like the desire tree; kuṇapa—of this dead body; upabhogyam—sense gratification; icchanti—they desire; yat—that which; sparśa-jam—derived by touch sensation; niraye—in hell; api—even; nṝṇām—for persons.
Persons who worship You simply for the sense gratification of this bag of skin are certainly influenced by Your illusory energy. In spite of having You, who are like a desire tree and are the cause of liberation from birth and death, foolish persons, such as me, desire benedictions from You for sense gratification, which is available even for those who live in hellish conditions.

yā—that which; nirvṛtiḥ—bliss; tanu-bhṛtām—of the embodied; tava—Your; pāda-padma—lotus feet; dhyānāt—from meditating upon; bhavat-jana—from Your intimate devotees; kathā—topics; śravaṇena—by hearing; vā—or; syāt—comes into being; sā—that bliss; brahmaṇi—in the impersonal Brahman; sva-mahimani—Your own magnificence; api—even; nātha—O Lord; mā—never; bhūt—exists; kim—what to speak of; tu—then; antaka-asi—by the sword of death; lulitāt—being destroyed; patatām—of those who fall down; vimānāt—from their airplanes.
My Lord, the transcendental bliss derived from meditating upon Your lotus feet or hearing about Your glories from pure devotees is so unlimited that it is far beyond the stage of brahmānanda, wherein one thinks himself merged in the impersonal Brahman as one with the Supreme. Since brahmānanda is also defeated by the transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, then what to speak of the temporary blissfulness of elevating oneself to the heavenly planets, which is ended by the separating sword of time? Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, he falls down in due course of time.

Dhruva Mahārāja continued: O unlimited Lord, kindly bless me so that I may associate with great devotees who engage in Your transcendental loving service constantly, as the waves of a river constantly flow. Such transcendental devotees are completely situated in an uncontaminated state of life. By the process of devotional service I shall surely be able to cross the nescient ocean of material existence, which is filled with the waves of blazing, firelike dangers. It will be very easy for me, for I am becoming mad to hear about Your transcendental qualities and pastimes, which are eternally existent.

O Lord who have a lotus navel, if a person happens to associate with a devotee whose heart always hankers after Your lotus feet, seeking always their fragrance, he is never attached to the material body or, in a bodily relationship, to offspring, friends, home, wealth and wife, which are very, very dear to materialistic persons. Indeed, he does not care for them.

My dear Lord, O Supreme Unborn, I know that the different varieties of living entities, such as animals, trees, birds, reptiles, demigods and human beings, are spread throughout the universe, which is caused by the total material energy, and I know that they are sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest; but I have never experienced the supreme form I behold as I see You now. Now all kinds of methods of theorizing have come to an end.

My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium the Supreme Personality of Godhead Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu dissolves everything manifested within the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Śeṣa Nāga, from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord Brahmā is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, by Your unbroken transcendental glance You are the supreme witness of all stages of intellectual activities. You are eternally liberated, Your existence is situated in pure goodness, and You are existent in the Supersoul without change. You are the original Personality of Godhead, full with six opulences, and You are eternally the master of the three modes of material nature. Thus, You are always different from the ordinary living entities. As Lord Viṣṇu, You maintain all the affairs of the entire universe, and yet You stand aloof and are the enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices.

My dear Lord, in Your impersonal manifestation of Brahman there are always two opposing elements—knowledge and ignorance. Your multienergies are continually manifest, but the impersonal Brahman, which is undivided, original, changeless, unlimited and blissful, is the cause of the material manifestation. Because You are the same impersonal Brahman, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, O Supreme Lord, You are the supreme personified form of all benediction. Therefore, for one who abides in Your devotional service with no other desire, worshiping Your lotus feet is better than becoming king and lording it over a kingdom. That is the benediction of worshiping Your lotus feet. To ignorant devotees like me, You are the causelessly merciful maintainer, just like a cow, who takes care of the newly born calf by supplying milk and giving it protection from attack.

The planet earth spoke: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are transcendental in Your position, and by Your material energy You have expanded Yourself in various forms and species of life through the interaction of the three modes of material nature. Unlike some other masters, You always remain in Your transcendental position and are not affected by the material creation, which is subject to different material interactions. Consequently You are not bewildered by material activities.

The planet earth continued: My dear Lord, You are the complete conductor of the material creation. You have created this cosmic manifestation and the three material qualities, and therefore You have created me, the planet earth, the resting place of all living entities. Yet You are always fully independent, my Lord. Now that You are present before me and ready to kill me with Your weapons, let me know where I should go to take shelter, and tell me who can give me protection.

In the beginning of creation You created all these moving and nonmoving living entities by Your inconceivable energy. Through this very same energy You are now prepared to protect the living entities. Indeed, You are the supreme protector of religious principles. Why are You so anxious to kill me, even though I am in the form of a cow?

My dear Lord, although You are one, by Your inconceivable potencies You have expanded Yourself in many forms. Through the agency of Brahmā, You have created this universe. You are therefore directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are not sufficiently experienced cannot understand Your transcendental activities because these persons are covered by Your illusory energy.

My dear Lord, by Your own potencies You are the original cause of the material elements, as well as the performing instruments (the senses), the workers of the senses (the controlling demigods), the intelligence and the ego, as well as everything else. By Your energy You manifest this entire cosmic creation, maintain it and dissolve it. Through Your energy alone everything is sometimes manifest and sometimes not manifest. You are therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My dear Lord, in this way You once protected me by rescuing me from the water, and consequently Your name has been famous as Dharādhara—He who holds the planet earth. Yet at the present moment, in the form of a great hero, You are about to kill me with sharpened arrows. I am, however, just like a boat on the water, keeping everything afloat.

My dear Lord, I am also the creation of one of Your energies, composed of the three modes of material nature. Consequently I am bewildered by Your activities. Even the activities of Your devotees cannot be understood, and what to speak of Your pastimes. Thus everything appears to us to be contradictory and wonderful.

My dear Lord, You are the best of the demigods who can offer benedictions. Why, therefore, should any learned person ask You for benedictions meant for living entities bewildered by the modes of nature? Such benedictions are available automatically, even in the lives of living entities suffering in hellish conditions. My dear Lord, You can certainly bestow merging into Your existence, but I do not wish to have such a benediction.

My dear Lord, I therefore do not wish to have the benediction of merging into Your existence, a benediction in which there is no existence of the nectarean beverage of Your lotus feet. I want the benediction of at least one million ears, for thus I may be able to hear about the glories of Your lotus feet from the mouths of Your pure devotees.

My dear Lord, You are glorified by the selected verses uttered by great personalities. Such glorification of Your lotus feet is just like saffron particles. When the transcendental vibration from the mouths of great devotees carries the aroma of the saffron dust of Your lotus feet, the forgetful living entity gradually remembers his eternal relationship with You. Devotees thus gradually come to the right conclusion about the value of life. My dear Lord, I therefore do not need any other benediction but the opportunity to hear from the mouth of Your pure devotee.

My dear highly glorified Lord, if one, in the association of pure devotees, hears even once the glories of Your activities, he does not, unless he is nothing but an animal, give up the association of devotees, for no intelligent person would be so careless as to leave their association. The perfection of chanting and hearing about Your glories was accepted even by the goddess of fortune, who desired to hear of Your unlimited activities and transcendental glories.

Now I wish to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to serve just like the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand, because His Lordship, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. I am afraid that the goddess of fortune and I would quarrel because both of us would be attentively engaged in the same service.

My dear Lord of the universe, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, is the mother of the universe, and yet I think that she may be angry with me because of my intruding upon her service and acting on that very platform to which she is so much attached. Yet I am hopeful that even though there is some misunderstanding, You will take my part, for You are very much inclined to the poor and You always magnify even insignificant service unto You. Therefore even though she becomes angry, I think that there is no harm for You, because You are so self-sufficient that You can do without her.

Great saintly persons who are always liberated take to Your devotional service because only by devotional service can one be relieved from the illusions of material existence.

Therefore, please do not ask me to take some material benefits from You, but as a father, not waiting for the son's demand, does everything for the benefit of the son, please bestow upon me whatever You think best for me.

It is stated both in the Vedas and in the śāstras that are corollaries of the Vedas, and indeed everywhere, that it is only You who are to be worshiped. That is the expert version of all the Vedas.

Thus the material world is created.

Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.

When the Lord, out of His natural compassion, thinks of His devotee, by that process only are all desires of the neophyte devotee fulfilled.

Although we are very insignificant, why should the Lord not know our desires?

Indeed, they recite the holy name again and again.

Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brāhmaṇas, advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.

Dear Lord, even great yogīs and mystics who are very much advanced by virtue of austerities and knowledge and who have completely situated themselves in pure existence, as well as great personalities like Manu, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, cannot fully understand Your glories and potencies. Nonetheless they have offered their prayers according to their own capacities. In the same way, we, although much lower than these personalities, also offer our prayers according to our own capability.

Although You are full in Yourself, please, out of Your causeless mercy, accept a little service from us, Your eternal servants. We are not actually aware of Your transcendental form, but we can simply offer our respectful obeisances again and again, as instructed by the Vedic literatures and authorized äcäryas. Materialistic living entities are very much attracted to the modes of material nature, and therefore they are never perfect, but You are above the jurisdiction of all material conceptions. Your name, form and qualities are all transcendental and beyond the conception of experimental knowledge. Indeed, who can conceive of You? In the material world we can perceive only material names and qualities. We have no other power than to offer our respectful obeisances and prayers unto You, the transcendental person. The chanting of Your auspicious transcendental qualities will wipe out the sins of all mankind. That is the most auspicious activity for us, and we can thus partially understand Your supernatural position.

All of life's goals and opulences are directly, self-sufficiently, unceasingly and unlimitedly increasing in You at every moment. Indeed, You are unlimited enjoyment and blissful existence itself. As far as we are concerned, O Lord, we are always after material enjoyment. You do not need all these sacrificial arrangements, but they are meant for us so that we may be benedicted by Your Lordship. All these sacrifices are performed for our fruitive results, and they are not actually needed by You.

O Lord of lords, we are completely ignorant of the execution of dharma, artha, käma and mokña, the process of liberation, because we do not actually know the goal of life. You have appeared personally before us like a person soliciting worship, but actually You are present here just so we can see You. You have come out of Your abundant and causeless mercy in order to serve our purpose, our interest, and give us the benefit of Your personal glory called apavarga, liberation. You have come, although You are not properly worshiped by us due to our ignorance.

Dear Lord, all the great sages who are thoughtful and saintly persons incessantly recount Your spiritual qualities. These sages have already burned up all the unlimited dirty things and, by the fire of knowledge, strengthened their detachment from the material world. Thus they have attained Your qualities and are self-satisfied. Yet even for those who feel spiritual bliss in chanting Your attributes, Your personal presence is very rare.

Please help us remember You and utter Your holy names, attributes and activities, which can dispel all the reactions of our sinful lives.

Dear Lord, here is the great King Näbhi, whose ultimate goal in life is to have a son like You. Your Lordship, his position is like that of a person approaching a very rich man and begging for a little grain. Mahäräja Näbhi is so desirous of having a son that he is worshiping You for a son, although You can offer him any exalted position, including elevation to the heavenly planets or liberation back to Godhead.

No one can see the path of this material energy or tell how it is working.

O Lord, You perform many wonderful activities. Our only aim was to acquire a son by performing this great sacrifice; therefore our intelligence is not very sharp. We are not experienced in ascertaining life's goal. By inviting You to this negligible sacrifice for some material motive, we have certainly committed a great offense at Your lotus feet. Therefore, O Lord of lords, please excuse our offense because of Your causeless mercy and equal mind.

O my Lord, You are the only worshipable person, for You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all opulences. Your secure lotus feet are the only source of protection for all Your devotees, whom You satisfy by manifesting Yourself in various forms. O my Lord, You deliver Your devotees from the clutches of material existence. Nondevotees, however, remain entangled in material existence by Your will. Kindly accept me as Your eternal servant.

We cannot control the force of our anger. Therefore when we look at material things, we cannot avoid feeling attraction or repulsion for them. But the Supreme Lord is never affected in this way. Although He glances over the material world for the purpose of creating, maintaining and destroying it, He is not affected, even to the slightest degree. Therefore, one who desires to conquer the force of the senses must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Then he will be victorious.

asat-dåçaù—for a person with polluted vision; yaù—who; pratibhäti—appears; mäyayä—the influence of mäyä; kñébaù—one who is inebriated or angry; iva—like; madhu—by honey; äsava—and liquor; tämra-locanaù—having eyes reddish like copper; na—not; näga-vadhvaù—the wives of the serpent demon; arhaëe—in worshiping; éçire—were unable to proceed; hriyä—because of bashfulness; yat-pädayoù—of whose lotus feet; sparçana—by the touching; dharñita—agitated; indriyäù—whose senses.
For persons with impure vision, the Supreme Lord's eyes appear like those of someone who indiscriminately drinks intoxicating beverages. Thus bewildered, such unintelligent persons become angry at the Supreme Lord, and due to their angry mood the Lord Himself appears angry and very fearful. However, this is an illusion. When the wives of the serpent demon were agitated by the touch of the Lord's lotus feet, due to shyness they could proceed no further in their worship of Him. Yet the Lord remained unagitated by their touch, for He is equipoised in all circumstances. Therefore who will not worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead?

yam—whom; ähuù—they said; asya—of the material world; sthiti—the maintenance; janma—creation; saàyamam—annihilation; tribhiù—these three; vihénam—without; yam—which; anantam—unlimited; èñayaù—all the great sages; na—not; veda—feels; siddha-artham—a mustard seed; iva—like; kvacit—where; sthitam—situated; bhü-maëòalam—the universe; mürdha-sahasra-dhämasu—on the hundreds and thousands of hoods of the Lord.
Lord Çiva continued: All the great sages accept the Lord as the source of creation, maintenance and destruction, although He actually has nothing to do with these activities. Therefore the Lord is called unlimited. Although the Lord in His incarnation as Çeña holds all the universes on His hoods, each universe feels no heavier than a mustard seed to Him. Therefore, what person desiring perfection will not worship the Lord?

From that Supreme Personality of Godhead appears Lord Brahmä, whose body is made from the total material energy, the reservoir of intelligence predominated by the passionate mode of material nature. From Lord Brahmä, I myself am born as a representation of false ego known as Rudra. By my own power I create all the other demigods, the five elements and the senses. Therefore, I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than any of us and under whose control are situated all the demigods, material elements and senses, and even Lord Brahmä and I myself, like birds bound by a rope. Only by the Lord's grace can we create, maintain and annihilate the material world. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Being.

The illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all of us conditioned souls to this material world. Therefore, without being favored by Him, persons like us cannot understand how to get out of that illusory energy. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who is the cause of creation and annihilation.

The ruler Bhadraçravä and his intimate associates utter the following prayer: We offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all religious principles, who cleanses the heart of the conditioned soul in this material world.

Alas! How wonderful it is that the foolish materialist does not heed the great danger of impending death! He knows that death will surely come, yet he is nevertheless callous and neglectful. If his father dies, he wants to enjoy his father's property, and if his son dies, he wants to enjoy his son's possessions as well. In either case, he heedlessly tries to enjoy material happiness with the acquired money.

O unborn one, learned Vedic scholars who are advanced in spiritual knowledge certainly know that this material world is perishable, as do other logicians and philosophers. In trance they realize the factual position of this world, and they preach the truth as well. Yet even they are sometimes bewildered by Your illusory energy. This is Your own wonderful pastime. Therefore, I can understand that Your illusory energy is very wonderful, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

viçva—of the whole universe; udbhava—of the creation; sthäna—of the maintenance; nirodha—of the annihilation; karma—these activities; te—of You (O dear Lord); hi—indeed; akartuù—aloof; aìgékåtam—still accepted by the Vedic literature; api—although; apävåtaù—untouched by all these activities; yuktam—befitting; na—not; citram—wonderful; tvayi—in You; kärya-käraëe—the original cause of all effects; sarva-ätmani—in all respects; vyatirikte—set apart; ca—also; vastutaù—the original substance.
O Lord, although You are completely detached from the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world and are not directly affected by these activities, they are all attributed to You. We do not wonder at this, for Your inconceivable energies perfectly qualify You to be the cause of all causes. You are the active principle in everything, although You are separate from everything. Thus we can realize that everything is happening because of Your inconceivable energy.

At the end of the millennium, ignorance personified assumed the form of a demon, stole all the Vedas and took them down to the planet of Rasätala. The Supreme Lord, however, in His form of Hayagréva retrieved the Vedas and returned them to Lord Brahmä when he begged for them. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, whose determination never fails.

Please appear in our hearts and drive away our ignorance so that by Your mercy we may become fearless in the struggle for existence in this material world.

May there be good fortune throughout the universe, and may all envious persons be pacified. May all living entities become calm by practicing bhakti-yoga, for by accepting devotional service they will think of each other's welfare. Therefore let us all engage in the service of the supreme transcendence, Lord Çré Kåñëa, and always remain absorbed in thought of Him.

My dear Lord, we pray that we may never feel attraction for the prison of family life, consisting of home, wife, children, friends, bank balance, relatives and so on. If we do have some attachment, let it be for devotees, whose only dear friend is Kåñëa. A person who is actually self-realized and who has controlled his mind is perfectly satisfied with the bare necessities of life. He does not try to gratify his senses. Such a person quickly advances in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas others, who are too attached to material things, find advancement very difficult.

yat—of whom (the devotees); saìga-labdham—achieved by the association; nija-vérya-vaibhavam—whose influence is uncommon; tértham—holy places like the Ganges; muhuù—repeatedly; saàspåçatäm—of those touching; hi—certainly; mänasam—the dirty things in the mind; harati—vanquishes; ajaù—the supreme unborn one; antaù—in the core of the heart; çrutibhiù—by the ears; gataù—entered; aìga-jam—dirty things or infections of the body; kaù—who; vai—indeed; na—not; seveta—would serve; mukunda-vikramam—the glorious activities of Mukunda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
By associating with persons for whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, is the all in all, one can hear of His powerful activities and soon come to understand them. The activities of Mukunda are so potent that simply by hearing of them one immediately associates with the Lord. For a person who constantly and very eagerly hears narrations of the Lord's powerful activities, the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead in the form of sound vibrations, enters within his heart and cleanses it of all contamination. On the other hand, although bathing in the Ganges diminishes bodily contaminations and infections, this process and the process of visiting holy places can cleanse the heart only after a long time. Therefore who is the sane man who will not associate with devotees to quickly perfect his life?

yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä

yasya—of whom; asti—there is; bhaktiù—devotional service; bhagavati—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; akiïcanä—without any motive; sarvaiù—with all; guëaiù—good qualities; tatra—there (in that person); samäsate—reside; suräù—all the demigods; harau—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; abhaktasya—of a person who is not devoted; kutaù—where; mahat-guëäù—good qualities; manorathena—by mental speculation; asati—in the temporary material world; dhävataù—who is running; bahiù—outside.
All the demigods and their exalted qualities, such as religion, knowledge and renunciation, become manifest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?

hariù—the Lord; hi—certainly; säkñät—directly; bhagavän—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; çarériëäm—of all living entities who have accepted material bodies; ätmä—the life and soul; jhañäëäm—of the aquatics; iva—like; toyam—the vast water; épsitam—is desired; hitvä—giving up; mahän—a great personality; tam—Him; yadi—if; sajjate—becomes attached; gåhe—to household life; tadä—at that time; mahattvam—greatness; vayasä—by age; dam-paténäm—of the husband and wife.
Just as aquatics always desire to remain in the vast mass of water, all conditioned living entities naturally desire to remain in the vast existence of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if someone very great by material calculations fails to take shelter of the Supreme Soul but instead becomes attached to material household life, his greatness is like that of a young, low-class couple. One who is too attached to material life loses all good spiritual qualities.

Therefore, O demons, give up the so-called happiness of family life and simply take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nåsiàhadeva, which are the actual shelter of fearlessness. Entanglement in family life is the root cause of material attachment, indefatigable desires, moroseness, anger, despair, fear and the desire for false prestige, all of which result in the repetition of birth and death.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Håñékeça, the controller of all my senses and the origin of everything. As the supreme master of all bodily, mental and intellectual activities, He is the only enjoyer of their results. The five sense objects and eleven senses, including the mind, are His partial manifestations. He supplies all the necessities of life, which are His energy and thus nondifferent from Him, and He is the cause of everyone's bodily and mental prowess, which is also nondifferent from Him. Indeed, He is the husband and provider of necessities for all living entities. The purpose of all the Vedas is to worship Him. Therefore let us all offer Him our respectful obeisances. May He always be favorable toward us in this life and the next.

My dear Lord, You are certainly the fully independent master of all the senses. Therefore all women who worship You by strictly observing vows because they wish to acquire a husband to satisfy their senses are surely under illusion. They do not know that such a husband cannot actually give protection to them or their children. Nor can he protect their wealth or duration of life, for he himself is dependent on time, fruitive results and the modes of nature, which are all subordinate to You.

He alone who is never afraid but who, on the contrary, gives complete shelter to all fearful persons can actually become a husband and protector. Therefore, my Lord, you are the only husband, and no one else can claim this position. If you were not the only husband, You would be afraid of others. Therefore persons learned in all Vedic literature accept only Your Lordship as everyone's master, and they think no one else a better husband and protector than You.

My dear Lord, You automatically fulfill all the desires of a woman who worships Your lotus feet in pure love. However, if a woman worships Your lotus feet for a particular purpose, You also quickly fulfill her desires, but in the end she becomes broken-hearted and laments. Therefore one need not worship Your lotus feet for some material benefit.

O infallible one, Your lotus palm is the source of all benediction. Therefore Your pure devotees worship it, and You very mercifully place Your hand on their heads. I wish that You may also place Your hand on My head, for although You already bear my insignia of golden streaks on Your chest, I regard this honor as merely a kind of false prestige for me. You show Your real mercy to Your devotees, not to me. Of course, You are the supreme absolute controller, and no one can understand Your motives.

I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is pure transcendence. He is the origin of all life, bodily strength, mental power and sensory ability. Known as Matsyävatära, the gigantic fish incarnation, He appears first among all the incarnations. Again I offer my obeisances unto Him.

My dear Lord, just as a puppeteer controls his dancing dolls and a husband controls his wife, Your Lordship controls all the living entities in the universe, such as the brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras. Although You are in everyone's heart as the supreme witness and commander and are outside everyone as well, the so-called leaders of societies, communities and countries cannot realize You. Only those who hear the vibration of the Vedic mantras can appreciate You.

My Lord, from the great leaders of the universe, such as Lord Brahmä and other demigods, down to the political leaders of this world, all are envious of Your authority. Without Your help, however, they could neither separately nor concertedly maintain the innumerable living entities within the universe. You are actually the only maintainer of all human beings, of animals like cows and asses, and of plants, reptiles, birds, mountains and whatever else is visible within this material world.

O almighty Lord, at the end of the millennium this planet earth, which is the source of all kinds of herbs, drugs and trees, was inundated by water and drowned beneath the devastating waves. At that time, You protected me along with the earth and roamed the sea with great speed. O unborn one, You are the actual maintainer of the entire universal creation, and therefore You are the cause of all living entities. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

O my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who have assumed the form of a tortoise. You are the reservoir of all transcendental qualities, and being entirely untinged by matter, You are perfectly situated in pure goodness. You move here and there in the water, but no one can discern Your position. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Because of Your transcendental position, You are not limited by past, present and future. You are present everywhere as the shelter of all things, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You again and again.

My dear Lord, this visible cosmic manifestation is a demonstration of Your own creative energy. Since the countless varieties of forms within this cosmic manifestation are simply a display of Your external energy, this viräö-rüpa [universal body] is not Your real form. Except for a devotee in transcendental consciousness, no one can perceive Your actual form. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My dear Lord, You manifest Your different energies in countless forms: as living entities born from wombs, from eggs and from perspiration; as plants and trees that grow out of the earth; as all living entities, both moving and standing, including the demigods, the learned sages and the pitäs; as outer space; as the higher planetary system containing the heavenly planets; and as the planet earth with its hills, rivers, seas, oceans and islands. Indeed, all the stars and planets are simply manifestations of Your different energies, but originally You are one without a second. Therefore there is nothing beyond You. This entire cosmic manifestation is therefore not false but is simply a temporary manifestation of Your inconceivable energy.

O my Lord, Your name, form and bodily features are expanded in countless forms. No one can determine exactly how many forms exist, yet You Yourself, in Your incarnation as the learned scholar Kapiladeva, have analyzed the cosmic manifestation as containing twenty-four elements. Therefore if one is interested in Säìkhya philosophy, by which one can enumerate the different truths, he must hear it from You. Unfortunately, nondevotees simply count the different elements and remain ignorant of Your actual form. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

O Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You as the gigantic person. Simply by chanting mantras, we shall be able to understand You fully. You are yajïa [sacrifice], and You are the kratu [ritual]. Therefore all the ritualistic ceremonies of sacrifice are part of Your transcendental body, and You are the only enjoyer of all sacrifices. Your form is composed of transcendental goodness. You are known as tri-yuga because in Kali-yuga You appear as a concealed incarnation and because You always fully possess the three pairs of opulences.

By manipulating a fire-generating stick, great saints and sages can bring forth the fire lying dormant within wood. In the same way, O Lord, those expert in understanding the Absolute Truth try to see You in everything—even in their own bodies. Yet you remain concealed. You are not to be understood by indirect processes involving mental or physical activities. Because You are self-manifested, only when You see that a person is wholeheartedly engaged in searching for You do You reveal Yourself. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

The objects of material enjoyment [sound, form, taste, touch and smell], the activities of the senses, the controllers of sensory activities [the demigods], the body, eternal time and egotism are all creations of Your material energy. Those whose intelligence has become fixed by perfect execution of mystic yoga can see that all these elements result from the actions of Your external energy. They can also see Your transcendental form as Supersoul in the background of everything. Therefore I repeatedly offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Your Lordship is the reservoir of all the good qualities of Äryans, people who are advanced. Your character and behavior are always consistent, and You always control Your senses and mind. Acting just like an ordinary human being, You exhibit exemplary character to teach others how to behave. There is a touchstone that can be used to examine the quality of gold, but You are like a touchstone that can verify all good qualities. You are worshiped by brähmaëas who are the foremost of all devotees. You, the Supreme Person, are the king of kings, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

The Lord, whose pure form [sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]] is uncontaminated by the modes of material nature, can be perceived by pure consciousness. In the Vedänta He is described as being one without a second. Because of His spiritual potency, He is untouched by the contamination of material nature, and because He is not subjected to material vision, He is known as transcendental. He has no material activities, nor has He a material form or name. Only in pure consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness, can one perceive the transcendental form of the Lord. Let us be firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Lord Rämacandra, and let us offer our respectful obeisances unto those transcendental lotus feet.

It was ordained that Rävaëa, chief of the Räkñasas, could not be killed by anyone but a man, and for this reason Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in the form of a human being. Lord Rämacandra's mission, however, was not only to kill Rävaëa but also to teach mortal beings that material happiness centered around sex life or centered around one's wife is the cause of many miseries. He is the self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, and nothing is lamentable for Him. Therefore why else could He be subjected to tribulations by the kidnapping of mother Sétä?

Since Lord Çré Rämacandra is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, He is not attached to anything in this material world. He is the most beloved Supersoul of all self-realized souls, and He is their very intimate friend. He is full of all opulences. Therefore He could not possibly have suffered because of separation from His wife, nor could He have given up His wife and Lakñmaëa, His younger brother. To give up either would have been absolutely impossible.

One cannot establish a friendship with the Supreme Lord Rämacandra on the basis of material qualities such as one's birth in an aristocratic family, one's personal beauty, one's eloquence, one's sharp intelligence or one's superior race or nation. None of these qualifications is actually a prerequisite for friendship with Lord Çré Rämacandra. Otherwise how is it possible that although we uncivilized inhabitants of the forest have not taken noble births, although we have no physical beauty and although we cannot speak like gentlemen, Lord Rämacandra has nevertheless accepted us as friends?

Therefore, whether one is a demigod or a demon, a man or a creature other than man, such as a beast or bird, everyone should worship Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears on this earth just like a human being. There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship the Lord, for He accepts even a small service offered by His devotee. Thus He is satisfied, and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee is successful. Indeed, Lord Çré Rämacandra brought all the devotees of Ayodhyä back home, back to Godhead [Vaikuëöha].

Although to the foolish He appears to have accepted a material body like us, He is unaffected by bodily tribulations like hunger, thirst and fatigue. Although He is the witness who sees everything, His senses are unpolluted by the objects He sees. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that unattached, pure witness of the world, the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead.

idam—this; hi—certainly; yoga-éçvara—O my Lord, master of all mystic power; yoga-naipuëam—the expert process of executing yogic principles; hiraëya-garbhaù—Lord Brahmä; bhagavän—the most powerful; jagäda—spoke; yat—which; yat—which; anta-käle—at the time of death; tvayi—in You; nirguëe—the transcendence; manaù—the mind; bhaktyä—with a devotional attitude; dadhéta—one should place; ujjhita-duñkalevaraù—having given up his identification with the material body.
O my Lord, master of all mystic yoga, this is the explanation of the yogic process spoken of by Lord Brahmä [Hiraëyagarbha], who is self-realized. At the time of death, all yogés give up the material body with full detachment simply by placing their minds at Your lotus feet. That is the perfection of yoga.

yathaihikämuñmika-käma-lampaöaù
suteñu däreñu dhaneñu cintayan
çaìketa vidvän kukalevarätyayäd
yas tasya yatnaù çrama eva kevalam
yathä—as; aihika—in the present life; amuñmika—in the expected future life; käma-lampaöaù—a person who is very attached to lusty desires for bodily enjoyment; suteñu—children; däreñu—wife; dhaneñu—wealth; cintayan—thinking about; çaìketa—is afraid; vidvän—a person advanced in spiritual knowledge; ku-kalevara—of this body, which is full of stool and urine; atyayät—because of loss; yaù—anyone; tasya—his; yatnaù—endeavors; çramaù—a waste of time and energy; eva—certainly; kevalam—only.
Materialists are generally very attached to their present bodily comforts and to the bodily comforts they expect in the future. Therefore they are always absorbed in thoughts of their wives, children and wealth and are afraid of giving up their bodies, which are full of stool and urine. If a person engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, however, is also afraid of giving up his body, what is the use of his having labored to study the çästras? It was simply a waste of time.

tat—therefore; naù—our; prabho—O my Lord; tvam—You; ku-kalevara-arpitäm—invested in this bad body full of stool and urine; tvat-mäyayä—by Your illusory energy; aham-mamatäm—the conception of "I and my"; adhokñaja—O Transcendence; bhindyäma—may give up; yena—by which; äçu—very soon; vayam—we; sudurbhidäm—which is very difficult to give up; vidhehi—please give; yogam—the mystic process; tvayi—unto You; naù—our; svabhävam—which is symptomized by a steady mind; iti—thus.
Therefore, O Lord, O Transcendence, kindly help us by giving us the power to execute bhakti-yoga so that we can control our restless minds and fix them upon You. We are all infected by Your illusory energy; therefore we are very attached to the body, which is full of stool and urine, and to anything related with the body. Except for devotional service, there is no way to give up this attachment. Therefore kindly bestow upon us this benediction.
Song_Demigods Glorification of Birth in Bhārata-varsa (SB 5.19.21-27)

etad eva hi devä gäyanti—
aho améñäà kim akäri çobhanaà
prasanna eñäà svid uta svayaà hariù
yair janma labdhaà nåñu bhäratäjire
mukunda-sevaupayikaà spåhä hi naù
etat—this; eva—indeed; hi—certainly; deväù—all the demigods; gäyanti—chant; aho—oh; améñäm—of these inhabitants of Bhärata-varña; kim—what; akäri—was done; çobhanam—pious, beautiful activities; prasannaù—pleased; eñäm—upon them; svit—or; uta—it is said; svayam—personally; hariù—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; yaiù—by whom; janma—birth; labdham—obtained; nåñu—in human society; bhärata-ajire—in the courtyard of Bhärata-varña; mukunda—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can offer liberation; sevä-aupayikam—which is the means of serving; spåhä—desire; hi—indeed; naù—our.
Since the human form of life is the sublime position for spiritual realization, all the demigods in heaven speak in this way: How wonderful it is for these human beings to have been born in the land of Bhärata-varña. They must have executed pious acts of austerity in the past, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself must have been pleased with them. Otherwise, how could they engage in devotional service in so many ways? We demigods can only aspire to achieve human births in Bhärata-varña to execute devotional service, but these human beings are already engaged there.

kim—what is the value; duñkaraiù—very difficult to perform; naù—our; kratubhiù—with performances of sacrifice; tapaù—with austerities; vrataiù—vows; däna-ädibhiù—with executing charitable activities and so on; vä—or; dyujayena—with achieving the heavenly kingdom; phalgunä—which is insignificant; na—no; yatra—where; näräyaëa-päda-paìkaja—of the lotus feet of Lord Näräyaëa; småtiù—the remembrance; pramuñöa—lost; atiçaya—excessive; indriya-utsavät—due to material sense gratification.
The demigods continue: After performing the very difficult tasks of executing Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, undergoing austerities, observing vows and giving charity, we have achieved this position as inhabitants of the heavenly planets. But what is the value of this achievement? Here we are certainly very engaged in material sense gratification, and therefore we can hardly remember the lotus feet of Lord Näräyaëa. Indeed, because of our excessive sense gratification, we have almost forgotten His lotus feet.

kalpäyuñäà sthänajayät punar-bhavät
kñaëäyuñäà bhärata-bhüjayo varam
kñaëena martyena kåtaà manasvinaù
sannyasya saàyänty abhayaà padaà hareù
kalpa-äyuñäm—of those who have a life duration of many millions of years, like Lord Brahmä; sthäna-jayät—than achievement of the place or planetary systems; punaù-bhavät—which is liable to birth, death and old age; kñaëa-äyuñäm—of persons who have only one hundred years of life; bhärata-bhü-jayaù—a birth in the land of Bhärata-varña; varam—more valuable; kñaëena—for such a short life; martyena—by the body; kåtam—the work executed; manasvinaù—those actually understanding the value of life; sannyasya—surrendering unto the lotus feet of Kåñëa; saàyänti—they achieve; abhayam—where there is no anxiety; padam—the abode; hareù—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
A short life in the land of Bharata-varña is preferable to a life achieved in Brahmaloka for millions and billions of years because even if one is elevated to Brahmaloka he must return to repeated birth and death. Although life in Bhärata-varña, in a lower planetary system, is very short, one who lives there can elevate himself to full Kåñëa consciousness and achieve the highest perfection, even in this short life, by fully surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Thus one attains Vaikuëöhaloka, where there is neither anxiety nor repeated birth in a material body.

na—not; yatra—where; vaikuëöha-kathä-sudhä-äpagäù—the nectarean rivers of discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is called Vaikuëöha, or one who drives away all anxiety; na—nor; sädhavaù—devotees; bhägavatäù—always engaged in the service of the Lord; tat-äçrayäù—who are sheltered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; na—nor; yatra—where; yajïa-éça-makhäù—the performance of devotional service to the Lord of sacrifices; mahä-utsaväù—which are actual festivals; sureça-lokaù—a place inhabited by the denizens of heaven; api—although; na—not; vai—certainly; saù—that; sevyatäm—be frequented.
An intelligent person does not take interest in a place, even in the topmost planetary system, if the pure Ganges of topics concerning the Supreme Lord's activities does not flow there, if there are not devotees engaged in service on the banks of such a river of piety, or if there are no festivals of saìkértana-yajïa to satisfy the Lord [especially since saìkértana-yajïa is recommended in this age].

präptäù—who have obtained; nå-jätim—a birth in human society; tu—certainly; iha—in this land of Bhärata-varña; ye—those who; ca—also; jantavaù—the living beings; jïäna—with knowledge; kriyä—with activities; dravya—of ingredients; kaläpa—with a collection; sambhåtäm—full; na—not; vai—certainly; yateran—endeavor; apunaù-bhaväya—for the position of immortality; te—such persons; bhüyaù—again; vanaukäù—birds; iva—like; yänti—go; bandhanam—to bondage.
Bhärata-varña offers the proper land and circumstances in which to execute devotional service, which can free one from the results of jïäna and karma. If one obtains a human body in the land of Bhärata-varña, with clear sensory organs with which to execute the saìkértana-yajïa, but in spite of this opportunity he does not take to devotional service, he is certainly like liberated forest animals and birds that are careless and are therefore again bound by a hunter.

yaiù—by whom (the inhabitants of Bhärata-varña); çraddhayä—faith and confidence; barhiñi—in the performance of Vedic ritualistic sacrifices; bhägaçaù—by division; haviù—oblations; niruptam—offered; iñöam—to the desired deity; vidhi—by the proper method; mantra—by reciting mantras; vastutaù—with the proper ingredients; ekaù—that one Supreme Personality of Godhead; påthak—separate; nämabhiù—by names; ähutaù—called; mudä—with great happiness; gåhëäti—He accepts; pürëaù—the Supreme Lord, who is full in Himself; svayam—personally; äçiñäm—of all benedictions; prabhuù—the bestower.
In India [Bhärata-varña], there are many worshipers of the demigods, the various officials appointed by the Supreme Lord, such as Indra, Candra and Sürya, all of whom are worshiped differently. The worshipers offer the demigods their oblations, considering the demigods part and parcel of the whole, the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts these offerings and gradually raises the worshipers to the real standard of devotional service by fulfilling their desires and aspirations. Because the Lord is complete, He offers the worshipers the benedictions they desire even if they worship only part of His transcendental body.

satyam—certainly; diçati—He offers; arthitam—the object prayed for; arthitaù—being prayed to; nåëäm—by the human beings; na—not; eva—indeed; artha-daù—the bestower of benedictions; yat—which; punaù—again; arthitä—a demand for a benediction; yataù—from which; svayam—personally; vidhatte—He gives; bhajatäm—unto those engaged in His service; anicchatäm—although not desiring it; icchä-pidhänam—which covers all desirable things; nija-päda-pallavam—His own lotus feet.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead fulfills the material desires of a devotee who approaches Him with such motives, but He does not bestow benedictions upon the devotee that will cause him to demand more benedictions again. However, the Lord willingly gives the devotee shelter at His own lotus feet, even though such a person does not aspire for it, and that shelter satisfies all his desires. That is the Supreme Personality's special mercy.

çré-prajäpatiù uväca—the prajäpati Dakña said; namaù—all respectful obeisances; paräya—unto the Transcendence; avitatha—correct; anubhütaye—unto Him whose spiritual potency brings about realization of Him; guëa-traya—of the three material modes of nature; äbhäsa—of the living entities who have the appearance; nimitta—and of the material energy; bandhave—unto the controller; adåñöa-dhämne—who is not perceived in His abode; guëa-tattva-buddhibhiù—by the conditioned souls whose poor intelligence dictates that real truth is found in the manifestations of the three modes of material nature; nivåtta-mänäya—who has surpassed all material measurements and calculations; dadhe—I offer; svayambhuve—unto the Supreme Lord, who is manifest with no cause.
Prajäpati Dakña said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the illusory energy and the physical categories it produces. He possesses the potency for unfailing knowledge and supreme willpower, and He is the controller of the living entities and the illusory energy. The conditioned souls who have accepted this material manifestation as everything cannot see Him, for He is above the evidence of experimental knowledge. Self-evident and self-sufficient, He is not caused by any superior cause. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

As the sense objects [form, taste, touch, smell and sound] cannot understand how the senses perceive them, so the conditioned soul, although residing in his body along with the Supersoul, cannot understand how the supreme spiritual person, the master of the material creation, directs his senses. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Person, who is the supreme controller.

dehaù—this body; asavaù—the life airs; akñäù—the different senses; manavaù—the mind, understanding, intellect and ego; bhüta-mäträm—the five gross material elements and the sense objects (form, taste, sound and so on); ätmänam—themselves; anyam—any other; ca—and; viduù—know; param—beyond; yat—that which; sarvam—everything; pumän—the living being; veda—knows; guëän—the qualities of the material nature; ca—and; tat-jïaù—knowing those things; na—not; veda—knows; sarva-jïam—unto the omniscient; anantam—the unlimited; éòe—I offer my respectful obeisances.
Because they are only matter, the body, the life airs, the external and internal senses, the five gross elements and the subtle sense objects [form, taste, smell, sound and touch] cannot know their own nature, the nature of the other senses or the nature of their controllers. But the living being, because of his spiritual nature, can know his body, the life airs, the senses, the elements and the sense objects, and he can also know the three qualities that form their roots. Nevertheless, although the living being is completely aware of them, he is unable to see the Supreme Being, who is omniscient and unlimited. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

yadä—when in trance; uparämaù—complete cessation; manasaù—of the mind; näma-rüpa—material names and forms; rüpasya—of that by which they appear; dåñöa—of material vision; småti—and of remembrance; sampramoñät—due to the destruction; yaù—who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); éyate—is perceived; kevalayä—with spiritual; sva-saàsthayä—His own original form; haàsäya—unto the supreme pure; tasmai—unto Him; çuci-sadmane—who is realized only in the pure state of spiritual existence; namaù—I offer my respectful obeisances.
When one's consciousness is completely purified of the contamination of material existence, gross and subtle, without being agitated as in the working and dreaming states, and when the mind is not dissolved as in suñupti, deep sleep, one comes to the platform of trance. Then one's material vision and the memories of the mind, which manifests names and forms, are vanquished. Only in such a trance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead revealed. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seen in that uncontaminated, transcendental state.

manéñiëaù—great learned brähmaëas performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices; antaù-hådi—within the core of the heart; sanniveçitam—being situated; sva-çaktibhiù—with His own spiritual potencies; navabhiù—also with the nine different material potencies (the material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of the senses); ca—and (the five gross material elements and the ten acting and knowledge-gathering senses); trivådbhiù—by the three material modes of nature; vahnim—fire; yathä—just like; däruëi—within wood; päïcadaçyam—produced by chanting the fifteen hymns known as Sämidhené mantras; manéñayä—by purified intelligence; niñkarñanti—extract; güòham—although not manifesting; saù—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; vai—indeed; mama—toward me; açeña—all; viçeña—varieties; mäyä—of the illusory energy; niñedha—by the process of negation; nirväëa—of liberation; sukha-anubhütiù—who is realized by transcendental bliss; saù—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva-nämä—who is the source of all names; saù—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; ca—also; viçva-rüpaù—the gigantic form of the universe; prasédatäm—may He be merciful; anirukta—inconceivable; ätma-çaktiù—the reservoir of all spiritual potencies.
Just as great learned brähmaëas who are expert in performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices can extract the fire dormant within wooden fuel by chanting the fifteen Sämidhené mantras, thus proving the efficacy of the Vedic mantras, so those who are actually advanced in consciousness—in other words, those who are Kåñëa conscious—can find the Supersoul, who by His own spiritual potency is situated within the heart. The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements [material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification], and also by the five material elements and the ten senses. These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy of the Lord. Great yogés meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Paramätmä, within the core of the heart. May that Supersoul be pleased with me. The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life. One actually attains such liberation when he engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of service. The Lord may be addressed by various spiritual names, which are inconceivable to the material senses. When will that Supreme Personality of Godhead be pleased with me?

yat yat—whatever; niruktam—expressed; vacasä—by words; nirüpitam—ascertained; dhiyä—by so-called meditation or intelligence; akñabhiù—by the senses; vä—or; manasä—by the mind; uta—certainly; yasya—of whom; mä bhüt—may not be; sva-rüpam—the actual form of the Lord; guëa-rüpam—consisting of the three qualities; hi—indeed; tat tat—that; saù—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; vai—indeed; guëa-apäya—the cause of the annihilation of everything made of the material modes of nature; visarga—and the creation; lakñaëaù—appearing as.
Anything expressed by material vibrations, anything ascertained by material intelligence and anything experienced by the material senses or concocted within the material mind is but an effect of the modes of material nature and therefore has nothing to do with the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the material qualities and creation. As the cause of all causes, He exists before the creation and after the creation. I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.

yasmin—in whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the supreme place of repose); yataù—from whom (everything emanates); yena—by whom (everything is enacted); ca—also; yasya—to whom everything belongs; yasmai—to whom (everything is offered); yat—which; yaù—who; yathä—as; kurute—executes; käryate—is performed; ca—also; para-avareñäm—of both, in the material and spiritual existence; paramam—the supreme; präk—the origin; prasiddham—well known to everyone; tat—that; brahma—the Supreme Brahman; tat hetuù—the cause of all causes; ananyat—having no other cause; ekam—one without a second.
The Supreme Brahman, Kåñëa, is the ultimate resting place and source of everything. Everything is done by Him, everything belongs to Him, and everything is offered to Him. He is the ultimate objective, and whether acting or causing others to act, He is the ultimate doer. There are many causes, high and low, but since He is the cause of all causes, He is well known as the Supreme Brahman who existed before all activities. He is one without a second and has no other cause. I therefore offer my respects unto Him.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who possesses unlimited transcendental qualities. Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all philosophers, who propagate various views, He causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves. Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.

asti—there is; iti—thus; na—not; asti—there is; iti—thus; ca—and; vastu-niñöhayoù—professing knowledge of the ultimate cause; eka-sthayoù—with one and the same subject matter, establishing Brahman; bhinna—demonstrating different; viruddha-dharmaëoù—and opposing characteristics; avekñitam—perceived; kiïcana—that something which; yoga-säìkhyayoù—of mystic yoga and the Säìkhya philosophy (analysis of the ways of nature); samam—the same; param—transcendental; hi—indeed; anukülam—dwelling place; båhat tat—that ultimate cause.
There are two parties—namely, the theists and the atheists. The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds the spiritual cause through mystic yoga. The Säìkhyite, however, who merely analyzes the material elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause—whether Bhagavän, Paramätmä or even Brahman. Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external activities of material nature. Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because although they offer opposing statements their object is the same ultimate cause. They are both approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is inconceivably opulent, who is devoid of all material names, forms and pastimes, and who is all-pervading, is especially merciful to the devotees who worship His lotus feet. Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to me.

As the air carries various characteristics of the physical elements, like the aroma of a flower or colors resulting from a mixture of dust in the air, the Lord appears through lower systems of worship according to one's desires, although He appears as the demigods and not in His original form. What is the use of these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.

The demigods said: The three worlds are created by the five elements—namely ether, air, fire, water and earth—which are controlled by various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahmä. Being very much afraid that the time factor will end our existence, we offer presentations unto time by performing our work as time dictates. The time factor himself, however, is afraid of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore let us now worship that Supreme Lord, who alone can give us full protection.

avismitam—who is never struck with wonder; tam—Him; paripürëa-kämam—who is fully satisfied; svena—by His own; eva—indeed; läbhena—achievements; samam—equipoised; praçäntam—very steady; vinä—without; upasarpati—approaches; aparam—another; hi—indeed; bäliçaù—a fool; çva—of a dog; läìgulena—by the tail; atititarti—wants to cross; sindhum—the sea.
Free from all material conceptions of existence and never wonder-struck by anything, the Lord is always jubilant and fully satisfied by His own spiritual perfection. He has no material designations, and therefore He is steady and unattached. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter of everyone. Anyone desiring to be protected by others is certainly a great fool who desires to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog.

yasya—of whom; uru—very strong and high; çåìge—on the horn; jagatém—in the form of the world; sva-nävam—his own boat; manuù—Manu, King Satyavrata; yathä—just as; äbadhya—binding; tatära—crossed; durgam—the very difficult to cross (inundation); saù—He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva—certainly; naù—us; tväñöra-bhayät—from fear of the son of Tvañöä; durantät—endless; trätä—deliverer; äçritän—dependents (like us); väri-caraù api—although taking the form of a fish; nünam—indeed.
The Manu named King Satyavrata formerly saved himself by tying the small boat of the entire world to the horn of the Matsya avatära, the fish incarnation. By the grace of the Matsya avatära, Manu saved himself from the great danger of the flood. May that same fish incarnation save us from the great and fearful danger caused by the son of Tvañöä.

purä—formerly (during the time of creation); svayambhüù—Lord Brahmä; api—also; saàyama-ambhasi—in the water of inundation; udérëa—very high; väta—of wind; ürmi—and of waves; ravaiù—by the sounds; karäle—very fearful; ekaù—alone; aravindät—from the lotus seat; patitaù—almost fallen; tatära—escaped; tasmät—from that; bhayät—fearful situation; yena—by whom (the Lord); saù—He; naù—of us; astu—let there be; päraù—deliverance.
In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water. The great waves made such a horrible sound that Lord Brahmä almost fell from his seat on the lotus into the water of devastation, but he was saved with the help of the Lord. Thus we also expect the Lord to protect us from this dangerous condition.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created us by His external potency and by whose mercy we expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods.

By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various transcendental bodies as Vämanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Paraçuräma, the incarnation among saints; Nåsiàhadeva and Varäha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kürma, incarnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Kåñëa and Lord Räma. By His causeless mercy, He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons. He is the supreme worshipable Deity of all living entities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [viräö-rüpa]. In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give us His protection.

çré-deväù ücuù—the demigods said; namaù—obeisances; te—unto You; yajïa-véryäya—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is able to give the results of sacrifice; vayase—who is the time factor, which ends the results of yajïa; uta—although; te—unto You; namaù—obeisances; namaù—obeisances; te—unto You; hi—indeed; asta-cakräya—who throws the disc; namaù—respectful obeisances; supuru-hütaye—having varieties of transcendental names.
The demigods said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are competent to give the results of sacrifice, and You are also the time factor that destroys all such results in due course. You are the one who releases the cakra to kill the demons. O Lord, who possess many varieties of names, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

yat—which; te—of You; gaténäm tisåëäm—of the three destinations (the heavenly planets, the earthly planets and hell); éçituù—who are the controller; paramam padam—the supreme abode, Vaikuëöhaloka; na—not; arväcénaù—a person appearing after; visargasya—the creation; dhätaù—O supreme controller; veditum—to understand; arhati—is able.
O supreme controller, You control the three destinations [promotion to the heavenly planets, birth as a human being, and condemnation in hell], yet Your supreme abode is Vaikuëöha-dhäma. Since we appeared after You created this cosmic manifestation, Your activities are impossible for us to understand. We therefore have nothing to offer You but our humble obeisances.

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Näräyaëa, O Väsudeva, original person! O most exalted person, supreme experience, welfare personified! O supreme benediction, supremely merciful and changeless! O support of the cosmic manifestation, sole proprietor of all planetary systems, master of everything and husband of the goddess of fortune! Your Lordship is realized by the topmost sannyäsés, who wander about the world to preach Kåñëa consciousness, fully absorbed in samädhi through bhakti-yoga. Because their minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive the conception of Your personality in their fully purified hearts. When the darkness in their hearts is completely eradicated and You are revealed to them, the transcendental bliss they enjoy is the transcendental form of Your Lordship. No one but such persons can realize You. Therefore we simply offer You our respectful obeisances.

duravabodhaù—difficult to understand; iva—quite; tava—Your; ayam—this; vihära-yogaù—engagement in the pastimes of material creation, maintenance and annihilation; yat—which; açaraëaù—not dependent on any other support; açaréraù—without having a material body; idam—this; anavekñita—without waiting for; asmat—of us; samaväyaù—the cooperation; ätmanä—by Your own self; eva—indeed; avikriyamäëena—without being transformed; sa-guëam—the material modes of nature; aguëaù—although transcendental to such material qualities; såjasi—You create; päsi—maintain; harasi—annihilate.
O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation from us. Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself. Nevertheless, although You appear engaged in material activity, You are transcendental to all material qualities. Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.

atha—therefore; tatra—in that; bhavän—Your Lordship; kim—whether; deva-datta-vat—like an ordinary human being, forced by the fruits of his activities; iha—in this material world; guëa-visarga-patitaù—fallen in a material body impelled by the modes of material nature; päratantryeëa—by dependence on the conditions of time, space, activity and nature; sva-kåta—executed by oneself; kuçala—auspicious; akuçalam—inauspicious; phalam—results of action; upädadäti—accepts; ähosvit—or; ätmärämaù—completely self-satisfied; upaçama-çélaù—self-controlled in nature; samaïjasa-darçanaù—not deprived of full spiritual potencies; udäste—remains neutral as the witness; iti—thus; ha väva—certainly; na vidämaù—we do not understand.
These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus receives the fruits of his actions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual position.

na—not; hi—certainly; virodhaù—contradiction; ubhayam—both; bhagavati—in the Supreme Personality of Godhead; aparimita—unlimited; guëa-gaëe—whose transcendental attributes; éçvare—in the supreme controller; anavagähya—possessing; mähätmye—unfathomable ability and glories; arväcéna—recent; vikalpa—full of equivocal calculations; vitarka—opposing arguments; vicära—judgments; pramäëa-äbhäsa—imperfect evidence; kutarka—useless arguments; çästra—by unauthorized scriptures; kalila—agitated; antaùkaraëa—minds; äçraya—whose shelter; duravagraha—with wicked obstinacies; vädinäm—of theorists; viväda—of the controversies; anavasare—not within the range; uparata—withdrawn; samasta—from whom all; mäyä-maye—illusory energy; kevale—without a second; eva—indeed; ätma-mäyäm—the illusory energy, which can do and undo the inconceivable; antardhäya—placing between; kaù—what; nu—indeed; arthaù—meaning; durghaöaù—impossible; iva—as it were; bhavati—is; sva-rüpa—natures; dvaya—of two; abhävät—due to the absence.
O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress, are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.

sama—equal or proper; viñama—and unequal or mistaken; maténäm—of those having intelligence; matam—conclusion; anusarasi—You follow; yathä—just as; rajju-khaëòaù—a piece of rope; sarpa-ädi—a snake, etc.; dhiyäm—of those who perceive.
A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a snake, but not for a person with proper intelligence who knows it to be only a rope. Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone's heart, inspire fear or fearlessness according to one's intelligence, but in You there is no duality.

saù—He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva—indeed; hi—certainly; punaù—again; sarva-vastuni—in everything, material and spiritual; vastu-svarüpaù—the substance; sarva-éçvaraù—the controller of everything; sakala-jagat—of the whole universe; käraëa—of the causes; käraëa-bhütaù—existing as the cause; sarva-pratyak-ätmatvät—because of being the Supersoul of every living being, or being present in everything, even the atom; sarva-guëa—of all the effects of the material modes of nature (such as intelligence and the senses); äbhäsa—by the manifestations; upalakñitaù—perceived; ekaù—alone; eva—indeed; paryavaçeñitaù—left remaining.
With deliberation, one will see that the Supreme Soul, although manifested in different ways, is actually the basic principle of everything. The total material energy is the cause of the material manifestation, but the material energy is caused by Him. Therefore He is the cause of all causes, the manifester of intelligence and the senses. He is perceived as the Supersoul of everything. Without Him, everything would be dead. You, as that Supersoul, the supreme controller, are the only one remaining.

Therefore, O killer of the Madhu demon, incessant transcendental bliss flows in the minds of those who have even once tasted but a drop of the nectar from the ocean of Your glories. Such exalted devotees forget the tiny reflection of so-called material happiness produced from the material senses of sight and sound. Free from all desires, such devotees are the real friends of all living entities. Offering their minds unto You and enjoying transcendental bliss, they are expert in achieving the real goal of life. O Lord, You are the soul and dear friend of such devotees, who never need return to this material world. How could they give up engagement in Your devotional service?

O Lord, O personified three worlds, father of the three worlds! O strength of the three worlds, in the form of the Vämana incarnation! O three-eyed form of Nåsiàhadeva! O most beautiful person within the three worlds! Everything and everyone, including human beings and even the Daitya demons and the Dänavas, is but an expansion of Your energy. O supremely powerful one, You have always appeared in Your forms as the various incarnations to punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful. You appear as Lord Vämanadeva, Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa. You appear sometimes as an animal like Lord Boar, sometimes a mixed incarnation like Lord Nåsiàhadeva and Lord Hayagréva, and sometimes an aquatic like Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise. Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the demons and Dänavas. We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another incarnation, if You so desire, to kill the great demon Våträsura.

O Lord, as the small sparks of a fire cannot possibly perform the actions of the whole fire, we sparks of Your Lordship cannot inform You of the necessities of our lives. You are the complete whole. Therefore, of what do we need to inform You? You know everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire universal creation. You always engage in Your pastimes with Your spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all these varied energies. You exist within all living entities, within the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them. You exist internally as Para-brahman and externally as the ingredients of the material creation. Therefore, although manifested in various stages, at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the Personality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes. Indeed, You are the original element. You are the witness of all activities, but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by any of them. You are the witness of everything as Para-brahman and Paramätmä. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, nothing is unknown to You.

Dear Lord, You are omniscient, and therefore You know very well why we have taken shelter at Your lotus feet, which provide shade that gives relief from all material disturbances. Since You are the supreme spiritual master and You know everything, we have sought shelter of Your lotus feet for instruction. Please give us relief by counteracting our present distress. Your lotus feet are the only shelter for a fully surrendered devotee and are the only means for subduing all the tribulations of this material world.

O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone's heart and observe all the desires and activities of the conditioned souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Kåñëa, Your reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no beginning, for You are the beginning of everything. This is understood by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and truthful. When the conditioned souls are liberated and sheltered at Your lotus feet after roving throughout the material world for many millions of years, they attain the highest success of life. Therefore, O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we offer our respectful obeisances at Your lotus feet.

[Närada gave Citraketu the following mantra.] O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, who are addressed by the oàkära [praëava], I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. O Lord Väsudeva, I meditate upon You. O Lord Pradyumna, Lord Aniruddha and Lord Saìkarñaëa, I offer You my respectful obeisances. O reservoir of spiritual potency, O supreme bliss, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are self-sufficient and most peaceful. O ultimate truth, one without a second, You are realized as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän and are therefore the reservoir of all knowledge. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Perceiving Your personal bliss, You are always transcendental to the waves of material nature. Therefore, my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the supreme controller of the senses, and Your expansions of form are unlimited. You are the greatest, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

vacasi—when the words; uparate—cease; apräpya—not achieving the goal; yaù—He who; ekaù—one without a second; manasä—the mind; saha—with; anäma—with no material name; rüpaù—or material form; cit-mätraù—totally spiritual; saù—He; avyät—may kindly protect; naù—us; sat-asat-paraù—who is the cause of all causes (the supreme cause).
The words and mind of the conditioned soul cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for material names and forms are not applicable to the Lord, who is entirely spiritual, beyond the conception of gross and subtle forms. The impersonal Brahman is another of His forms. May He, by His pleasure, protect us.

As pots made completely of earth are situated on earth after being created and are transformed into earth again when broken, this cosmic manifestation is caused by the Supreme Brahman, situated in the Supreme Brahman, and annihilated in the same Supreme Brahman. Therefore, since the Supreme Lord is the cause of Brahman, let us offer Him our respectful obeisances.

The Supreme Brahman emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and expands like the sky. Although untouched by anything material, it exists within and without. Nonetheless, the mind, intelligence, senses and living force can neither touch Him nor know Him. I offer unto Him my respectful obeisances.

As iron has the power to burn when made red-hot in the association of fire, so the body, senses, living force, mind and intelligence, although merely lumps of matter, can function in their activities when infused with a particle of consciousness by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As iron cannot burn unless heated by fire, the bodily senses cannot act unless favored by the Supreme Brahman.

O transcendental Lord, who are situated in the topmost planet of the spiritual world, Your two lotus feet are always massaged by a multitude of the best devotees with their lotus-bud hands. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, complete in six opulences. You are the supreme person mentioned in the Puruña-sükta prayers. You are the most perfect, self-realized master of all mystic power. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses. They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.

tava—Your; vibhavaù—opulences; khalu—indeed; bhagavan—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; jagat—of the cosmic manifestation; udaya—the creation; sthiti—maintenance; laya-ädéni—dissolution and so on; viçva-såjaù—the creators of the manifested world; te—they; aàça-aàçäù—parts of Your plenary portion; tatra—in that; måñä—in vain; spardhanti—rival one another; påthak—of separateness; abhimatyä—by a false conception.
My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your opulences. Since Lord Brahmä and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You, their partial power to create does not make them God [éçvara]. Their consciousness of themselves as separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige. It is not valid.

You exist in the beginning, middle and end of everything, from the most minute particle of the cosmic manifestation—the atom—to the gigantic universes and total material energy. Nonetheless, You are eternal, having no beginning, end or middle. You are perceived to exist in these three phases, and thus You are permanent. When the cosmic manifestation does not exist, You exist as the original potency.

Every universe is covered by seven layers—earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego—each ten times greater than the previous one. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited [ananta].

O Lord, O Supreme, unintelligent persons who thirst for sense enjoyment and who worship various demigods are no better than animals in the human form of life. Because of their animalistic propensities, they fail to worship Your Lordship, and instead they worship the insignificant demigods, who are but small sparks of Your glory. With the destruction of the entire universe, including the demigods, the benedictions received from the demigods also vanish, just like the nobility when a king is no longer in power.

käma-dhiyaù—desires for sense gratification; tvayi—in You; racitäù—performed; na—not; parama—O Supreme Personality of Godhead; rohanti—do grow (produce other bodies); yathä—just as; karambha-béjäni—sterilized or fried seeds; jïäna-ätmani—in You, whose existence is in full knowledge; aguëa-maye—who is not affected by the material qualities; guëa-gaëataù—from the material qualities; asya—of a person; dvandva-jäläni—the networks of duality.
O Supreme Lord, if persons obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material opulence worship You, who are the source of all knowledge and are transcendental to material qualities, they are not subject to material rebirth, just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants. Living entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature, but since You are transcendental, one who is inclined to associate with You in transcendence escapes the conditions of material nature.

O unconquerable one, when You spoke about bhägavata-dharma, which is the uncontaminated religious system for achieving the shelter of Your lotus feet, that was Your victory. Persons who have no material desires, like the Kumäras, who are self-satisfied sages, worship You to be liberated from material contamination. In other words, they accept the process of bhägavata-dharma to achieve shelter at Your lotus feet.

Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhägavata-dharma work under conceptions of fruitive results and distinctions of "you and I" and "yours and mine." The followers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam have no such consciousness. They are all Kåñëa conscious, thinking that they are Kåñëa's and Kåñëa is theirs. There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.

How can a religious system that produces envy of one's self and of others be beneficial for oneself and for them? What is auspicious about following such a system? What is actually to be gained? By causing pain to one's own self due to self-envy and by causing pain to others, one arouses Your anger and practices irreligion.

My dear Lord, one's occupational duty is instructed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam and the Bhagavad-gétä according to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life. Those who follow their occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and not considering high and low, are called Äryans. Such Äryans worship You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My Lord, it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing You. Not to speak of seeing You personally, merely by hearing the holy name of Your Lordship only once, even caëòälas, men of the lowest class, are freed from all material contamination. Under the circumstances, who will not be freed from material contamination simply by seeing You?

O unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead, whatever a living entity does in this material world is well known to You because You are the Supersoul. In the presence of the sun there is nothing to be revealed by the light of a glowworm. Similarly, because You know everything, in Your presence there is nothing for me to make known.

My dear Lord, You are the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this cosmic manifestation, but persons who are too materialistic and who always see separateness do not have eyes with which to see You. They cannot understand Your real position, and therefore they conclude that the cosmic manifestation is independent of Your opulence. My Lord, You are the supreme pure, and You are full in all six opulences. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My dear Lord, it is after You endeavor that Lord Brahmä, Indra and the other directors of the cosmic manifestation become occupied with their activities. It is after You perceive the material energy, My Lord, that the senses begin to perceive. The Supreme Personality of Godhead holds all the universes on His heads like seeds of mustard. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, that Supreme Personality, who has thousands of hoods.

I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Because the demoniac king Hiraëyakaçipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is insignificant. They do not even care for liberation, not to speak of the benefits of käma, artha and dharma.

Now, because this rogue has been killed by Your nails, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

Thus he directly blasphemed Your Lordship, the spiritual master of all living beings, and committed heavily sinful activities directed against me, Your devotee. I wish that he be excused for these sinful activities.

prasédatäm eña sa sätvatäà patiù
na—not; yasya—of whom; säkñät—directly; bhava—Lord Çiva; padma-ja—Lord Brahmä (born from the lotus); ädibhiù—by them and others also; rüpam—the form; dhiyä—even by meditation; vastutayä—fundamentally; upavarëitam—described and perceived; maunena—by samädhi, deep meditation; bhaktyä—by devotional service; upaçamena—by renunciation; püjitaù—worshiped; prasédatäm—may He be pleased; eñaù—this; saù—He; sätvatäm—of the great devotees; patiù—the master.
Exalted persons like Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä could not properly describe the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. May the Lord, who is always worshiped as the protector of all devotees by great saints who observe vows of silence, meditation, devotional service and renunciation, be pleased with us.

çré-prahräda uväca
mä mäà pralobhayotpattyä
saktaàkämeñu tair varaiù
tat-saìga-bhéto nirviëëo
mumukñus tväm upäçritaù

çré-prahrädaù uväca—Prahläda Mahäräja said (to the Supreme Personality of Godhead); mä—please do not; mäm—me; pralobhaya—allure; utpattyä—because of my birth (in a demoniac family); saktam—(I am already) attached; kämeñu—to material enjoyment; taiù—by all those; varaiù—benedictions of material possessions; tat-saìga-bhétaù—being afraid of such material association; nirviëëaù—completely detached from material desires; mumukñuù—desiring to be liberated from material conditions of life; tväm—unto Your lotus feet; upäçritaù—I have taken shelter.

Prahläda Mahäräja said: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because I was born in an atheistic family I am naturally attached to material enjoyment. Therefore, kindly do not tempt me with these illusions. I am very much afraid of material conditions, and I desire to be liberated from materialistic life. It is for this reason that I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.

bhåtya-lakñaëa-jijïäsur
bhaktaà kämeñv acodayat
bhavän saàsära-béjeñu
hådaya-granthiñu prabho

bhåtya-lakñaëa-jijïäsuù—desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee; bhaktam—the devotee; kämeñu—in the material world, where lusty desires predominate; acodayat—has sent; bhavän—Your Lordship; saàsära-béjeñu—the root cause of being present in this material world; hådaya-granthiñu—which (desire for material enjoyment) is in the cores of the hearts of all conditioned souls; prabho—O my worshipable Lord.

O my worshipable Lord, because the seed of lusty desires, which is the root cause of material existence, is within the core of everyone's heart, You have sent me to this material world to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee.
Text
nänyathä te 'khila-guro
ghaöeta karuëätmanaù
yas ta äçiña äçäste
na sa bhåtyaù sa vai vaëik

na—not; anyathä—otherwise; te—of You; akhila-guro—O supreme instructor of the entire creation; ghaöeta—such a thing can happen; karuëä-ätmanaù—the Supreme Person, who is extremely kind to His devotees; yaù—any person who; te—from You; äçiñaù—material benefits; äçäste—desires (in exchange for serving You); na—not; saù—such a person; bhåtyaù—a servitor; saù—such a person; vai—indeed; vaëik—a merchant (who wants to get material profit from his business).

Otherwise, O my Lord, O supreme instructor of the entire world, You are so kind to Your devotee that You could not induce him to do something unbeneficial for him. On the other hand, one who desires some material benefit in exchange for devotional service cannot be Your pure devotee. Indeed, he is no better than a merchant who wants profit in exchange for service.
Text
äçäsäno na vai bhåtyaù
sväminy äçiña ätmanaù
na svämé bhåtyataù svämyam
icchan yo räti cäçiñaù

äçäsänaù—a person who desires (in exchange for service); na—not; vai—indeed; bhåtyaù—a qualified servant or pure devotee of the Lord; svämini—from the master; äçiñaù—material benefit; ätmanaù—for personal sense gratification; na—nor; svämé—the master; bhåtyataù—from the servant; svämyam—the prestigious position of being the master; icchan—desiring; yaù—any such master who; räti—bestows; ca—also; äçiñaù—material profit.

A servant who desires material profits from his master is certainly not a qualified servant or pure devotee. Similarly, a master who bestows benedictions upon his servant because of a desire to maintain a prestigious position as master is also not a pure master.
Text
ahaà tv akämas tvad-bhaktas
tvaà ca svämy anapäçrayaù
nänyathehävayor artho

aham—as far as I am concerned; tu—indeed; akämaù—without material desire; tvat-bhaktaù—fully attached to You without motivation; tvam ca—Your Lordship also; svämé—the real master; anapäçrayaù—without motivation (You do not become the master with motivation); na—not; anyathä—without being in such a relationship as master and servant; iha—here; ävayoù—our; arthaù—any motivation (the Lord is the pure master, and Prahläda Mahäräja is the pure devotee with no materialistic motivation); räja—of a king; sevakayoù—and the servitor; iva—like (just as a king exacts taxes for the benefit of the servant or the citizens pay taxes for the benefit of the king).

O my Lord, I am Your unmotivated servant, and You are my eternal master. There is no need of our being anything other than master and servant. You are naturally my master, and I am naturally Your servant. We have no other relationship.

indriyäëi—the senses; manaù—the mind; präëaù—the life air; ätmä—the body; dharmaù—religion; dhåtiù—patience; matiù—intelligence; hréù—shyness; çréù—opulence; tejaù—strength; småtiù—memory; satyam—truthfulness; yasya—of which lusty desires; naçyanti—are vanquished; janmanä—from the very beginning of birth.

O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one's birth, the functions of one's senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience, intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are vanquished.
Text

O my Lord, when a human being is able to give up all the material desires in his mind, he becomes eligible to possess wealth and opulence like Yours.

O my Lord, full of six opulences, O Supreme Person! O Supreme Soul, killer of all miseries! O Supreme Person in the form of a wonderful lion and man, let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Song-1_Prayers by Svayambhuva Manu to the Supreme Lord (SB 8.1.9-16)

çré-manur uväca
yena cetayate viçvaà
viçvaà cetayate na yam
yo jägarti çayäne 'smin
näyaà taà veda veda saù
çré-manuù uväca—Sväyambhuva Manu chanted; yena—by whom (the Personality of Godhead); cetayate—is brought into animation; viçvam—the whole universe; viçvam—the whole universe (the material world); cetayate—animates; na—not; yam—He whom; yaù—He who; jägarti—is always awake (watching all activities); çayäne—while sleeping; asmin—in this body; na—not; ayam—this living entity; tam—Him; veda—knows; veda—knows; saù—He.
Lord Manu said: The supreme living being has created this material world of animation; it is not that He was created by this material world. When everything is silent, the Supreme Being stays awake as a witness. The living entity does not know Him, but He knows everything.
Text 10
ätmäväsyam idaà viçvaà
yat kiïcij jagatyäà jagat
tena tyaktena bhuïjéthä
mä gådhaù kasya svid dhanam
ätma—the Supersoul; äväsyam—living everywhere; idam—this universe; viçvam—all universes, all places; yat—whatever; kiïcit—everything that exists; jagatyäm—in this world, everywhere; jagat—everything, animate and inanimate; tena—by Him; tyaktena—allotted; bhuïjéthäù—you may enjoy; mä—do not; gådhaù—accept; kasya svit—of anyone else; dhanam—the property.
Within this universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature is present everywhere, wherever there are animate or inanimate beings. Therefore, one should accept only that which is allotted to him; one should not desire to infringe upon the property of others.
Text 11
yaà paçyati na paçyantaà
cakñur yasya na riñyati

yam—He who; paçyati—the living entity sees; na—not; paçyantam—although always seeing; cakñuù—eye; yasya—whose; na—never; riñyati—diminishes; tam—Him; bhüta-nilayam—the original source of all living entities; devam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; suparëam—who accompanies the living entity as a friend; upadhävata—everyone should worship.
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly watches the activities of the world, no one sees Him. However, one should not think that because no one sees Him, He does not see, for His power to see is never diminished. Therefore, everyone should worship the Supersoul, who always stays with the individual soul as a friend.
Text 12
na yasyädy-antau madhyaà ca
svaù paro näntaraà bahiù
viçvasyämüni yad yasmäd
viçvaà ca tad åtaà mahat
na—neither; yasya—of whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); ädi—a beginning; antau—end; madhyam—middle; ca—also; svaù—own; paraù—others; na—nor; antaram—inside; bahiù—outside; viçvasya—of the whole cosmic manifestation; amüni—all such considerations; yat—whose form; yasmät—from Him who is the cause of everything; viçvam—the whole universe; ca—and; tat—all of them; åtam—truth; mahat—very, very great.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning, no end and no middle. Nor does He belong to a particular person or nation. He has no inside or outside. The dualities found within this material world, such as beginning and end, mine and theirs, are all absent from the personality of the Supreme Lord. The universe, which emanates from Him, is another feature of the Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate truth, and He is complete in greatness.
Text 13

satyaù svayaà-jyotir ajaù puräëaù
dhatte 'sya janmädy-ajayätma-çaktyä
täà vidyayodasya niréha äste
saù—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; viçva-käyaù—the total form of the universe (the whole universe is the external body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead); puru-hütaù—known by so many names; éçaù—the supreme controller (with full power); satyaù—the ultimate truth; svayam—personally; jyotiù—self-effulgent; ajaù—unborn, beginningless; puräëaù—the oldest; dhatte—He performs; asya—of this universe; janma-ädi—the creation, maintenance and annihilation; ajayä—by His external energy; ätma-çaktyä—by His personal potency; täm—that external material energy; vidyayä—by His spiritual potency; udasya—giving up; niréhaù—without any desire or activity; äste—He is existing (untouched by the material energy).
The entire cosmic manifestation is the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, who has millions of names and unlimited potencies. He is self-effulgent, unborn and changeless. He is the beginning of everything, but He has no beginning. Because He has created this cosmic manifestation by His external energy, the universe appears to be created, maintained and annihilated by Him. Nonetheless, He remains materially inactive—situated in His spiritual energy and untouched by the activities of the material energy.
Text 14
athägre åñayaù karmäë-

atha—therefore; agre—in the beginning; åñayaù—all learned åñis, saintly persons; karmäëi—fruitive activities; éhante—execute; akarma—freedom from fruitive results; hetave—for the purpose of; éhamänaù—engaging in such activities; hi—indeed; puruñaù—a person; präyaù—almost always; anéhäm—liberation from karma; prapadyate—attains.
Therefore, to enable people to reach the stage of activities that are not tinged by fruitive results, great saints first engage people in fruitive activities, for unless one begins by performing activities as recommended in the çästras, one cannot reach the stage of liberation, or activities that produce no reactions.
Text 15
éhate bhagavän éço

éhate—engages in activities of creation, maintenance and annihilation; bhagavän—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa; éçaù—the supreme controller; na—not; hi—indeed; tatra—in such activities; visajjate—He becomes entangled; ätma-läbhena—because of His own gain; pürëa-arthaù—who is self-satisfied; na—not; avasédanti—are disheartened; ye—persons who; anu—follow; tam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in opulence by His own gain, yet He acts as the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world. In spite of acting in that way, He is never entangled. Hence devotees who follow in His footsteps are also never entangled.
Text 16

tam—unto the same Supreme Personality of Godhead; éhamänam—who is acting for our benefit; nirahaìkåtam—who is without entanglement or desire for gain; budham—who is completely in knowledge; niräçiñam—without desires to enjoy the fruits of His activities; pürëam—who is full and therefore has no need to fulfill desires; ananya—by others; coditam—induced or inspired; nèn—all of human society; çikñayantam—to teach (the real path of life); nija-vartma—His own personal way of life; saàsthitam—to establish (without deviation); prabhum—unto the Supreme Lord; prapadye—I request everyone to surrender; akhila-dharma-bhävanam—who is the master of all religious principles or the occupational duties for a human being.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, works just like an ordinary human being, yet He does not desire to enjoy the fruits of work. He is full in knowledge, free from material desires and diversions, and completely independent. As the supreme teacher of human society, He teaches His own way of activities, and thus He inaugurates the real path of religion. I request everyone to follow Him.

The king of the elephants, Gajendra, said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, Väsudeva [oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya]. Because of Him this material body acts due to the presence of spirit, and He is therefore the root cause of everyone. He is worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahmä and Çiva, and He has entered the heart of every living being. Let me meditate upon Him.

The Supreme Godhead is the supreme platform on which everything rests, the ingredient by which everything has been produced, and the person who has created and is the only cause of this cosmic manifestation. Nonetheless, He is different from the cause and the result. I surrender unto Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is self-sufficient in everything.
Text 4

kvacid vibhätaà kva ca tat tirohitam

yaù—the Supreme Personality of Godhead who; sva-ätmani—in Him; idam—this cosmic manifestation; nija-mäyayä—by His own potency; arpitam—invested; kvacit—sometimes, at the beginning of a kalpa; vibhätam—it is manifested; kva ca—sometimes, during dissolution; tat—that (manifestation); tirohitam—not visible; aviddha-dåk—He sees everything (in all these circumstances); säkñé—the witness; ubhayam—both (manifestation and annihilation); tat ékñate—sees everything, without loss of sight; saù—that Supreme Personality of Godhead; ätma-mülaù—self-sufficient, having no other cause; avatu—please give protection; mäm—unto me; parät-paraù—He is transcendental to transcendental, or above all transcendence.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by expanding His own energy, keeps this cosmic manifestation visible and again sometimes renders it invisible. He is both the supreme cause and the supreme result, the observer and the witness, in all circumstances. Thus He is transcendental to everything. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead give me protection.

In due course of time, when all the causative and effective manifestations of the universe, including the planets and their directors and maintainers, are annihilated, there is a situation of dense darkness. Above this darkness, however, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I take shelter of His lotus feet.

An artist onstage, being covered by attractive dresses and dancing with different movements, is not understood by his audience; similarly, the activities and features of the supreme artist cannot be understood even by the demigods or great sages, and certainly not by those who are unintelligent like animals. Neither the demigods and sages nor the unintelligent can understand the features of the Lord, nor can they express in words His actual position. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead give me protection.

Renunciants and great sages who see all living beings equally, who are friendly to everyone and who flawlessly practice in the forest the vows of brahmacarya, vänaprastha and sannyäsa desire to see the all-auspicious lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. May that same Supreme Personality of Godhead be my destination.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material birth, activities, name, form, qualities or faults. To fulfill the purpose for which this material world is created and destroyed, He comes in the form of a human being like Lord Räma or Lord Kåñëa by His original internal potency. He has immense potency, and in various forms, all free from material contamination, He acts wonderfully. He is therefore the Supreme Brahman. I offer my respects to Him.

I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Väsudeva, who is all-pervading, to the Lord's fierce form as Lord Nåsiàhadeva, to the Lord's form as an animal [Lord Varähadeva], to Lord Dattätreya, who preached impersonalism, to Lord Buddha, and to all the other incarnations. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has no material qualities but who accepts the three qualities goodness, passion and ignorance within this material world. I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman effulgence.

You are the Supreme Person, the origin of material nature and of the total material energy. You are also the owner of the material body. Therefore, You are the supreme complete. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, You are the observer of all the objectives of the senses. Without Your mercy, there is no possibility of solving the problem of doubts. The material world is just like a shadow resembling You. Indeed, one accepts this material world as real because it gives a glimpse of Your existence.

My Lord, You are the cause of all causes, but You Yourself have no cause. Therefore You are the wonderful cause of everything. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic knowledge contained in the çästras like the Païcarätras and Vedänta-sütra, which are Your representations, and who are the source of the paramparä system. Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

My Lord, as the fire in araëi wood is covered, You and Your unlimited knowledge are covered by the material modes of nature. Your mind, however, is not attentive to the activities of the modes of nature. Those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge are not subject to the regulative principles directed in the Vedic literatures. Because such advanced souls are transcendental, You personally appear in their pure minds. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

Indeed, being extremely merciful, You incessantly try to deliver me. By your partial feature as Paramätmä, You are situated in the hearts of all embodied beings. You are celebrated as direct transcendental knowledge, and You are unlimited. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My Lord, those who are completely freed from material contamination always meditate upon You within the cores of their hearts.

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, uncontaminated by the modes of nature. You are the reservoir of all enlightenment, the supreme controller.

After worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, those who are interested in the four principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation obtain from Him what they desire. What then is to be said of other benedictions? Indeed, sometimes the Lord gives a spiritual body to such ambitious worshipers. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unlimitedly merciful, bestow upon me the benediction of liberation from this present danger and from the materialistic way of life.

Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious. Thus they always merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. Such devotees never ask the Lord for any benediction. I, however, am in danger. Thus I pray to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally existing, who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahmä, and who is available only by transcendental bhakti-yoga. Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and transcendental to all external realization. He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely full in everything. I offer my obeisances unto Him.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates His minor parts and parcels, the jéva-tattva, beginning with Lord Brahmä, the demigods and the expansions of Vedic knowledge [Säma, Åg, Yajur and Atharva] and including all other living entities, moving and nonmoving, with their different names and characteristics. As the sparks of a fire or the shining rays of the sun emanate from their source and merge into it again and again, the mind, the intelligence, the senses, the gross and subtle material bodies, and the continuous transformations of the different modes of nature all emanate from the Lord and again merge into Him. He is neither demigod nor demon, neither human nor bird or beast. He is not woman, man, or neuter, nor is He an animal. He is not a material quality, a fruitive activity, a manifestation or nonmanifestation. He is the last word in the discrimination of "not this, not this," and He is unlimited. All glories to the Supreme Personality of Godhead!

You are the supreme master of everyone, and therefore You are worshipable for everyone. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead directly and indirectly knows how everything, including the living force, mind and intelligence, is working under His control. He is the illuminator of everything and has no ignorance. He does not have a material body subject to the reactions of previous activities, and He is free from the ignorance of partiality and materialistic education. I therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, who is eternal, all-pervading and as great as the sky and who appears with six opulences in three yugas [Satya, Tretä and Dväpara].

In the cycle of material activities, the material body resembles the wheel of a mental chariot. The ten senses [five for working and five for gathering knowledge] and the five life airs within the body form the fifteen spokes of the chariot's wheel. The three modes of nature [goodness, passion and ignorance] are its center of activities, and the eight ingredients of nature [earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego] comprise the rim of the wheel. The external, material energy moves this wheel like electrical energy. Thus the wheel revolves very quickly around its hub or central support, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul and the ultimate truth. We offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in pure goodness [çuddha-sattva], and therefore He is eka-varëa—the oàkära [praëava]. Because the Lord is beyond the cosmic manifestation, which is considered to be darkness, He is not visible to material eyes. Nonetheless, He is not separated from us by time or space, but is present everywhere. Seated on His carrier, Garuòa, He is worshiped by means of mystical yogic power by those who have achieved freedom from agitation. Let us all offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

That same mäyä, however, is subdued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who rules everyone and who is equally disposed toward all living entities. Let us offer our obeisances unto Him.

Since our bodies are made of sattva-guëa, we, the demigods, are internally and externally situated in goodness. All the great saints are also situated in that way.

How can they understand the Lord? Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

O lord, your shadow is seen in irreligion, which brings about varieties of irreligious creations. The three modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—are your three eyes. All the Vedic literatures, which are full of verses, are emanations from you because their compilers wrote the various scriptures after receiving your glance.

Exalted, self-satisfied persons who preach to the entire world think of your lotus feet constantly within their hearts. However, when persons who do not know your austerity see you moving with Umä, they misunderstand you to be lusty, or when they see you wandering in the crematorium they mistakenly think that you are ferocious and envious. Certainly they are shameless. They cannot understand your activities.

Even personalities like Lord Brahmä and other demigods cannot understand your position, for you are beyond the moving and nonmoving creation. Since no one can understand you in truth, how can one offer you prayers? It is impossible. As far as we are concerned, we are creatures of Lord Brahmä's creation. Under the circumstances, therefore, we cannot offer you adequate prayers, but as far as our ability allows, we have expressed our feelings.

Therefore, You are Parameçvara, the supreme controller of all controllers.

My Lord, You are the Supreme Brahman, complete in everything. Being completely spiritual, You are eternal, free from the material modes of nature, and full of transcendental bliss. Indeed, for You there is no question of lamentation. Since You are the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, nothing can exist without You. Yet we are different from You in a relationship of cause and effect, for in one sense the cause and effect are different. You are the original cause of creation, manifestation and annihilation, and You bestow benedictions upon all living entities. Everyone depends upon You for the results of his activities, but You are always independent.

My dear Lord, Your Lordship alone is the cause and the effect. Therefore, although You appear to be two, You are the absolute one. As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same. Only because of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities. You are free from material contamination, and since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your transcendental qualities. Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be maintained.

The Säìkhya philosophers regard You as the transcendental person who is beyond prakåti and puruña and who is the controller of even the demigods. The followers of the codes of devotional service known as the Païcarätras regard You as being endowed with nine different potencies. And the Pataïjala philosophers, the followers of Pataïjali Muni, regard You as the supreme independent Personality of Godhead, who has no equal or superior.

As the air enters the vast sky and also enters the bodies of all moving and nonmoving entities, You are present everywhere, and therefore You are the knower of all.

To You, the supreme creator, who are understood only through Vedic knowledge, I offer my respectful obeisances.

What is the use of the material body, which automatically leaves its owner at the end of life? And what is the use of all one's family members, who are actually plunderers taking away money that is useful for the service of the Lord in spiritual opulence? What is the use of a wife? She is only the source of increasing material conditions. And what is the use of family, home, country and community? Attachment for them merely wastes the valuable energy of one's lifetime.

This is not partiality, however, for Your characteristic is just like that of a desire tree, which yields everything according to one's desire.

Neither all the demigods, nor the so-called gurus nor all other people, either independently or together, can offer mercy that equals even one ten-thousandth of Yours. Therefore I wish to take shelter of Your lotus feet.

So what to speak of others like us, who have been created by Brahmä in various forms as demigods, animals, human beings, birds and beasts? We are completely in ignorance. Therefore, how can we know You, who are the Transcendence?

My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone's heart, but the living entities, covered by the material body, cannot see You, for they are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three modes of material nature. Their intelligence being covered by sattva-guëa, rajo-guëa and tamo-guëa, they can see only the actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature. Because of the actions and reactions of the mode of ignorance, whether the living entities are awake or sleeping, they can see only the workings of material nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.

O completely peaceful Lord, although material nature, fruitive activities and their consequent material names and forms are Your creation, You are unaffected by them. Therefore, Your transcendental name is different from material names, and Your form is different from material forms. You assume a form resembling a material body just to give us instructions like those of Bhagavad-gétä, but actually You are the supreme original person. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

satya-vrataṁ satya-paraṁ tri-satyaṁ
satyasya yoniṁ nihitaṁ ca satye
satyasya satyam ṛta-satya-netraṁ
satyātmakaṁ tvāṁ śaraṇaṁ prapannāḥ
satya-vratam—the Personality of Godhead, who never deviates from His vow *; satya-param—who is the Absolute Truth (as stated in the beginning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi); tri-satyam—He is always present as the Absolute Truth, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, during its maintenance, and even after its annihilation; satyasya—of all relative truths, which are emanations from the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa; yonim—the cause; nihitam—entered *; ca—and; satye—in the factors that create this material world (namely, the five elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether); satyasya—of all that is accepted as the truth; satyam—the Lord is the original truth; ṛta-satya-netram—He is the origin of whatever truth is pleasing (sunetram); satya-ātmakam—everything pertaining to the Lord is truth (sac-cid-ānanda: His body is truth, His knowledge is truth, and His pleasure is truth); tvām—unto you, O Lord; śaraṇam—offering our full surrender; prapannāḥ—we are completely under Your protection.
The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic manifestation—creation, maintenance and annihilation—You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antaryāmī, the inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.

catū-rasaḥ pañca-vidhaḥ ṣaḍ-ātmā
sapta-tvag aṣṭa-viṭapo navākṣo
daśa-cchadī dvi-khago hy ādi-vṛkṣaḥ
eka-ayanaḥ—the body of an ordinary living being is fully dependent on the material elements; asau—that; dvi-phalaḥ—in this body we are subject to material happiness and distress, which result from karma; tri-mūlaḥ—having three roots, the three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), upon which the body is created;  catuḥ-rasaḥ—four rasas, or tastes; pañca-vidhaḥ—consisting of five senses for acquiring knowledge (the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch); ṣaṭ-ātmā—six circumstances (lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst); sapta-tvak—having seven coverings (skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen); aṣṭa-viṭapaḥ—eight branches (the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and also the mind, intelligence and ego); nava-akṣaḥ—nine holes; daśa-chadī—ten kinds of life air, resembling the leaves of a tree; dvi-khagaḥ—two birds (the individual soul and the Supersoul); hi—indeed; ādi-vṛkṣaḥ -this is the original tree or construction of the material body, whether individual or universal.
The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called "the original tree." From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit—the enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association with the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four tastes—religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation—which are experienced through five senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements—earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows—the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the rectum and the genitals—and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.

tvam—You (O Lord); ekaḥ—being one without a second, You are everything; eva—indeed; asya sataḥ—of this cosmic manifestation now visible; prasūtiḥ—the original source; tvam—Your Lordship; sannidhānam—the conservation of all such energy when everything is annihilated; tvam—Your Lordship; anugrahaḥ ca—and the maintainer; tvat-māyayā—by Your illusory, external energy; saṁvṛta-cetasaḥ—those whose intelligence is covered by such illusory energy; tvām—unto You; paśyanti—observe; nānā—many varieties; na—not; vipaścitaḥ—learned scholars or devotees; ye—who are.
The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord. You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is not the vision of learned devotees.

O Lord, You are always in full knowledge, and to bring all good fortune to all living entities, You appear in different incarnations, all of them transcendental to the material creation. When You appear in these incarnations, You are pleasing to the pious and religious devotees, but for nondevotees You are the annihilator.

tvayi—in You; ambuja-akṣa—O lotus-eyed Lord; akhila-sattva-dhāmni—who are the original cause of all existence, from whom everything emanates and in whom all potencies reside; samādhinā—by constant meditation and complete absorption (in thoughts of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead); āveśita—fully absorbed, fully engaged; cetasā—but by such a mentality; eke—the one process of always thinking of Your lotus feet; tvat-pāda-potena—by boarding such a boat as Your lotus feet; mahat-kṛtena—by that action which is considered the most powerful original existence or which is executed by mahājanas; kurvanti—they make; govatsa-padam—like the hoofprint of a calf; bhava-abdhim—the great ocean of nescience.
O lotus-eyed Lord, by concentrating one's meditation on Your lotus feet, which are the reservoir of all existence, and by accepting those lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of mahājanas [great saints, sages and devotees]. By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.

svayam—personally; samuttīrya—perfectly crossing; su-dustaram—which is very difficult to cross; dyuman—O Lord, who appear exactly like the sun, illuminating the darkness of this world of ignorance; bhava-arṇavam—the ocean of nescience; bhīmam—which is extremely fierce; adabhra-sauhṛdāḥ—devotees who are incessantly friendly to the fallen souls; bhavat-pada-ambhoruha—Your lotus feet; nāvam—the boat for crossing; atra—in this world; te—they (the Vaiṣṇavas); nidhāya—leaving behind; yātāḥ—on to the ultimate destination, Vaikuṇṭha; sat-anugrahaḥ—who are always kind and merciful to the devotees; bhavān—You.
O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore You are known as a desire tree [vāñchā-kalpataru]. When ācāryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.

[Someone may say that aside from devotees, who always seek shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, there are those who are not devotees but who have accepted different processes for attaining salvation. What happens to them? In answer to this question, Lord Brahmā and the other demigods said:] O lotus-eyed Lord, although nondevotees who accept severe austerities and penances to achieve the highest position may think themselves liberated, their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because they have no regard for Your lotus feet.

O Mādhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.

O Lord, during the time of maintenance You manifest several incarnations, all with transcendental bodies, beyond the material modes of nature. When You appear in this way, You bestow all good fortune upon the living entities by teaching them to perform Vedic activities such as ritualistic ceremonies, mystic yoga, austerities, penances, and ultimately samādhi, ecstatic absorption in thoughts of You. Thus You are worshiped by the Vedic principles.

O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.

Similarly, the living entities, who are part of You, have no cause for miseries like birth, death and old age, except when these living entities are conducted by Your external energy.

Now please protect us again by Your mercy by diminishing the disturbances in this world. O Kṛṣṇa, best of the Yadus, we respectfully offer our obeisances unto You.

Vasudeva said: My Lord, You are the Supreme Person, beyond material existence, and You are the Supersoul. Your form can be perceived by transcendental knowledge, by which You can be understood as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I now understand Your position perfectly.

My Lord, You are the same person who in the beginning created this material world by His personal external energy. After the creation of this world of three guṇas [sattva, rajas and tamas], You appear to have entered it, although in fact You have not.

yathā—as; ime—these material creations, made of material energy; avikṛtāḥ—actually not unintegrated; bhāvāḥ—with such a conception; tathā—similarly; te—they; vikṛtaiḥ saha—association with these different elements coming from the total material energy; nānā-vīryāḥ—every element is full of different energies; pṛthak—separated; bhūtāḥ—becoming; virājam—the whole cosmic manifestation; janayanti—create; hi—indeed; sannipatya—because of association with the spiritual energy; samutpādya—after being created; dṛśyante—they appear; anugatāḥ—entered within it; iva—as if; prāk—from the very beginning, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation; eva—indeed; vidyamānatvāt—due to the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; na—not; teṣām—of these material elements; iha—in this matter of creation; sambhavaḥ—entering would have been possible; evam—in this way; bhavān—O my Lord; buddhi-anumeya-lakṣaṇaiḥ—by real intelligence and by such symptoms; grāhyaiḥ—with the objects of the senses; guṇaiḥ—with the modes of material nature; san api—although in touch; tat-guṇa-agrahaḥ—are not touched by the material qualities; anāvṛtatvāt—because of being situated everywhere; bahiḥ antaram—within the external and internal; na te—there is no such thing for You; sarvasya—of everything; sarva-ātmanaḥ—You are the root of everything; ātma-vastunaḥ—everything belongs to You, but You are outside and inside of everything.
The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [jīva-bhūta], these separated energies combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the mind or words [avāṅ-mānasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses. Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never entered the womb of Devakī; rather, You existed there already.

yaḥ—anyone who; ātmanaḥ—of his own real identity, the soul; dṛśya-guṇeṣu—among the visible objects, beginning with the body; san—being situated in that position; iti—thus; vyavasyate—continues to act; sva-vyatirekataḥ—as if the body were independent of the soul; abudhaḥ—a rascal; vinā anuvādam—without proper analytical study; na—not; ca—also; tat—the body and other visible objects; manīṣitam—such considerations having been discussed; samyak—fully; yataḥ—because he is a fool; tyaktam—are rejected; upādadat—accepts this body as reality; pumān—a person.
One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in the soul, the visible body and senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it a reality.

O my Lord, learned Vedic scholars conclude that the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the entire cosmic manifestation are performed by You, who are free from endeavor, unaffected by the modes of material nature, and changeless in Your spiritual situation. There are no contradictions in You, who are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Para-brahman. Because the three modes of material nature-sattva, rajas and tamas—are under Your control, everything takes place automatically.

My Lord, Your form is transcendental to the three material modes, yet for the maintenance of the three worlds, You assume the white color of Viṣṇu in goodness; for creation, which is surrounded by the quality of passion, You appear reddish; and at the end, when there is a need for annihilation, which is surrounded by ignorance, You appear blackish.

They must be killed by You for the protection of the innocent public.

śrī-devakī uvāca—Śrī Devakī said; rūpam—form or substance; yat tat—because You are the same substance; prāhuḥ—You are sometimes called; avyaktam—not perceivable by the material senses (ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ); ādyam—You are the original cause; brahma—You are known as Brahman; jyotiḥ—light; nirguṇam—without material qualities; nirvikāram—without change, the same form of Viṣṇu perpetually; sattā-mātram—the original substance, the cause of everything; nirviśeṣam—You are present everywhere as the Supersoul (within the heart of a human being and within the heart of an animal, the same substance is present); nirīham—without material desires; saḥ—that Supreme Person; tvam—Your Lordship; sākṣāt—directly; viṣṇuḥ—Lord Viṣṇu; adhyātma-dīpaḥ—the light for all transcendental knowledge (knowing You, one knows everything: kasmin nu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavatīti).
Śrī Devakī said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Paramātmā, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Viṣṇu, the light of all transcendental knowledge.

After millions of years, at the time of cosmic annihilation, when everything, manifested and unmanifested, is annihilated by the force of time, the five gross elements enter into the subtle conception, and the manifested categories enter into the unmanifested substance. At that time, You alone remain, and You are known as Ananta Śeṣa-nāga.

Let me offer my full surrender unto Your Lordship.

But now this transcendental form has taken birth from my womb. People will not be able to believe this, and I shall become an object of ridicule.

You are the Supersoul, and therefore You know everything within the core of the heart of every living entity.

O son of the king of the cowherds, Your transcendental body is dark blue like a new cloud, Your garment is brilliant like lightning, and the beauty of Your face is enhanced by Your guñjā earrings and the peacock feather on Your head. Wearing garlands of various forest flowers and leaves, and equipped with a herding stick, a buffalo horn and a flute, You stand beautifully with a morsel of food in Your hand.

Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.

My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the best path for self-realization.

As a person who beats an empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble.

Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal feature. Nevertheless, it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.

In time, learned philosophers or scientists might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the particles of snow, or perhaps even the shining molecules radiating from the sun, the stars and other luminaries. But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?

Therefore, O infallible Lord, kindly excuse my offenses. I have taken birth in the mode of passion and am therefore simply foolish, presuming myself a controller independent of Your Lordship. My eyes are blinded by the darkness of ignorance, which causes me to think of myself as the unborn creator of the universe. But please consider that I am Your servant and therefore worthy of Your compassion.

O Lord Adhokṣaja, does a mother take offense when the child within her womb kicks with his legs? And is there anything in existence—whether designated by various philosophers as real or as unreal—that is actually outside Your abdomen?

My dear Lord, it is said that when the three planetary systems are merged into the water at the time of dissolution, Your plenary portion, Nārāyaṇa, lies down on the water, gradually a lotus flower grows from His navel, and Brahmā takes birth upon that lotus flower. Certainly, these words are not false. Thus am I not born from You?

Are You not the original Nārāyaṇa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Nārāyaṇa is Your expansion, and He is called Nārāyaṇa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Māyā.

My dear Lord, if Your transcendental body, which shelters the entire universe, is actually lying upon the water, then why were You not seen by me when I searched for You? And why, though I could not envision You properly within my heart, did You then suddenly reveal Yourself?

My dear Lord, in this incarnation You have proved that You are the supreme controller of Māyā. Although You are now within this universe, the whole universal creation is within Your transcendental body—a fact You demonstrated by exhibiting the universe within Your abdomen before Your mother, Yaśodā.

Have You not shown me today that both You Yourself and everything within this creation are manifestations of Your inconceivable potency? First You appeared alone, and then You manifested Yourself as all of Vṛndāvana's calves and cowherd boys, Your friends. Next You appeared as an equal number of four-handed Viṣṇu forms, who were worshiped by all living beings, including me, and after that You appeared as an equal number of complete universes. Finally, You have now returned to Your unlimited form as the Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second.

No one can understand the mystery of how Your spiritual energy acts.

Therefore this entire universe, which like a dream is by nature unreal, nevertheless appears real, and thus it covers one's consciousness and assails one with repeated miseries. This universe appears real because it is manifested by the potency of illusion emanating from You, whose unlimited transcendental forms are full of eternal happiness and knowledge.

A person who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful, but he then gives up his fear upon realizing that the so-called snake does not exist. Similarly, for those who fail to recognize You as the Supreme Soul of all souls, the expansive illusory material existence arises, but knowledge of You at once causes it to subside.

The conception of material bondage and the conception of liberation are both manifestations of ignorance. Being outside the scope of true knowledge, they cease to exist when one correctly understands that the pure spirit soul is distinct from matter and always fully conscious. At that time bondage and liberation no longer have any significance, just as day and night have no significance from the perspective of the sun.

O almighty Lord, how greatly fortunate are the cows and ladies of Vṛndāvana, the nectar of whose breast-milk You have happily drunk to Your full satisfaction, taking the form of their calves and children!

Yet even though the extent of the good fortune of these residents of Vṛndāvana is inconceivable, we eleven presiding deities of the various senses, headed by Lord Śiva, are also most fortunate, because the senses of these devotees of Vṛndāvana are the cups through which we repeatedly drink the nectarean, intoxicating beverage of the honey of Your lotus feet.

My mind becomes bewildered just trying to think of what reward other than You could be found anywhere. You are the embodiment of all benedictions, which You bestow upon these residents of the cowherd community of Vṛndāvana. You have already arranged to give Yourself to Pūtanā and her family members in exchange for her disguising herself as a devotee. So what is left for You to give these devotees of Vṛndāvana, whose homes, wealth, friends, dear relations, bodies, children and very lives and hearts are all dedicated only to You?

The wives of the Kāliya serpent said: The punishment this offender has been subjected to is certainly just. After all, You have incarnated within this world to curb down envious and cruel persons. You are so impartial that You look equally upon Your enemies and Your own sons, for when You impose a punishment on a living being You know it to be for his ultimate benefit.

What You have done here is actually mercy for us, since the punishment You give to the wicked certainly drives away all their contamination. Indeed, because this conditioned soul, our husband, is so sinful that he has assumed the body of a serpent, Your anger toward him is obviously to be understood as Your mercy.

O Lord, although this Kāliya, the king of the serpents, has taken birth in the mode of ignorance and is controlled by anger, he has achieved that which is difficult for others to achieve. Embodied souls, who are full of desires and are thus wandering in the cycle of birth and death, can have all benedictions manifested before their eyes simply by receiving the dust of Your lotus feet.

We offer our obeisances unto You, the unlimited Supreme Lord, the supremely subtle one, the omniscient Personality of Godhead, who are always fixed in unchanging transcendence, who sanction the opposing views of different philosophies, and who are the power upholding expressed ideas and the words that express them.

As these two sons enter the forest, surrounded by Their friends, driving the cows before Them, They hold Their flutes to Their mouths and glance lovingly upon the residents of Vṛndāvana. For those who have eyes, we think there is no greater object of vision.

The forefathers of the flute, the bamboo trees, shed tears of pleasure. His mother, the river on whose bank the bamboo was born, feels jubilation, and therefore her blooming lotus flowers are standing like hair on her body.

When You go off to the forest during the day, a tiny fraction of a second becomes like a millennium for us because we cannot see You. And even when we can eagerly look upon Your beautiful face, so lovely with its adornment of curly locks, our pleasure is hindered by our eyelids, which were fashioned by the foolish creator.

Dear Acyuta, You know very well why we have come here. Who but a cheater like You would abandon young women who come to see Him in the middle of the night, enchanted by the loud song of His flute? Just to see You, we have completely rejected our husbands, children, ancestors, brothers and other relatives.

Thus we experience the most severe hankering for You.

O dearly beloved! Your lotus feet are so soft that we place them gently on our breasts, fearing that Your feet will be hurt. Our life rests only in You. Our minds, therefore, are filled with anxiety that Your tender feet might be wounded by pebbles as You roam about on the forest path.

The gopīs said: O gopīs, when Mukunda vibrates the flute He has placed to His lips, stopping its holes with His tender fingers, He rests His left cheek on His left arm and makes His eyebrows dance. At that time the demigoddesses traveling in the sky with their husbands, the Siddhas, become amazed. As those ladies listen, they are embarrassed to find their minds yielding to the pursuit of lusty desires, and in their distress they are unaware that the belts of their garments are loosening.

O girls! This son of Nanda, who gives joy to the distressed, bears steady lightning on His chest and has a smile like a jeweled necklace. Now please hear something wonderful. When He vibrates His flute, Vraja's bulls, deer and cows, standing in groups at a great distance, are all captivated by the sound, and they stop chewing the food in their mouths and cock their ears. Stunned, they appear as if asleep, or like figures in a painting.

My dear gopī, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balarāma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.

Kṛṣṇa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kṛṣṇa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viṣṇu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.

O goddesses of Vraja, when Kṛṣṇa is enjoying Himself with Balarāma on the mountain slopes, playfully wearing a flower garland on the top of His head, He engladdens all with the resonant vibrations of His flute. Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend Kṛṣṇa and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.

O pious Mother Yaśodā, your son, who is expert in all the arts of herding cows, has invented many new styles of flute-playing. When He takes His flute to His bimba-red lips and sends forth the tones of the harmonic scale in variegated melodies, Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and other chief demigods become confused upon hearing the sound. Although they are the most learned authorities, they cannot ascertain the essence of that music, and thus they bow down their heads and hearts.

As Kṛṣṇa strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gopīs, who become agitated by Cupid when Kṛṣṇa playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.

Now Kṛṣṇa is standing somewhere counting His cows on a string of gems. He wears a garland of tulasī flowers that bear the fragrance of His beloved, and He has thrown His arm over the shoulder of an affectionate cowherd boyfriend. As Kṛṣṇa plays His flute and sings, the music attracts the black deer's wives, who approach that ocean of transcendental qualities and sit down beside Him. Just like us cowherd girls, they have given up all hope for happiness in family life.

Out of great affection for the cows of Vraja, Kṛṣṇa became the lifter of Govardhana Hill. At the end of the day, having rounded up all His own cows, He plays a song on His flute, while exalted demigods standing along the path worship His lotus feet and the cowherd boys accompanying Him chant His glories. His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Kṛṣṇa is the moon arisen from the womb of Mother Yaśodā.

With His cheerful face resembling the moon, lord of the night, the Lord of the Yadus moves with the grace of a regal elephant. Thus He returns in the evening, delivering the cows of Vraja from the heat of the day.

You are the witness within everyone, the Supreme Personality and the ultimate controlling Deity.

You will bring back a brāhmaṇa's dead son from the abode of Your servant Yamarāja, and thereafter You will kill Pauṇḍraka, burn down the city of Kāśī and slay Dantavakra, and You will also put an end to the king of Cedi during the great Rājasūya sacrifice. I shall see all these heroic pastimes, along with many others You will perform during Your residence in Dvārakā. These pastimes are glorified on this earth in the songs of transcendental poets.

Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires.

So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can't give up talking about Him.

api—certainly; bata—regrettable; madhu-puryām—in the city of Mathurā; ārya-putraḥ—the son of Nanda Mahārāja; adhunā—now; āste—resides; smarati—remembers; saḥ—He; pitṛ-gehān—the household affairs of His father; saumya—O great soul (Uddhava); bandhūn—His friends; ca—and; gopān—the cowherd boys; kvacit—sometimes; api—or; saḥ—He; kathāḥ—talks; naḥ—of us; kiṅkarīṇām—of the maidservants; gṛṇīte—relates; bhujam—hand; aguru-su-gandham—having the fragrance of aguru; mūrdhni—on the head; adhāsyat—will keep; kadā—when; nu—maybe.
O Uddhava! It is indeed regrettable that Kṛṣṇa resides in Mathurā. Does He remember His father's household affairs and His friends, the cowherd boys? O great soul! Does He ever talk about us, His maidservants? When will He lay on our heads His aguru-scented hand?

etāḥ paraṁ tanu-bhṛto bhuvi gopa-vadhvo

vāñchanti yad bhava-bhiyo munayo vayaṁ ca
kiṁ brahma-janmabhir ananta-kathā-rasasya
etāḥ—these women; param—alone; tanu—their bodies; bhṛtaḥ—maintain successfully; bhuvi—on the earth; gopa-vadhvaḥ—the young cowherd women; govinde—for Lord Kṛṣṇa; eva—exclusively; nikhila—of all; ātmani—the Soul; rūḍha—perfected; bhāvāḥ—ecstatic loving attraction; vāñchanti—they desire; yat—which; bhava—material existence; bhiyaḥ—those who are afraid of; munayaḥ—sages; vayam—we; ca—also; kim—what use; brahma—as a brāhmaṇa or as Lord Brahmā; janmabhiḥ—with births; ananta—of the unlimited Lord; kathā—for the topics; rasasya—for one who has a taste.
[Uddhava sang:] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brāhmaṇa, or even as Lord Brahmā himself?

kva—where, in comparison; imāḥ—these; striyaḥ—women; vana—in the forests; carīḥ—who wander; vyabhicāra—by improper behavior; duṣṭāḥ—contaminated; kṛṣṇe—for Kṛṣṇa; kva ca—and where; eṣaḥ—this; parama-ātmani—for the Supreme Soul; rūḍha-bhāvaḥ—stage of perfect love (known technically as mahā-bhāva); nanu—certainly; īśvaraḥ—the Personality of Godhead; anubhajataḥ—to one who constantly worships Him; aviduṣaḥ—not learned; api—even though; sākṣāt—directly; śreyaḥ—the highest good; tanoti—bestows; agada—of medicines; rājaḥ—the king (namely, the nectar which the demigods drink for long life); iva—as if; upayuktaḥ—taken.
How amazing it is that these simple women who wander about the forest, seemingly spoiled by improper behavior, have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul! Still, it is true that the Supreme Lord Himself awards His blessings even to an ignorant worshiper, just as the best medicine works even when taken by a person ignorant of its ingredients.

When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced by the arms of the Lord. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Indeed, never was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the beauty and fragrance of a lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to material estimation?

The gopīs of Vṛndāvana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to become one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vṛndāvana, because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.

The goddess of fortune herself, along with Lord Brahmā and all the other demigods, who are masters of yogic perfection, can worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa only within her mind. But during the rāsa dance Lord Kṛṣṇa placed His feet upon these gopīs' breasts, and by embracing those feet the gopīs gave up all distress.

I repeatedly offer my respects to the dust from the feet of the women of Nanda Mahārāja's cowherd village. When these gopīs loudly chant the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the vibration purifies the three worlds.

Since it has never been demonstrated that You are covered by material, bodily designations, it must be concluded that for You there is neither birth in a literal sense nor any duality. Therefore You never undergo bondage or liberation, and if You appear to, it is only because of Your desire that we see You in that way, or simply because of our lack of discrimination.

Śrī Rukmiṇī said: Actually, what You have said is true, O lotus-eyed one. I am indeed unsuitable for the almighty Personality of Godhead. What comparison is there between that Supreme Lord, who is master of the three primal deities and who delights in His own glory, and myself, a woman of mundane qualities whose feet are grasped by fools?

Yes, my Lord Urukrama, You lay down within the ocean as if afraid of the material modes, and thus in pure consciousness You appear within the heart as the Supersoul. You are always battling against the foolish material senses, and indeed even Your servants reject the privilege of royal dominion, which leads to the blindness of ignorance.

You possess nothing because there is nothing beyond You. Even the great enjoyers of tribute—Brahmā and other demigods—pay tribute to You. Those who are blinded by their wealth and absorbed in gratifying their senses do not recognize You in the form of death. But to the gods, the enjoyers of tribute, You are the most dear, as they are to You.

You are the embodiment of all human goals and are Yourself the final aim of life. Desiring to attain You, O all-powerful Lord, intelligent persons abandon everything else. It is they who are worthy of Your association, not men and women absorbed in the pleasure and grief resulting from their mutual lust.

Knowing that great sages who have renounced the sannyāsī's daṇḍa proclaim Your glories, that You are the Supreme Soul of all the worlds, and that You are so gracious that You give away even Your own self, I chose You as my husband, rejecting Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the rulers of heaven, whose aspirations are all frustrated by the force of time, which is born from Your eyebrows. What interest, then, could I have in any other suitors?

My Lord, as a lion drives away lesser animals to claim his proper tribute, You drove off the assembled kings with the resounding twang of Your Śārṅga bow and then claimed me, Your fair share. Thus it is sheer foolishness, my dear Gadāgraja, for You to say You took shelter in the ocean out of fear of those kings.

Indeed, the humanlike pastimes of the Almighty are simply a pretense! Effortlessly, He alone sends forth from His Self this variegated creation, maintains it and then swallows it up again, all without becoming entangled, just as the element earth takes on many names and forms in its various transformations.

But only those who render You wholehearted devotional service and in this way vanquish the soul's covering—the material mind—attain You as their final destination. Therefore kindly show mercy to us, Your devotees.

Thus everything active in the material world is set into motion by the Supreme Lord.

Indeed, while still in the maternity room You told us that You, the unborn Lord, had already been born several times as our son in previous ages. After manifesting each of these transcendental bodies to protect Your own principles of religion, You then made them unmanifest, thus appearing and disappearing like a cloud. O supremely glorified, all-pervading Lord, who can understand the mystic, deluding potency of Your opulent expansions?

Many who had been constantly absorbed in enmity toward You ultimately became attracted to You, who are the direct embodiment of transcendental goodness and whose divine form comprises the revealed scriptures. These reformed enemies include Daityas, Dānavas, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyādharas, Cāraṇas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Piśācas, Bhūtas, Pramathas and Nāyakas, and also ourselves and many others like us. Some of us have become attracted to You because of exceptional hatred, while others have become attracted because of their mood of devotion based on lust. But the demigods and others infatuated by material goodness feel no such attraction for You.

Let me offer my obeisances unto You. You are realized as the Supreme Soul by those who know the Absolute Truth, whereas in Your form of time You impose death upon the forgetful souls. You appear both in Your causeless spiritual form and in the created form of this universe, thus simultaneously uncovering the eyes of Your devotees and obstructing the vision of the nondevotees.

śrī-śrutayaḥ ūcuḥ—the Vedas said; jayajaya—victory to You, victory to You; jahi—please defeat; ajām—the eternal illusory potency of Māyā; ajita—O unconquerable one; doṣa—to create discrepancies; gṛbhīta—who has assumed; guṇām—the qualities of matter; tvam—You; asi—are; yat—because; ātmanā—in Your original status; samavaruddha—complete; samasta—in all; bhagaḥ—opulences; aga—nonmoving; jagat—and moving; okasām—of those who possess material bodies; akhila—of all; śakti—the energies; avabodhaka—O You who awaken; te—You; kvacit—sometimes; ajayā—with Your material energy; ātmanā—and with Your internal, spiritual energy; ca—also; carataḥ—engaging; anucaret—can appreciate; nigamaḥ—the Vedas.
The śrutis said: Victory, victory to You, O unconquerable one! By Your very nature You are perfectly full in all opulences; therefore please defeat the eternal power of illusion, who assumes control over the modes of nature to create difficulties for conditioned souls. O You who awaken all the energies of the moving and nonmoving embodied beings, sometimes the Vedas can recognize You as You sport with Your material and spiritual potencies.

bṛhat—as the Supreme; upalabdham—perceived; etat—this (world); avayanti—they consider; avaśeṣatayā—in terms of its being the all-pervading foundation of existence; yataḥ—since; udaya—the generation; astamayau—and dissolution; vikṛteḥ—of a transformation; mṛdi—of clay; vā—as if; avikṛtāt—(the Supreme itself) not being subject to transformation; ataḥ—therefore; ṛṣayaḥ—the sages (who compiled the Vedic mantras); dadhuḥ—placed; tvayi—in You; manaḥ—their minds; vacana—words; ācaritam—and actions; katham—how; ayathā—not as they are; bhavanti—become; bhuvi—upon the ground; datta—placed; padāni—the steps; nṛṇām—of men.
This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence, remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all, how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?

Therefore, O master of the three worlds, the wise get rid of all misery by diving deep into the nectarean ocean of topics about You, which washes away all the contamination of the universe. Then what to speak of those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature, O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?

Only if they become Your faithful followers are those who breathe actually alive; otherwise their breathing is like that of a bellows. It is by Your mercy alone that the elements, beginning with the mahat-tattva and false ego, created the egg of this universe. Among the manifestations known as anna-maya and so forth, You are the ultimate one, entering within the material coverings along with the living entity and assuming the same forms as those he takes. Distinct from the gross and subtle material manifestations, You are the reality underlying them all.

Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of the abdomen, while the Āruṇis worship Him as present in the heart, in the subtle center from which all the prāṇic channels emanate. From there, O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then, passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world, into the mouth of death.

Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among all these impermanent life forms.

The individual living entity, while inhabiting the material bodies he has created for himself by his karma, actually remains uncovered by either gross or subtle matter. This is so because, as the Vedas describe, he is part and parcel of You, the possessor of all potencies. Having determined this to be the status of the living entity, learned sages become imbued with faith and worship Your lotus feet, to which all Vedic sacrifices in this world are offered, and which are the source of liberation.

My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet.

tvad-anupathaṁ kulāyam idam ātma-suhṛt-priya-vac
carati tathonmukhe tvayi hite priya ātmani ca
na bata ramanty aho asad-upāsanayātma-hano
yad-anuśayā bhramanty uru-bhaye ku-śarīra-bhṛtaḥ
tvat—You; anupatham—useful for serving; kulāyam—body; idam—this; ātma—self; suhṛt—friend; priya—and beloved; vat—as; carati—acts; tathā—nevertheless; unmukhe—who are favorably disposed; tvayi—in You; hite—who are helpful; priye—who are affectionate; ātmani—who are their very Self; ca—and; na—not; bata—alas; ramanti—they take pleasure; aho—ah; asat—of the unreal; upāsanayā—by worship; ātma—themselves; hanaḥ—killing; yat—in which (worship of the unreal); anuśayāḥ—whose persistent desires; bhramanti—they wander; uru—greatly; bhaye—in the fearful (material existence); ku—degraded; śarīra—bodies; bhṛtaḥ—carrying.
When this human body is used for Your devotional service, it acts as one's self, friend and beloved. But unfortunately, although You always show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.

nibhṛta—brought under control; marut—with breathing; manaḥ—mind; akṣa—and senses; dṛḍha-yoga—in steadfast yoga; yujaḥ—engaged; hṛdi—in the heart; yat—which; munayaḥ—sages; upāsate—worship; tat—that; arayaḥ—enemies; api—also; yayuḥ—attained; smaraṇāt—by remembering; striyaḥ—women; uraga-indra—of lordly serpents; bhoga—(like) the bodies; bhuja—whose arms; daṇḍa—rodlike; viṣakta—attracted; dhiyaḥ—whose minds; vayam—we; api—also; te—to You; samāḥ—equal; sama—equal; dṛśaḥ—whose vision; aṅghri—of the feet; saroja—lotuslike; sudhāḥ—(relishing) the nectar.
Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we śrutis, who generally see You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts in the same way.

kaḥ—who; iha—in this world; nu—indeed; veda—knows; bata—ah; avara—recent; janma—whose birth; layaḥ—and annihilation; agra-saram—who came first; yataḥ—from whom; udagāt—arose; ṛṣiḥ—the learned sage, Brahmā; yam anu—following whom (Brahmā); deva-gaṇāḥ—the groups of demigods; ubhaye—both (those who control the senses and those who live in the regions above the heavenly planets); tarhi—at that time; na—no; sat—gross matter; na—no; ca—also; asat—subtle matter; ubhayam—that which is comprised of both (namely, the material bodies); na ca—nor; kāla—of time; javaḥ—the flow; kim api na—none at all; tatra—there; śāstram—authoritative scripture; avakṛṣya—withdrawing; śayīta—(the Supreme Lord) lies down; yadā—when.
Everyone in this world has recently been born and will soon die. So how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahmā, and all subsequent demigods, both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything within Himself, nothing else remains—no gross or subtle matter or bodies composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.

janim—creation; asataḥ—of the manifest world (from atoms); sataḥ—of that which is eternal; mṛtim—destruction; uta—also; ātmani—in the soul; ye—who; ca—and; bhidām—duality; vipaṇam—mundane business; ṛtam—real; smaranti—declare authoritatively; upadiśanti—teach; te—they; ārupitaiḥ—in terms of illusions imposed on reality; tri—three; guṇa—of the material modes; mayaḥ—composed; pumān—the living entity; iti—thus; bhidā—dualistic conception; yat—which; abodha—by ignorance; kṛtā—created; tvayi—in You; na—not; tataḥ—to such; paratra—transcendental; saḥ—that (ignorance); bhavet—can exist; avabodha—total consciousness; rase—whose composition.
Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed, that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter, or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always enjoy perfect, total awareness.

na hi vikṛtiṁ tyajanti kanakasya tad-ātmatayā
sva-kṛtam anupraviṣṭam idam ātmatayāvasitam
sat—real; iva—as if; manaḥ—the mind (and its manifestations); tri-vṛt—threefold (by the modes of material nature); tvayi—in You; vibhāti—appears; asat—unreal; ā-manujāt—extending to the human beings; sat—as real; abhimṛśanti—they consider; aśeṣam—entire; idam—this (world); ātmatayā—as nondifferent from the Self; ātma-vidaḥ—the knowers of the Self; na—not; hi—indeed; vikṛtim—the transformations; tyajanti—reject; kanakasya—of gold; tat-ātmatayā—inasmuch as they are nondifferent from it; sva—by Himself; kṛtam—created; anupraviṣṭam—and entered; idam—this; ātmatayā—as nondifferent from Himself; avasitam—ascertained.
The three modes of material nature comprise everything in this world—from the simplest phenomena to the complex human body. Although these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still, those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord who created it and then entered within it.

tava pari ye caranty akhila-sattva-niketatayā
ta uta padākramanty avigaṇayya śiro nirṛteḥ
parivayase paśūn iva girā vibudhān api tāṁs

tava—You; pari ye caranti—who worship; akhila—of all; sattva—created entities; niketatayā—as the shelter; te—they; uta—simply; padā—with their feet; ākramanti—step upon; avigaṇayya—disregarding; śiraḥ—the head; nirṛteḥ—of Death; parivayase—You tie up; paśūn iva—like animals; girā—with Your words (of the Vedas); vibudhān—wise; api—even; tān—them; tvayi—to whom; kṛta—those who have made; sauhṛdāḥ—friendship; khalu—indeed; punanti—purify; na—not; ye—who; vimukhāḥ—inimical.
The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves and others, not those who are inimical to You.

tvam—You; akaraṇaḥ—devoid of material senses; sva-rāṭ—self-effulgent; akhila—of all; kāraka—sensory functions; śakti—of the potencies; dharaḥ—the maintainer; tava—Your; balim—tribute; udvahanti—carry; samadanti—and partake of; ajayā—along with material nature; animiṣāḥ—the demigods; varṣa—of districts of a kingdom; bhujaḥ—the rulers; akhila—entire; kṣiti—of the land; pateḥ—of the lord; iva—as if; viśva—of the universe; sṛjaḥ—the creators; vidadhati—execute; yatra—in which; ye—they; tu—indeed; adhikṛtā—assigned; bhavataḥ—of You; cakitāḥ—afraid.
Though You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent sustainer of everyone's sensory powers. The demigods and material nature herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land, while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services out of fear of You.

sthira—stationary; cara—and moving; jātayaḥ—species of life; syuḥ—become manifest; ajayā—with the material energy; uttha—awakened; nimitta—their motivations for activity (and the subtle bodies activated by such); yujaḥ—assuming; viharaḥ—sport; udīkṣayā—by Your brief glance; yadi—if; parasya—of Him who is aloof; vimukta—O eternally liberated one; tataḥ—from her; na—not; hi—indeed; paramasya—for the supreme; kaścit—anyone; aparaḥ—not foreign; na—nor; paraḥ—foreign; ca—also; bhavet—can be; viyataḥ—for the ethereal sky; iva—as if; apadasya—which has no perceptible qualities; tava—for You; śūnya—to a void; tulām—a resemblance; dadhataḥ—who take on.
O eternally liberated, transcendental Lord, Your material energy causes the various moving and nonmoving species of life to appear by activating their material desires, but only when and if You sport with her by briefly glancing at her. You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, see no one as an intimate friend and no one as a stranger, just as the ethereal sky has no connection with perceptible qualities. In this sense You resemble a void.

aparimitāḥ—countless; dhruvāḥ—permanent; tanu-bhṛtaḥ—the embodied living entities; yadi—if; sarva-gatāḥ—omnipresent; tarhi—then; na—not; śāsyatā—sovereignty; iti—such; niyamaḥ—rule; dhruva—O unchanging one; na—not; itarathā—otherwise; ajani—was generated; ca—and; yat-mayam—from whose substance; tat—from that; avimucya—not separating itself; niyantṛ—regulator; bhavet—must be; samam—equally present; anujānatām—of those who supposedly know; yat—which; amatam—misunderstood; mata—of what is known; duṣṭatayā—because of the imperfection.
If the countless living entities were all-pervading and possessed forms that never changed, You could not possibly be their absolute ruler, O immutable one. But since they are Your localized expansions and their forms are subject to change, You do control them. Indeed, that which supplies the ingredients for the generation of something is necessarily its controller because a product never exists apart from its ingredient cause. It is simply illusion for someone to think that he knows the Supreme Lord, who is equally present in each of His expansions, since whatever knowledge one gains by material means must be imperfect.

na ghaṭate—does not happen; udbhavaḥ—the generation; prakṛti—of material nature; pūruṣayoḥ—and of the soul who is her enjoyer; ajayoḥ—who are unborn; ubhaya—of both; yujā—by the combination; bhavanti—come into being; asu-bhṛtaḥ—living bodies; jala—on water; budbuda—bubbles; vat—like; tvayi—in You; te ime—these (living beings); tataḥ—therefore; vividha—various; nāma—with names; guṇaiḥ—and qualities; parame—in the Supreme; saritaḥ—rivers; iva—as; arṇave—within the ocean; madhuni—in honey; lilyuḥ—become merged; aśeṣa—all; rasāḥ—flavors.
Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey, so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.

nṛṣu—among humans; tava—Your; māyayā—by the illusory energy; bhramam—bewilderment; amīṣu—among these; avagatya—understanding; bhṛśam—fervent; tvayi—unto You; su-dhiyaḥ—those who are wise; abhave—unto the source of liberation; dadhati—render; bhāvam—loving service; anuprabhavam—potent; katham—how; anuvartatām—for those who follow You faithfully; bhava—of material life; bhayam—fear; tava—Your; yat—since; bhru—of the eyebrows; kuṭiḥ—the furrowing; sṛjati—creates; muhuḥ—repeatedly; tri-nemiḥ—three-rimmed (in the three phases of time, namely past, present and future); a—not; bhavat—from You; śaraṇeṣu—for those who take shelter; bhayam—fear.
The wise souls who understand how Your Māyā deludes all human beings render potent loving service to You, who are the source of liberation from birth and death. How, indeed, can fear of material life affect Your faithful servants? On the other hand, Your furrowing eyebrows—the triple-rimmed wheel of time—repeatedly terrify those who refuse to take shelter of You.

vijita—conquered; hṛṣīka—with senses; vāyubhiḥ—and vital air; adānta—not brought under control; manaḥ—the mind; tura-gam—(which is like) a horse; ye—those who; iha—in this world; yatanti—endeavor; yantum—to regulate; ati—very; lolam—unsteady; upāya—by their various methods of cultivation; khidaḥ—distressed; vyasana—disturbances; śata—by hundreds; anvitāḥ—joined; samavahāya—abandoning; guroḥ—of the spiritual master; caraṇam—the feet; vaṇijaḥ—merchants; iva—as if; aja—O unborn one; santi—they are; akṛta—having not taken; karṇa-dharāḥ—a helmsman; jala-dhau—on the ocean.
The mind is like an impetuous horse that even persons who have regulated their senses and breath cannot control. Those in this world who try to tame the uncontrolled mind, but who abandon the feet of their spiritual master, encounter hundreds of obstacles in their cultivation of various distressful practices. O unborn Lord, they are like merchants on a boat in the ocean who have failed to employ a helmsman.

svajana—with servants; suta—children; ātma—body; dāra—wife; dhana—money; dhāma—home; dharā—land; asu—vitality; rathaiḥ—and vehicles; tvayi—when You; sati—have become; kim—what (use); nṛṇām—for human beings; śrayataḥ—who are taking shelter; ātmani—their very Self; sarva-rase—the embodiment of all pleasures; iti—thus; sat—the truth; ajānatām—for those who fail to appreciate; mithunataḥ—from sexual combinations; rataye—for sensual indulgence; caratām—carrying on; sukhayati—gives happiness; kaḥ—what; nu—at all; iha—in this (world); sva—by its very nature; vihate—which is subject to destruction; sva—by its very nature; nirasta—which is devoid; bhage—of any essence.
To those persons who take shelter of You, You reveal Yourself as the Supersoul, the embodiment of all transcendental pleasure. What further use have such devotees for their servants, children or bodies, their wives, money or houses, their land, good health or conveyances? And for those who fail to appreciate the truth about You and go on pursuing the pleasures of sex, what could there be in this entire world—a place inherently doomed to destruction and devoid of significance—that could give them real happiness?

bhuvi—on the earth; puru—greatly; puṇya—pious; tīrtha—places of pilgrimage; sadanāni—and personal abodes of the Supreme Lord; ṛṣayaḥ—sages; vimadaḥ—free from false pride; te—they; uta—indeed; bhavat—Your; pada—feet; ambuja—lotus; hṛdaḥ—in whose hearts; agha—sins; bhit—which destroys; aṅghri—(having bathed) whose feet; jalāḥ—the water; dadhati—turn; sakṛt—even once; manaḥ—their minds; tvayi—toward You; ye—who; ātmani—toward the Supreme Soul; nitya—always; sukhe—who is happy; na punaḥ—never again; upāsate—they worship; puruṣa—of a man; sāra—the essential qualities; hara—which steal away; āvasathān—their mundane homes.
Sages free from false pride live on this earth by frequenting the sacred pilgrimage sites and those places where the Supreme Lord displayed His pastimes. Because such devotees keep Your lotus feet within their hearts, the water that washes their feet destroys all sins. Anyone who even once turns his mind toward You, the ever-blissful Soul of all existence, no longer dedicates himself to serving family life at home, which simply robs a man of his good qualities.

sataḥ—from that which is permanent; idam—this (universe); utthitam—arisen; sat—permanent; iti—thus; cet—if (someone proposes); nanu—certainly; tarka—by logical contradiction; hatam—refuted; vyabhicarati—it is inconsistent; kva ca—in some cases; kva ca—in other cases; mṛṣā—illusion; na—not; tathā—so; ubhaya—of both (the real and illusion); yuk—the conjunction; vyavahṛtaye—for the sake of ordinary affairs; vikalpaḥ—an imaginary situation; iṣitaḥ—desired; andha—of blind men; paramparayā—by a succession; bhramayati—bewilder; bhāratī—the words of wisdom; te—Your; uru—numerous; vṛttibhiḥ—with their semantic functions; uktha—by ritual utterances; jaḍān—dulled.
It may be proposed that this world is permanently real because it is generated from the permanent reality, but such an argument is subject to logical refutation. Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their material affairs. With their various meanings and implications, the learned words of Your Vedas bewilder all persons whose minds have been dulled by hearing the incantations of sacrificial rituals.

na—not; yat—because; idam—this (universe); agre—in the beginning; āsa—existed; na bhaviṣyat—it will not exist; ataḥ—hence; nidhanāt anu—after its annihilation; mitam—deduced; antarā—in the meantime; tvayi—within You; vibhāti—it appears; mṛṣā—false; ekarase—whose experience of spiritual ecstasy is unchanging; ataḥ—thus; upamīyate—it is understood by comparison; draviṇa—of material substance; jāti—in the categories; vikalpa—of the transformations; pathaiḥ—with the varieties; vitatha—contrary to fact; manaḥ—of the mind; vilāsam—fantasy; ṛtam—real; iti—so; avayanti—think; abudhaḥ—the unintelligent.
Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe to the transformation of various material substances into diverse forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination is substantially real are less intelligent.

saḥ—he (the individual living entity); yat—because; ajayā—by the influence of the material energy; tu—but; ajām—that material energy; anuśayīta—lies down next to; guṇān—her qualities; ca—and; juṣan—assuming; bhajati—he takes on; sa-rūpatām—forms resembling (the qualities of nature); tat-anu—following that; mṛtyum—death; apeta—deprived; bhagaḥ—of his assets; tvam—You; uta—on the other hand; jahāsi—leave aside; tām—her (the material energy); ahiḥ—a snake; iva—as if; tvacam—its (old, discarded) skin; ātta-bhagaḥ—endowed with all assets; mahasi—in Your spiritual powers; mahīyase—You are glorified; aṣṭa-guṇite—eightfold; aparimeya—unlimited; bhagaḥ—whose greatness.
The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.

yadi—if; na samuddharanti—they do not uproot; yatayaḥ—persons in the renounced order of life; hṛdi—in their hearts; kāma—of material desire; jaṭāḥ—the traces; duradhigamaḥ—impossible to be realized; asatām—for the impure; hṛdi—in the heart; gataḥ—having entered; asmṛta—forgotten; kaṇṭha—on one's neck; maṇiḥ—a jewel; asu—their life airs; tṛpa—who gratify; yoginām—for practitioners of yoga; ubhayataḥ—in both (worlds); api—even; asukham—unhappiness; bhagavan—O Personality of Godhead; anapagata—not gone away; antakāt—from death; anadhirūḍha—unobtained; padāt—whose kingdom; bhavataḥ—from You.
Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts, for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a man who has totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who practice yoga only for sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next: from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they cannot reach.

tvat—You; avagamī—one who understands; na vetti—does not pay regard; bhavat—from You; uttha—rising; śubha-aśubhayoḥ—of the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness; guṇa-viguṇa—of good and bad; anvayān—to the attributions; tarhi—consequently; deha-bhṛtām—of embodied living beings; ca—also; giraḥ—the words; anu-yugam—in every age; anu-aham—every day; sa-guṇa—O You who are endowed with qualities; gīta—of recitation; paramparayā—by the chain of succession; śravaṇa—through hearing; bhṛtaḥ—carried; yataḥ—because of this; tvam—You; apavarga—of liberation; gatiḥ—the ultimate goal; manujaiḥ—by human beings, descendants of Manu.
When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu's descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation.

Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion.

[Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu said:] I brought the brāhmaṇa's sons here because I wanted to see the two of you, My expansions, who have descended to the earth to save the principles of religion. As soon as you finish killing the demons who burden the earth, quickly come back here to Me.

tīrtham—sacred place of pilgrimage; cakre—made; nṛpa—O King (Parīkṣit); ūnam—lesser; yat—which (glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa); ajani—He took birth; yaduṣu—among the Yadus; svaḥ—of heaven; sarit—the river; pāda—whose feet; śaucam—(the water) which washes; vidviṭ—enemies; snigdhāḥ—and loved ones; svarūpam—whose personal form; yayuḥ—attained; ajita—who is undefeated; parā—and supremely perfect; śrīḥ—the goddess of fortune; yat—whose; arthe—for the sake; anya—of others; yatnaḥ—endeavor; yat—whose; nāma—name; amaṅgala—inauspiciousness; ghnam—which destroys; śrutam—heard; atha—or else; gaditam—chanted; yat—by whom; kṛtaḥ—created; gotra—among the lines of descent (of various sages); dharmaḥ—the religious principles; kṛṣṇasya—for Lord Kṛṣṇa; etat—this; na—not; citram—wonderful; kṣiti—the earth's; bhara—of the burden; haraṇam—the removal; kāla—of time; cakra—the wheel; āyudhasya—whose weapon.
The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord Kṛṣṇa's feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated Kṛṣṇa and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?

sthira-cara-vṛjina-ghnaḥ su-smita-śrī-mukhena
vraja-pura-vanitānāṁ vardhayan kāma-devam
jayati—eternally lives gloriously; jana-nivāsaḥ—He who lives among human beings like the members of the Yadu dynasty and is the ultimate resort of all living entities; devakī-janma-vādaḥ—known as the son of Devakī (No one can actually become the father or mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore devakī-janma-vada means that He is known as the son of Devakī. Similarly, He is also known as the son of Mother Yaśodā, Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja.); yadu-vara-pariṣat—served by the members of the Yadu dynasty or the cowherd men of Vṛndāvana (all of whom are constant associates of the Supreme Lord and are the Lord's eternal servants); svaiḥ dorbhiḥ—by His own arms, or by His devotees like Arjuna who are just like His own arms; asyan—killing; adharmam—demons or the impious; sthira-cara-vṛjina-ghnaḥ—the destroyer of all the ill fortune of all living entities, moving and not moving; su-smita—always smiling; śrī-mukhena—by His beautiful face; vraja-pura-vanitānām—of the damsels of Vṛndāvana; vardhayan—increasing; kāma-devam—the lusty desires.
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is He who is known as jana-nivāsa, the ultimate resort of all living entities, and who is also known as Devakīnandana or Yaśodā-nandana, the son of Devakī and Yaśodā. He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious. By His presence He destroys all things inauspicious for all living entities, moving and inert. His blissful smiling face always increases the lusty desires of the gopīs of Vṛndāvana. May He be all glorious and happy!

To protect the principles of devotional service to Himself, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the best of the Yadus, accepts the pastime forms that have been glorified here in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. One who desires to faithfully serve His lotus feet should hear of the activities He performs in each of these incarnations—activities that suitably imitate those of the forms He assumes. Hearing narrations of these pastimes destroys the reactions to fruitive work.

By regularly hearing, chanting and meditating on the beautiful topics of Lord Mukunda with ever-increasing sincerity, a mortal being will attain the divine kingdom of the Lord, where the inviolable power of death holds no sway. For this purpose, many persons, including great kings, abandoned their mundane homes and took to the forest.

tvām—You; sevatām—for those who are serving; sura-kṛtāḥ—made by the demigods; bahavaḥ—many; antarāyāḥ—disturbances; sva-okaḥ—their own abode (the planets of the demigods); vilaṅghya—crossing beyond; paramam—the supreme; vrajatām—who are going; padam—to the abode; te—Your; na—there are not such; anyasya—for another; barhiṣi—in ritual sacrifices; balīn—offerings; dadataḥ—for one who is giving; sva-bhāgān—their own shares (of the demigods); dhatte—(the devotee) places; padam—his foot; tvam—You; avitā—the protector; yadi—because; vighna—of the disturbance; mūrdhni—upon the head.
The demigods place many obstacles on the path of those who worship You to transcend the temporary abodes of the demigods and reach Your supreme abode. Those who offer the demigods their assigned shares in sacrificial performances encounter no such obstacles. But because You are the direct protector of Your devotee, he is able to step over the head of whatever obstacle the demigods place before him.

Some men practice severe penances to cross beyond our influence, which is like an immeasurable ocean with endless waves of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and the other conditions brought about by the passing of time, such as the sensuous wind and the urges of the tongue and sex organs. Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.

Dedicating our intelligence, senses, vital air, mind and power of speech to Your Lordship, we demigods bow down at Your lotus feet.

O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain and devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent of māyā, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never affected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal spiritual bliss, and thus You cannot be accused of any material infection.

Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. May Your lotus feet become the blazing fire that burns to ashes all our inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.

O almighty Lord, You are so kind to Your servants that You have accepted the withered flower garland that we have placed on Your chest. Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lakṣmī and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.

O omnipotent Lord, in Your incarnation as Trivikrama, You raised Your leg like a flagpole to break the shell of the universe, allowing the holy Ganges to flow down, like a banner of victory, in three branches throughout the three planetary systems. By three mighty steps of Your lotus feet, Your Lordship captured Bali Mahārāja, along with his universal kingdom. Your lotus feet inspire fear in the demons by driving them down to hell and fearlessness among Your devotees by elevating them to the perfection of heavenly life. We are sincerely trying to worship You, our Lord; therefore may Your lotus feet kindly free us from all of our sinful reactions.

All of the great demigods, beginning with Brahmā, are embodied living entities. Struggling painfully with one another under the strict control of Your time factor, they are just like bulls dragged by ropes tied through their pierced noses.

Then the mahat-tattva, the amalgamated material energy, endowed with the potency of the Lord, produces from itself the primeval golden egg of the universe, which is covered by various layers of material elements.

O Lord, You are the supreme creator of this universe and the ultimate controller of all moving and nonmoving living entities. You are Hṛṣīkeśa, the supreme controller of all sensory activity, and thus You never become contaminated or entangled in the course of Your supervision of the infinite sensory activities within the material creation. On the other hand, other living entities, even yogīs and philosophers, are disturbed and frightened simply by remembering the material objects that they have supposedly renounced in their pursuit of enlightenment.

bhava—of material life; bhayam—the fear; apahantum—in order to take away; jñāna-vijñāna—of knowledge and self-realization; sāram—the essence; nigama—of the Vedas; kṛt—the author; upajahre—delivered; bhṛṅga-vat—like a bee; veda-sāram—the essential meaning of the Vedas; amṛtam—the nectar; udadhitaḥ—from the ocean; ca—and; apāyayat—made to drink; bhṛtya-vargān—His many devotees; puruṣam—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ṛṣabham—the greatest; ādyam—the first of all beings; kṛṣṇa-saṁjñam—named Lord Kṛṣṇa; nataḥ—bowed down; asmi—I am.
I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original and greatest of all beings, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is the author of the Vedas, and just to destroy His devotees' fear of material existence, like a bee He has collected this nectarean essence of all knowledge and self-realization. Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it.

apaśyatas tvac-caraṇāmbujaṁ prabho
dṛṣṭiḥ praṇaṣṭā tamasi praviṣṭā
diśo na jāne na labhe ca śāntiṁ

apaśyataḥ—of me, who am not seeing; tvat—Your; caraṇa-ambujam—lotus feet; prabho—O master; dṛṣṭiḥ—the power of vision; praṇaṣṭā—is destroyed; tamasi—into darkness; praviṣṭā—having entered; diśaḥ—the directions; na jāne—I do not know; na labhe—I cannot obtain; ca—and; śāntim—peace; yathā—just as; niśāyām—in the night; uḍupe—when the moon; praṇaṣṭe—has become new.
Dāruka said: Just as on a moonless night people are merged into darkness and cannot find their way, now that I have lost sight of Your lotus feet, my Lord, I have lost my vision and am wandering blindly in darkness. I cannot tell my direction, nor can I find any peace.

śrī-mārkaṇḍeya uvāca
kiṁ varṇaye tava vibho yad-udīrito 'suḥ
saṁspandate tam anu vāṅ-mana-indriyāṇi
spandanti vai tanu-bhṛtām aja-śarvayoś ca
svasyāpy athāpi bhajatām asi bhāva-bandhuḥ
śrī-mārkaṇḍeyaḥ uvāca—Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said; kim—what; varṇaye—shall I describe; tava—about You; vibho—O almighty Lord; yat—by whom; udīritaḥ—moved; asuḥ—the vital air; saṁspandate—comes to life; tam anu—following it; vāk—the power of speech; manaḥ—the mind; indriyāṇi—and the senses; spandanti—begin to act; vai—indeed; tanu-bhṛtām—of all embodied living beings; aja-śarvayoḥ—of Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva; ca—as well; svasya—of myself; api—also; atha api—nevertheless; bhajatām—for those who are worshiping; asi—You become; bhāva-bandhuḥ—the intimate loving friend.
Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said: O almighty Lord, how can I possibly describe You? You awaken the vital air, which then impels the mind, senses and power of speech to act. This is true for all ordinary conditioned souls and even for great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva. So it is certainly true for me. Nevertheless, You become the intimate friend of those who worship You.

mūrtī ime bhagavato bhagavaṁs tri-lokyāḥ
kṣemāya tāpa-viramāya ca mṛtyu-jityai

mūrtī—the two personal forms; ime—these; bhagavataḥ—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhagavan—O Lord; tri-lokyāḥ—of all the three worlds; kṣemāya—for the ultimate benefit; tāpa—of material misery; viramāya—for the cessation; ca—and; mṛtyu—of death; jityai—for the conquest; nānā—various; bibharṣi—You manifest; avitum—for the purpose of protecting; anya—other; tanūḥ—transcendental bodies; yathā—just as; idam—this universe; sṛṣṭvā—having created; punaḥ—once again; grasasi—You swallow up; sarvam—entirely; iva—just like; ūrṇa-nābhiḥ—a spider.
O Supreme Personality of Godhead, these two personal forms of Yours have appeared in order  to bestow the ultimate benefit for the three worlds—the cessation of material misery and the conquest of death. My Lord, although You create this universe and then assume many transcendental forms to protect it, You also swallow it up, just like a spider who spins and later withdraws its web.

Because You are the protector and the supreme controller of all moving and nonmoving beings, anyone who takes shelter of Your lotus feet can never be touched by the contamination of material work, material qualities or time. Great sages who have assimilated the essential meaning of the Vedaṣ offer their prayers to You. To gain Your association, they bow down to You at every opportunity and constantly worship You and meditate upon You.

My dear Lord, even Lord Brahmā, who enjoys his exalted position for the entire duration of the universe, fears the passage of time. Then what to speak of those whom Brahmā creates, the conditioned souls. They encounter fearful dangers at every step of their lives. I do not know of any relief from this fear except shelter at Your lotus feet, which are the very form of liberation.

Therefore I worship Your lotus feet, having renounced my identification with the material body and everything else that covers my true self. These useless, insubstantial and temporary coverings are merely presumed to be separate from You, whose intelligence encompasses all truth. By attaining You—the Supreme Godhead and the master of the soul—one attains everything desirable.

O my Lord, O supreme friend of the conditioned soul, although for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world You accept the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, which constitute Your illusory potency, You specifically employ the mode of goodness to liberate the conditioned souls. The other two modes simply bring them suffering, illusion and fear.

tasmāt—therefore; tava—Your; iha—in this world; bhagavan—O Supreme Lord; atha—and; tāvakānām—of Your devotees; śuklām—transcendental; tanum—the personal form; sva-dayitām—most dear to them; kuśalāḥ—those who are expert in spiritual knowledge; bhajanti—worship; yat—because; sātvatāḥ—the great devotees; puruṣa—of the original Personality of Godhead; rūpam—the form; uśanti—consider; sattvam—the mode of goodness; lokaḥ—the spiritual world; yataḥ—from which; abhayam—fearlessness; uta—and; ātma-sukham—the happiness of the soul; na—not; ca—and; anyat—any other.
O Lord, because fearlessness, spiritual happiness and the kingdom of God are all achieved through the mode of pure goodness, Your devotees consider this mode, but never passion and ignorance, to be a direct manifestation of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Intelligent persons thus worship Your beloved transcendental form, composed of pure goodness, along with the spiritual forms of Your pure devotees.

I offer my humble obeisances to Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the all-pervading and all-inclusive form of the universe, as well as its spiritual master. I bow down to Lord Nārāyaṇa, the supremely worshipable Deity appearing as a sage, and also to the saintly Nara, the best of human beings, who is fixed in perfect goodness, fully in control of his speech, and the propagator of the Vedic literatures.

yaṁ vai na veda vitathākṣa-pathair bhramad-dhīḥ

yam—whom; vai—indeed; na veda—does not recognize; vitatha—deceptive; akṣa-pathaiḥ—by methods of empirical perception; bhramat—becoming diverted; dhīḥ—whose intelligence; santam—present; svakeṣu—within one's own; asuṣu—senses; hṛdi—within the heart; api—even; dṛk-patheṣu—among perceived objects of the external world; tat-māyayā—by His illusory potency; āvṛta—covered over; matiḥ—his understanding; saḥ—he; u—even; eva—indeed; sākṣāt—directly; ādyaḥ—originally (in ignorance); tava—of You; akhila-guroḥ—the spiritual master of all living beings; upasādya—obtaining; vedam—the knowledge of the Vedas.
A materialist, his intelligence perverted by the action of his deceptive senses, cannot recognize You at all, although You are always present within his own senses and heart and also among the objects of his perception. Yet even though one's understanding has been covered by Your illusory potency, if one obtains Vedic knowledge from You, the supreme spiritual master of all, he can directly understand You.

My dear Lord, the Vedic literatures alone reveal confidential knowledge of Your supreme personality, and thus even such great scholars as Lord Brahmā himself are bewildered in their attempt to understand You through empirical methods. Each philosopher understands You according to his particular speculative conclusions. I worship that Supreme Person, knowledge of whom is hidden by the bodily designations covering the conditioned soul's spiritual identity.

Again and again I offer my obeisances unto you, O all-auspicious transcendental personality. As the lord of goodness you give pleasure, in contact with the mode of passion you appear most fearful, and you also associate with the mode of ignorance.

Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said: It is indeed most difficult for embodied souls to understand the pastimes of the universal controllers, for such lords bow down to and offer praise to the very living beings they rule.

Generally it is to induce embodied souls to accept religious principles that the authorized teachers of religion exhibit ideal behavior while encouraging and praising the proper behavior of others.

This apparent humility is simply a show of mercy. Such behavior of the Supreme Lord and His personal associates, which the Lord effects by His own bewildering potency, does not spoil His power any more than a magician's powers are diminished by his exhibition of tricks.

I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created this entire universe simply by His desire and then entered into it as the Supersoul. By making the modes of nature act, He seems to be the direct creator of this world, just as a dreamer seems to be acting within his dream. He is the owner and ultimate controller of the three modes of nature, yet He remains alone and pure, without any equal. He is the supreme spiritual master of all, the original personal form of the Absolute Truth.
