satya-vrataṁ satya-paraṁ tri-satyaṁ
satyasya yoniṁ nihitaṁ ca satye
satyasya satyam ṛta-satya-netraṁ
satyātmakaṁ tvāṁ śaraṇaṁ prapannāḥ
satya-vratam—the Personality of Godhead, who never deviates from His vow *; satya-param—who is the Absolute Truth (as stated in the beginning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi); tri-satyam—He is always present as the Absolute Truth, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, during its maintenance, and even after its annihilation; satyasya—of all relative truths, which are emanations from the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa; yonim—the cause; nihitam—entered *; ca—and; satye—in the factors that create this material world (namely, the five elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether); satyasya—of all that is accepted as the truth; satyam—the Lord is the original truth; ṛta-satya-netram—He is the origin of whatever truth is pleasing (sunetram); satya-ātmakam—everything pertaining to the Lord is truth (sac-cid-ānanda: His body is truth, His knowledge is truth, and His pleasure is truth); tvām—unto you, O Lord; śaraṇam—offering our full surrender; prapannāḥ—we are completely under Your protection.
The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic manifestation—creation, maintenance and annihilation—You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antaryāmī, the inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.

ekāyano 'sau dvi-phalas tri-mūlaś
catū-rasaḥ pañca-vidhaḥ ṣaḍ-ātmā
sapta-tvag aṣṭa-viṭapo navākṣo
daśa-cchadī dvi-khago hy ādi-vṛkṣaḥ
eka-ayanaḥ—the body of an ordinary living being is fully dependent on the material elements; asau—that; dvi-phalaḥ—in this body we are subject to material happiness and distress, which result from karma; tri-mūlaḥ—having three roots, the three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), upon which the body is created;  catuḥ-rasaḥ—four rasas, or tastes; pañca-vidhaḥ—consisting of five senses for acquiring knowledge (the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch); ṣaṭ-ātmā—six circumstances (lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst); sapta-tvak—having seven coverings (skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen); aṣṭa-viṭapaḥ—eight branches (the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and also the mind, intelligence and ego); nava-akṣaḥ—nine holes; daśa-chadī—ten kinds of life air, resembling the leaves of a tree; dvi-khagaḥ—two birds (the individual soul and the Supersoul); hi—indeed; ādi-vṛkṣaḥ -this is the original tree or construction of the material body, whether individual or universal.
The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called "the original tree." From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit—the enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association with the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four tastes—religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation—which are experienced through five senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements—earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows—the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the rectum and the genitals—and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.

tvam eka evāsya sataḥ prasūtis
tvaṁ sannidhānaṁ tvam anugrahaś ca
tvan-māyayā saṁvṛta-cetasas tvāṁ
paśyanti nānā na vipaścito ye
tvam—You (O Lord); ekaḥ—being one without a second, You are everything; eva—indeed; asya sataḥ—of this cosmic manifestation now visible; prasūtiḥ—the original source; tvam—Your Lordship; sannidhānam—the conservation of all such energy when everything is annihilated; tvam—Your Lordship; anugrahaḥ ca—and the maintainer; tvat-māyayā—by Your illusory, external energy; saṁvṛta-cetasaḥ—those whose intelligence is covered by such illusory energy; tvām—unto You; paśyanti—observe; nānā—many varieties; na—not; vipaścitaḥ—learned scholars or devotees; ye—who are.
The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord. You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is not the vision of learned devotees.

bibharṣi rūpāṇy avabodha ātmā
kṣemāya lokasya carācarasya
sattvopapannāni sukhāvahāni
satām abhadrāṇi muhuḥ khalānām
bibharṣi—You accept; rūpāṇi—varieties of forms, such as Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Rāma and Nṛsiṁha; avabodhaḥ ātmā—in spite of having different incarnations, You remain the Supreme, full of knowledge; kṣemāya—for the benefit of everyone, and especially the devotees; lokasya—of all living entities; cara-acarasya—moving and nonmoving; sattva-upapannāni—all such incarnations are transcendental (śuddha-sattva); sukha-avahāni—full of transcendental bliss; satām—of the devotees; abhadrāṇi—all inauspiciousness or annihilation; muhuḥ—again and again; khalānām—of the nondevotees.
O Lord, You are always in full knowledge, and to bring all good fortune to all living entities, You appear in different incarnations, all of them transcendental to the material creation. When You appear in these incarnations, You are pleasing to the pious and religious devotees, but for nondevotees You are the annihilator.

tvayy ambujākṣākhila-sattva-dhāmni
samādhināveśita-cetasaike
tvat-pāda-potena mahat-kṛtena
kurvanti govatsa-padaṁ bhavābdhim
tvayi—in You; ambuja-akṣa—O lotus-eyed Lord; akhila-sattva-dhāmni—who are the original cause of all existence, from whom everything emanates and in whom all potencies reside; samādhinā—by constant meditation and complete absorption (in thoughts of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead); āveśita—fully absorbed, fully engaged; cetasā—but by such a mentality; eke—the one process of always thinking of Your lotus feet; tvat-pāda-potena—by boarding such a boat as Your lotus feet; mahat-kṛtena—by that action which is considered the most powerful original existence or which is executed by mahājanas; kurvanti—they make; govatsa-padam—like the hoofprint of a calf; bhava-abdhim—the great ocean of nescience.
O lotus-eyed Lord, by concentrating one's meditation on Your lotus feet, which are the reservoir of all existence, and by accepting those lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of mahājanas [great saints, sages and devotees]. By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.

svayaṁ samuttīrya sudustaraṁ dyuman
bhavārṇavaṁ bhīmam adabhra-sauhṛdāḥ
bhavat-padāmbhoruha-nāvam atra te
nidhāya yātāḥ sad-anugraho bhavān
svayam—personally; samuttīrya—perfectly crossing; su-dustaram—which is very difficult to cross; dyuman—O Lord, who appear exactly like the sun, illuminating the darkness of this world of ignorance; bhava-arṇavam—the ocean of nescience; bhīmam—which is extremely fierce; adabhra-sauhṛdāḥ—devotees who are incessantly friendly to the fallen souls; bhavat-pada-ambhoruha—Your lotus feet; nāvam—the boat for crossing; atra—in this world; te—they (the Vaiṣṇavas); nidhāya—leaving behind; yātāḥ—on to the ultimate destination, Vaikuṇṭha; sat-anugrahaḥ—who are always kind and merciful to the devotees; bhavān—You.
O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore You are known as a desire tree [vāñchā-kalpataru]. When ācāryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.

ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas
tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ
āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ
patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ
ye anye—anyone else, or all others; aravinda-akṣa—O lotus-eyed one; vimukta-māninaḥ—falsely considering themselves free from the bondage of material contamination; tvayi—unto You; asta-bhāvāt—speculating in various ways but not knowing or desiring more information of Your lotus feet; aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ—whose intelligence is still not purified and who do not know the goal of life; āruhya—even though achieving; kṛcchreṇa—by undergoing severe austerities, penances and hard labor; param padam—the highest position (according to their imagination and speculation); tataḥ—from that position; patanti—they fall; adhaḥ—down into material existence again; anādṛta—neglecting devotion to; yuṣmat—Your; aṅghrayaḥ—lotus feet.
[Someone may say that aside from devotees, who always seek shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, there are those who are not devotees but who have accepted different processes for attaining salvation. What happens to them? In answer to this question, Lord Brahmā and the other demigods said:] O lotus-eyed Lord, although nondevotees who accept severe austerities and penances to achieve the highest position may think themselves liberated, their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because they have no regard for Your lotus feet.

tathā na te mādhava tāvakāḥ kvacid
bhraśyanti mārgāt tvayi baddha-sauhṛdāḥ
tvayābhiguptā vicaranti nirbhayā
vināyakānīkapa-mūrdhasu prabho
tathā—like them (the nondevotees); na—not; te—they (the devotees); mādhava—O Lord, husband of the goddess of fortune; tāvakāḥ—the followers of the devotional path, the devotees; kvacit—in any circumstances; bhraśyanti—fall down; mārgāt—from the path of devotional service; tvayi—unto You; baddha-sauhṛdāḥ—because of being fully attached to Your lotus feet; tvayā—by You; abhiguptāḥ—always protected from all dangers; vicaranti—they move; nirbhayāḥ—without fear; vināyaka-anīkapa—the enemies who maintain paraphernalia to oppose the bhakti cult; mūrdhasu—on their heads; prabho—O Lord.
O Mādhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.

sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ śrayate bhavān sthitau

tavārhaṇaṁ yena janaḥ samīhate
sattvam—existence; viśuddham—transcendental, beyond the three modes of material nature; śrayate—accepts; bhavān—Your Lordship; sthitau—during the maintenance of this material world; śarīriṇām—of all living entities; śreyaḥ—of supreme auspiciousness; upāyanam—for the benefit; vapuḥ—a transcendental form or body; veda-kriyā—by ritualistic ceremonies according to the directions of the Vedas; yoga—by practice of devotion; tapaḥ—by austerities; samādhibhiḥ—by becoming absorbed in transcendental existence; tava—Your; arhaṇam—worship; yena—by such activities; janaḥ—human society; samīhate—offers (its obligation unto You).
O Lord, during the time of maintenance You manifest several incarnations, all with transcendental bodies, beyond the material modes of nature. When You appear in this way, You bestow all good fortune upon the living entities by teaching them to perform Vedic activities such as ritualistic ceremonies, mystic yoga, austerities, penances, and ultimately samādhi, ecstatic absorption in thoughts of You. Thus You are worshiped by the Vedic principles.

sattvaṁ na ced dhātar idaṁ nijaṁ bhaved

O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.

O Lord, Your transcendental name and form are not ascertained by those who merely speculate on the path of imagination. Your name, form and attributes can be ascertained only through devotional service.

śṛṇvan gṛṇan saṁsmarayaṁś ca cintayan
nāmāni rūpāṇi ca maṅgalāni te
kriyāsu yas tvac-caraṇāravindayor
āviṣṭa-cetā na bhavāya kalpate

Even while engaged in various activities, devotees whose minds are completely absorbed at Your lotus feet, and who constantly hear, chant, contemplate and cause others to remember Your transcendental names and forms, are always on the transcendental platform, and thus they can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

diṣṭyā hare 'syā bhavataḥ pado bhuvo

O Lord, we are fortunate because the heavy burden of the demons upon this earth has been immediately removed by Your appearance. Indeed, we are certainly fortunate, for we shall be able to see upon this earth and in the heavenly planets the marks of lotus, conchshell, club and disc that adorn Your lotus feet.

na te 'bhavasyeśa bhavasya kāraṇaṁ
vinā vinodaṁ bata tarkayāmahe
bhavo nirodhaḥ sthitir apy avidyayā
kṛtā yatas tvayy abhayāśrayātmani

O Supreme Lord, You are not an ordinary living entity appearing in this material world as a result of fruitive activities. Therefore Your appearance or birth in this world has no other cause than Your pleasure potency. Similarly, the living entities, who are part of You, have no cause for miseries like birth, death and old age, except when these living entities are conducted by Your external energy.

Now please protect us again by Your mercy by diminishing the disturbances in this world. O Kṛṣṇa, best of the Yadus, we respectfully offer our obeisances unto You.

O Mother Devakī, by your good fortune and ours, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, with all His plenary portions, such as Baladeva, is now within your womb. Therefore you need not fear Kaṁsa, who has decided to be killed by the Lord. Your eternal son, Kṛṣṇa, will be the protector of the entire Yadu dynasty.
Song Prayers by Vasudeva to Krsna after His Apperance (SB 10.3.13-22)

Vasudeva said: My Lord, You are the Supreme Person, beyond material existence, and You are the Supersoul. Your form can be perceived by transcendental knowledge, by which You can be understood as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I now understand Your position perfectly.

My Lord, You are the same person who in the beginning created this material world by His personal external energy. After the creation of this world of three guṇas [sattva, rajas and tamas], You appear to have entered it, although in fact You have not.

grāhyair guṇaiḥ sann api tad-guṇāgrahaḥ
anāvṛtatvād bahir antaraṁ na te
sarvasya sarvātmana ātma-vastunaḥ
yathā—as; ime—these material creations, made of material energy; avikṛtāḥ—actually not unintegrated; bhāvāḥ—with such a conception; tathā—similarly; te—they; vikṛtaiḥ saha—association with these different elements coming from the total material energy; nānā-vīryāḥ—every element is full of different energies; pṛthak—separated; bhūtāḥ—becoming; virājam—the whole cosmic manifestation; janayanti—create; hi—indeed; sannipatya—because of association with the spiritual energy; samutpādya—after being created; dṛśyante—they appear; anugatāḥ—entered within it; iva—as if; prāk—from the very beginning, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation; eva—indeed; vidyamānatvāt—due to the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; na—not; teṣām—of these material elements; iha—in this matter of creation; sambhavaḥ—entering would have been possible; evam—in this way; bhavān—O my Lord; buddhi-anumeya-lakṣaṇaiḥ—by real intelligence and by such symptoms; grāhyaiḥ—with the objects of the senses; guṇaiḥ—with the modes of material nature; san api—although in touch; tat-guṇa-agrahaḥ—are not touched by the material qualities; anāvṛtatvāt—because of being situated everywhere; bahiḥ antaram—within the external and internal; na te—there is no such thing for You; sarvasya—of everything; sarva-ātmanaḥ—You are the root of everything; ātma-vastunaḥ—everything belongs to You, but You are outside and inside of everything.
The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [jīva-bhūta], these separated energies combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the mind or words [avāṅ-mānasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses. Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never entered the womb of Devakī; rather, You existed there already.

ya ātmano dṛśya-guṇeṣu sann iti
vyavasyate sva-vyatirekato 'budhaḥ
vinānuvādaṁ na ca tan manīṣitaṁ
samyag yatas tyaktam upādadat pumān
yaḥ—anyone who; ātmanaḥ—of his own real identity, the soul; dṛśya-guṇeṣu—among the visible objects, beginning with the body; san—being situated in that position; iti—thus; vyavasyate—continues to act; sva-vyatirekataḥ—as if the body were independent of the soul; abudhaḥ—a rascal; vinā anuvādam—without proper analytical study; na—not; ca—also; tat—the body and other visible objects; manīṣitam—such considerations having been discussed; samyak—fully; yataḥ—because he is a fool; tyaktam—are rejected; upādadat—accepts this body as reality; pumān—a person.
One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in the soul, the visible body and senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it a reality.

tvattaḥ—are from Your Lordship; asya—of the entire cosmic manifestation; janma—the creation; sthiti—maintenance; saṁyamān—and annihilation; vibho—O my Lord; vadanti—the learned Vedic scholars conclude; anīhāt—who are free from endeavor; aguṇāt—who are unaffected by the modes of material nature; avikriyāt—who are unchanging in Your spiritual situation; tvayi—in You; īśvare—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; brahmaṇi—who are Para-brahman, the Supreme Brahman; na u—not; virudhyate—there is a contradiction; tvat-āśrayatvāt—because of being controlled by You; upacaryate—things are going on automatically; guṇaiḥ—by the operation of the material modes.
O my Lord, learned Vedic scholars conclude that the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the entire cosmic manifestation are performed by You, who are free from endeavor, unaffected by the modes of material nature, and changeless in Your spiritual situation. There are no contradictions in You, who are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Para-brahman. Because the three modes of material nature-sattva, rajas and tamas—are under Your control, everything takes place automatically.

śrī-devaky uvāca
rūpaṁ yat tat prāhur avyaktam ādyaṁ
brahma jyotir nirguṇaṁ nirvikāram
sattā-mātraṁ nirviśeṣaṁ nirīhaṁ
sa tvaṁ sākṣād viṣṇur adhyātma-dīpaḥ
śrī-devakī uvāca—Śrī Devakī said; rūpam—form or substance; yat tat—because You are the same substance; prāhuḥ—You are sometimes called; avyaktam—not perceivable by the material senses (ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ); ādyam—You are the original cause; brahma—You are known as Brahman; jyotiḥ—light; nirguṇam—without material qualities; nirvikāram—without change, the same form of Viṣṇu perpetually; sattā-mātram—the original substance, the cause of everything; nirviśeṣam—You are present everywhere as the Supersoul (within the heart of a human being and within the heart of an animal, the same substance is present); nirīham—without material desires; saḥ—that Supreme Person; tvam—Your Lordship; sākṣāt—directly; viṣṇuḥ—Lord Viṣṇu; adhyātma-dīpaḥ—the light for all transcendental knowledge (knowing You, one knows everything: kasmin nu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavatīti).
Śrī Devakī said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Paramātmā, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Viṣṇu, the light of all transcendental knowledge.

After millions of years, at the time of cosmic annihilation, when everything, manifested and unmanifested, is annihilated by the force of time, the five gross elements enter into the subtle conception, and the manifested categories enter into the unmanifested substance. At that time, You alone remain, and You are known as Ananta Śeṣa-nāga.

Let me offer my full surrender unto Your Lordship.

tathā api—nevertheless; bhūman—O limitless one; mahimā—the potency; aguṇasya—of Him who has no material qualities; te—of You; viboddhum—to understand; arhati—one is able; amala—spotless; antaḥ-ātmabhiḥ—with mind and senses; avikriyāt—not based on material differentiations; sva-anubhavāt—by perception of the Supreme Soul; arūpataḥ—without attachment to material forms; hi—indeed; ananya-bodhya-ātmatayā—as self-manifested, without the help of any other illuminating agent; na—not; ca—and; anyathā—otherwise.
Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal feature. Nevertheless, it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.

guṇa-ātmanaḥ—of the possessor of all superior qualities; te—You; api—certainly; guṇān—the qualities; vimātum—to count; hita-avatīrṇasya—who have descended for the benefit of all living entities; ke—who; īśire—are able; asya—of the universe; kālena—in due course of time; yaiḥ—by whom; vā—or; vimitāḥ—counted; su-kalpaiḥ—by great scientists; bhū-pāṁśavaḥ—the atoms of an earthly planet; khe—in the sky; mihikāḥ—the particles of snow; dyu-bhāsaḥ—the illumination of stars and planets.
In time, learned philosophers or scientists might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the particles of snow, or perhaps even the shining molecules radiating from the sun, the stars and other luminaries. But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?

My dear Lord, one who earnestly waits for You to bestow Your causeless mercy upon him, all the while patiently suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds and offering You respectful obeisances with his heart, words and body, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.

My Lord, just see my uncivilized impudence! To test Your power I tried to extend my illusory potency to cover You, the unlimited and primeval Supersoul, who bewilder even the masters of illusion. What am I compared to You? I am just like a small spark in the presence of a great fire.

Therefore, O infallible Lord, kindly excuse my offenses. I have taken birth in the mode of passion and am therefore simply foolish, presuming myself a controller independent of Your Lordship. My eyes are blinded by the darkness of ignorance, which causes me to think of myself as the unborn creator of the universe. But please consider that I am Your servant and therefore worthy of Your compassion.

Unlimited universes pass through the pores of Your body just as particles of dust pass through the openings of a screened window.

My dear Lord, it is said that when the three planetary systems are merged into the water at the time of dissolution, Your plenary portion, Nārāyaṇa, lies down on the water, gradually a lotus flower grows from His navel, and Brahmā takes birth upon that lotus flower. Certainly, these words are not false. Thus am I not born from You?

Are You not the original Nārāyaṇa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Nārāyaṇa is Your expansion, and He is called Nārāyaṇa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Māyā.

My dear Lord, in this incarnation You have proved that You are the supreme controller of Māyā. Although You are now within this universe, the whole universal creation is within Your transcendental body—a fact You demonstrated by exhibiting the universe within Your abdomen before Your mother, Yaśodā.

Have You not shown me today that both You Yourself and everything within this creation are manifestations of Your inconceivable potency? First You appeared alone, and then You manifested Yourself as all of Vṛndāvana's calves and cowherd boys, Your friends. Next You appeared as an equal number of four-handed Viṣṇu forms, who were worshiped by all living beings, including me, and after that You appeared as an equal number of complete universes. Finally, You have now returned to Your unlimited form as the Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second.

Therefore this entire universe, which like a dream is by nature unreal, nevertheless appears real, and thus it covers one's consciousness and assails one with repeated miseries. This universe appears real because it is manifested by the potency of illusion emanating from You, whose unlimited transcendental forms are full of eternal happiness and knowledge.

The conception of material bondage and the conception of liberation are both manifestations of ignorance. Being outside the scope of true knowledge, they cease to exist when one correctly understands that the pure spirit soul is distinct from matter and always fully conscious. At that time bondage and liberation no longer have any significance, just as day and night have no significance from the perspective of the sun.

Such fools conclude that the supreme soul is to be searched for somewhere outside Your supreme personality.

Yet even though the extent of the good fortune of these residents of Vṛndāvana is inconceivable, we eleven presiding deities of the various senses, headed by Lord Śiva, are also most fortunate, because the senses of these devotees of Vṛndāvana are the cups through which we repeatedly drink the nectarean, intoxicating beverage of the honey of Your lotus feet.

My greatest possible good fortune would be to take any birth whatever in this forest of Gokula and have my head bathed by the dust falling from the lotus feet of any of its residents. Their entire life and soul is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, the dust of whose lotus feet is still being searched for in the Vedic mantras.

My mind becomes bewildered just trying to think of what reward other than You could be found anywhere. You are the embodiment of all benedictions, which You bestow upon these residents of the cowherd community of Vṛndāvana. You have already arranged to give Yourself to Pūtanā and her family members in exchange for her disguising herself as a devotee. So what is left for You to give these devotees of Vṛndāvana, whose homes, wealth, friends, dear relations, bodies, children and very lives and hearts are all dedicated only to You?

What You have done here is actually mercy for us, since the punishment You give to the wicked certainly drives away all their contamination. Indeed, because this conditioned soul, our husband, is so sinful that he has assumed the body of a serpent, Your anger toward him is obviously to be understood as Your mercy.

As these two sons enter the forest, surrounded by Their friends, driving the cows before Them, They hold Their flutes to Their mouths and glance lovingly upon the residents of Vṛndāvana. For those who have eyes, we think there is no greater object of vision.

His mother, the river on whose bank the bamboo was born, feels jubilation, and therefore her blooming lotus flowers are standing like hair on her body.

The gopīs said: O gopīs, when Mukunda vibrates the flute He has placed to His lips, stopping its holes with His tender fingers, He rests His left cheek on His left arm and makes His eyebrows dance. At that time the demigoddesses traveling in the sky with their husbands, the Siddhas, become amazed. As those ladies listen, they are embarrassed to find their minds yielding to the pursuit of lusty desires, and in their distress they are unaware that the belts of their garments are loosening.

Stunned, they appear as if asleep, or like figures in a painting.

My dear gopī, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balarāma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.

Kṛṣṇa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kṛṣṇa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viṣṇu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.

O goddesses of Vraja, when Kṛṣṇa is enjoying Himself with Balarāma on the mountain slopes, playfully wearing a flower garland on the top of His head, He engladdens all with the resonant vibrations of His flute. Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend Kṛṣṇa and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.

O pious Mother Yaśodā, your son, who is expert in all the arts of herding cows, has invented many new styles of flute-playing. When He takes His flute to His bimba-red lips and sends forth the tones of the harmonic scale in variegated melodies, Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and other chief demigods become confused upon hearing the sound. Although they are the most learned authorities, they cannot ascertain the essence of that music, and thus they bow down their heads and hearts.

As Kṛṣṇa strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gopīs, who become agitated by Cupid when Kṛṣṇa playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.

Now Kṛṣṇa is standing somewhere counting His cows on a string of gems. He wears a garland of tulasī flowers that bear the fragrance of His beloved, and He has thrown His arm over the shoulder of an affectionate cowherd boyfriend. As Kṛṣṇa plays His flute and sings, the music attracts the black deer's wives, who approach that ocean of transcendental qualities and sit down beside Him. Just like us cowherd girls, they have given up all hope for happiness in family life.

The gentle breeze honors Him with its soothing fragrance of sandalwood, while the various Upadevas, standing on all sides like panegyrists, offer their music, singing and gifts of tribute.

Out of great affection for the cows of Vraja, Kṛṣṇa became the lifter of Govardhana Hill. At the end of the day, having rounded up all His own cows, He plays a song on His flute, while exalted demigods standing along the path worship His lotus feet and the cowherd boys accompanying Him chant His glories. His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Kṛṣṇa is the moon arisen from the womb of Mother Yaśodā.

As Kṛṣṇa respectfully greets His well-wishing friends, His eyes roll slightly as if from intoxication. He wears a flower garland, and the beauty of His soft cheeks is accentuated by the brilliance of His golden earrings and the whiteness of His face, which has the color of a badara berry. With His cheerful face resembling the moon, lord of the night, the Lord of the Yadus moves with the grace of a regal elephant. Thus He returns in the evening, delivering the cows of Vraja from the heat of the day.

Then, O Lord of the universe, in Dvārakā You will deliver King Nṛga from a curse and take for Yourself the Syamantaka jewel, together with another wife. You will bring back a brāhmaṇa's dead son from the abode of Your servant Yamarāja, and thereafter You will kill Pauṇḍraka, burn down the city of Kāśī and slay Dantavakra, and You will also put an end to the king of Cedi during the great Rājasūya sacrifice. I shall see all these heroic pastimes, along with many others You will perform during Your residence in Dvārakā. These pastimes are glorified on this earth in the songs of transcendental poets.

sakṛt—once; adhara—of the lips; sudhām—the nectar; svām—His own; mohinīm—bewildering; pāyayitvā—making drink; sumanasaḥ—flowers; iva—like; sadyaḥ—suddenly; tatyaje—He abandoned; asmān—us; bhavādṛk—like you; paricarati—serves; katham—why; tat—His; pāda-padmam—lotus feet; nu—I wonder; padmā—Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune; hi api—indeed, because; bata—alas; hṛta—taken away; cetāḥ—her mind; hi—certainly; uttama-śloka—of Kṛṣṇa; jalpaiḥ—by the false speech.
After making us drink the enchanting nectar of His lips only once, Kṛṣṇa suddenly abandoned us, just as you might quickly abandon some flowers. How is it, then, that Goddess Padmā willingly serves His lotus feet? Alas! The answer must certainly be that her mind has been stolen away by His deceitful words.

kim—why; iha—here; bahu—much; ṣaṭ-aṅghre—O bee (six-footed one); gāyasi—are singing; tvam—you; yadūnām—of the Yadus; adhipatim—about the master; agṛhāṇām—who have no home; agrataḥ—in front of; naḥ—us; purāṇam—old; vijaya—of Arjuna; sakha—of the friend; sakhīnām—for the friends; gīyatām—should be sung; tat—of Him; prasaṅgaḥ—the topics; kṣapita—relieved; kuca—of whose breasts; rujaḥ—the pain; te—they; kalpayanti—will provide; iṣṭam—the charity you desire; iṣṭāḥ—His beloveds.
O bee, why do you sing here so much about the Lord of the Yadus, in front of us homeless people? These topics are old news to us. Better you sing about that friend of Arjuna in front of His new girlfriends, the burning desire in whose breasts He has now relieved. Those ladies will surely give you the charity you are begging.

In heaven, on earth or in the subterranean sphere, what women are unavailable to Him? He simply arches His eyebrows and smiles with deceptive charm, and they all become His. The supreme goddess herself worships the dust of His feet, so what is our position in comparison? But at least those who are wretched can chant His name, Uttamaśloka.

Keep your head off My feet! I know what you're doing. You expertly learned diplomacy from Mukunda, and now you come as His messenger with flattering words. But He abandoned those who for His sake alone gave up their children, husbands and all other relations. He's simply ungrateful. Why should I make up with Him now?

mṛgayuḥ—a hunter; iva—like; kapi—of the monkeys; indram—the king; vivyadhe—shot; lubdha-dharmā—behaving like a cruel hunter; striyam—a woman (namely, Śūrpaṇakhā); akṛta—made; virūpām—disfigured; strī—by a woman (Sītā-devī); jitaḥ—conquered; kāmayānām—who was impelled by lusty desire; balim—King Bali; api—also; balim—his tribute; attvā—consuming; aveṣṭayat—bound up; dhvāṅkṣavat—just like a crow; yaḥ—who; tat—therefore; alam—enough; asita—with black Kṛṣṇa; sakhyaiḥ—of all kinds of friendship; dustyajaḥ—impossible to give up; tat—about Him; kathā—of the topics; arthaḥ—the elaboration.
Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mahārāja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can't give up talking about Him.

To hear about the pastimes that Kṛṣṇa regularly performs is nectar for the ears. For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to Vṛndāvana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.

Faithfully taking His deceitful words as true, we became just like the black deer's foolish wives, who trust the cruel hunter's song. Thus we repeatedly felt the sharp pain of lust caused by the touch of His nails. O messenger, please talk about something besides Kṛṣṇa.

O Uddhava! It is indeed regrettable that Kṛṣṇa resides in Mathurā. Does He remember His father's household affairs and His friends, the cowherd boys? O great soul! Does He ever talk about us, His maidservants? When will He lay on our heads His aguru-scented hand?

etāḥ—these women; param—alone; tanu—their bodies; bhṛtaḥ—maintain successfully; bhuvi—on the earth; gopa-vadhvaḥ—the young cowherd women; govinde—for Lord Kṛṣṇa; eva—exclusively; nikhila—of all; ātmani—the Soul; rūḍha—perfected; bhāvāḥ—ecstatic loving attraction; vāñchanti—they desire; yat—which; bhava—material existence; bhiyaḥ—those who are afraid of; munayaḥ—sages; vayam—we; ca—also; kim—what use; brahma—as a brāhmaṇa or as Lord Brahmā; janmabhiḥ—with births; ananta—of the unlimited Lord; kathā—for the topics; rasasya—for one who has a taste.
[Uddhava sang:] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brāhmaṇa, or even as Lord Brahmā himself?

kva—where, in comparison; imāḥ—these; striyaḥ—women; vana—in the forests; carīḥ—who wander; vyabhicāra—by improper behavior; duṣṭāḥ—contaminated; kṛṣṇe—for Kṛṣṇa; kva ca—and where; eṣaḥ—this; parama-ātmani—for the Supreme Soul; rūḍha-bhāvaḥ—stage of perfect love (known technically as mahā-bhāva); nanu—certainly; īśvaraḥ—the Personality of Godhead; anubhajataḥ—to one who constantly worships Him; aviduṣaḥ—not learned; api—even though; sākṣāt—directly; śreyaḥ—the highest good; tanoti—bestows; agada—of medicines; rājaḥ—the king (namely, the nectar which the demigods drink for long life); iva—as if; upayuktaḥ—taken.
How amazing it is that these simple women who wander about the forest, seemingly spoiled by improper behavior, have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul! Still, it is true that the Supreme Lord Himself awards His blessings even to an ignorant worshiper, just as the best medicine works even when taken by a person ignorant of its ingredients.

When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced by the arms of the Lord. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Indeed, never was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the beauty and fragrance of a lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to material estimation?

The gopīs of Vṛndāvana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to become one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vṛndāvana, because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.

The goddess of fortune herself, along with Lord Brahmā and all the other demigods, who are masters of yogic perfection, can worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa only within her mind. But during the rāsa dance Lord Kṛṣṇa placed His feet upon these gopīs' breasts, and by embracing those feet the gopīs gave up all distress.

Since it has never been demonstrated that You are covered by material, bodily designations, it must be concluded that for You there is neither birth in a literal sense nor any duality. Therefore You never undergo bondage or liberation, and if You appear to, it is only because of Your desire that we see You in that way, or simply because of our lack of discrimination.

Since I will be staying within the inner chambers of the palace, You may wonder, "How can I carry you away without killing some of your relatives?" But I shall tell You a way: On the day before the marriage there is a grand procession to honor the royal family's deity, and in this procession the new bride goes outside the city to visit Goddess Girijā.

O lotus-eyed one, great souls like Lord Śiva hanker to bathe in the dust of Your lotus feet and thereby destroy their ignorance. If I cannot obtain Your mercy, I shall simply give up my vital force, which will have become weak from the severe penances I will perform. Then, after hundreds of lifetimes of endeavor, I may obtain Your mercy.

Desiring to create, O unborn master, You increase and then assume the mode of passion. You do likewise with the mode of ignorance when You wish to annihilate the universe and with goodness when You wish to maintain it. Nonetheless, You remain uncovered by these modes. You are time, the pradhāna, and the puruṣa, O Lord of the universe, yet still You are separate and distinct.

Śrī Rukmiṇī said: Actually, what You have said is true, O lotus-eyed one. I am indeed unsuitable for the almighty Personality of Godhead. What comparison is there between that Supreme Lord, who is master of the three primal deities and who delights in His own glory, and myself, a woman of mundane qualities whose feet are grasped by fools?

Yes, my Lord Urukrama, You lay down within the ocean as if afraid of the material modes, and thus in pure consciousness You appear within the heart as the Supersoul. You are always battling against the foolish material senses, and indeed even Your servants reject the privilege of royal dominion, which leads to the blindness of ignorance.

You possess nothing because there is nothing beyond You. Even the great enjoyers of tribute—Brahmā and other demigods—pay tribute to You. Those who are blinded by their wealth and absorbed in gratifying their senses do not recognize You in the form of death. But to the gods, the enjoyers of tribute, You are the most dear, as they are to You.

You are the embodiment of all human goals and are Yourself the final aim of life. Desiring to attain You, O all-powerful Lord, intelligent persons abandon everything else. It is they who are worthy of Your association, not men and women absorbed in the pleasure and grief resulting from their mutual lust.

Knowing that great sages who have renounced the sannyāsī's daṇḍa proclaim Your glories, that You are the Supreme Soul of all the worlds, and that You are so gracious that You give away even Your own self, I chose You as my husband, rejecting Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the rulers of heaven, whose aspirations are all frustrated by the force of time, which is born from Your eyebrows. What interest, then, could I have in any other suitors?

My Lord, as a lion drives away lesser animals to claim his proper tribute, You drove off the assembled kings with the resounding twang of Your Śārṅga bow and then claimed me, Your fair share. Thus it is sheer foolishness, my dear Gadāgraja, for You to say You took shelter in the ocean out of fear of those kings.

Since You are the abode of transcendental qualities, what mortal woman with the insight to distinguish her own true interest would disregard that fragrance and depend instead on someone who is always subject to terrible fear?

We arrogantly disregarded You, O Lord, who stood before us as death. But now, O Kṛṣṇa, that powerful form of Yours called time, moving mysteriously and irresistibly, has deprived us of our opulences. Now that You have mercifully destroyed our pride, we beg simply to remember Your lotus feet.

Nor, O almighty Lord, will we hanker to enjoy the heavenly fruits of pious work in the next life, since the promise of such rewards is simply an empty enticement for the ears.

Effortlessly, He alone sends forth from His Self this variegated creation, maintains it and then swallows it up again, all without becoming entangled, just as the element earth takes on many names and forms in its various transformations.

A sleeping person imagines an alternative reality for himself and, seeing himself as having various names and forms, forgets his waking identity, which is distinct from the dream. Similarly, the senses of one whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceive only the names and forms of material objects. Thus such a person loses his memory and cannot know You.

But only those who render You wholehearted devotional service and in this way vanquish the soul's covering—the material mind—attain You as their final destination. Therefore kindly show mercy to us, Your devotees.

Thus everything active in the material world is set into motion by the Supreme Lord.

After manifesting each of these transcendental bodies to protect Your own principles of religion, You then made them unmanifest, thus appearing and disappearing like a cloud. O supremely glorified, all-pervading Lord, who can understand the mystic, deluding potency of Your opulent expansions?

bṛhat—as the Supreme; upalabdham—perceived; etat—this (world); avayanti—they consider; avaśeṣatayā—in terms of its being the all-pervading foundation of existence; yataḥ—since; udaya—the generation; astamayau—and dissolution; vikṛteḥ—of a transformation; mṛdi—of clay; vā—as if; avikṛtāt—(the Supreme itself) not being subject to transformation; ataḥ—therefore; ṛṣayaḥ—the sages (who compiled the Vedic mantras); dadhuḥ—placed; tvayi—in You; manaḥ—their minds; vacana—words; ācaritam—and actions; katham—how; ayathā—not as they are; bhavanti—become; bhuvi—upon the ground; datta—placed; padāni—the steps; nṛṇām—of men.
This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence, remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all, how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?

kim uta punaḥ sva-dhāma-vidhutāśaya-kāla-guṇāḥ
parama bhajanti ye padam ajasra-sukhānubhavam
iti—thus; tava—Your; sūrayaḥ—wise saints; tri—of the three (planetary systems of the universe, or the three modes of nature); adhipate—O master; akhila—of all; loka—the worlds; mala—the contamination; kṣapaṇa—which eradicates; kathā—of discussions; amṛta—nectar; abdhim—into the ocean; avagāhya—by diving deeply; tapāṁsi—their troubles; jahuḥ—have given up; kim uta—what to speak; punaḥ—moreover; sva—their own; dhāma—by the power; vidhuta—dispelled; āśaya—of their minds; kāla—and of time; guṇāḥ—the (undesirable) qualities; parama—O supreme one; bhajanti—worship; ye—who; padam—Your true nature; ajasra—uninterrupted; sukha—of happiness; anubhavam—(in which there is) experience.
Therefore, O master of the three worlds, the wise get rid of all misery by diving deep into the nectarean ocean of topics about You, which washes away all the contamination of the universe. Then what to speak of those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature, O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?

dṛtayaḥ—bellows; iva—as if; śvasanti—they breathe; asu-bhṛtaḥ—alive; yadi—if; te—Your; anuvidhāḥ—faithful followers; mahat—the total material energy; aham—false ego; ādayaḥ—and the other elements of creation; aṇḍam—the universal egg; asṛjan—produced; yat—whose; anugrahataḥ—by the mercy; puruṣa—of the living entity; vidhaḥ—according to the particular forms; anvayaḥ—whose entrance; atra—among these; caramaḥ—the ultimate; anna-maya-ādiṣu—among the manifestations known as anna-maya and so on; yaḥ—who; sat-asataḥ—from gross and subtle matter; param—distinct; tvam—You; atha—and furthermore; yat—which; eṣu—among these; avaśeṣam—underlying; ṛtam—the reality.
Only if they become Your faithful followers are those who breathe actually alive; otherwise their breathing is like that of a bellows. It is by Your mercy alone that the elements, beginning with the mahat-tattva and false ego, created the egg of this universe. Among the manifestations known as anna-maya and so forth, You are the ultimate one, entering within the material coverings along with the living entity and assuming the same forms as those he takes. Distinct from the gross and subtle material manifestations, You are the reality underlying them all.

udaram—the abdomen; upāsate—worship; ye—who; ṛṣi—of sages; vartmasu—according to the standard methods; kūrpa—gross; dṛśaḥ—their vision; parisara—from which all the prāṇic channels emanate; paddhatim—the node; hṛdayam—the heart; āruṇayaḥ—the Āruṇi sages; daharam—subtle; tataḥ—thence; udagāt—(the soul) rises up; ananta—O unlimited Lord; tava—Your; dhāma—place of appearance; śiraḥ—to the head; paramam—the highest destination; punaḥ—again; iha—into this world; yat—which; sametya—reaching; na patanti—they do not fall down; kṛta-anta—of death; mukhe—into the mouth.
Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of the abdomen, while the Āruṇis worship Him as present in the heart, in the subtle center from which all the prāṇic channels emanate. From there, O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then, passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world, into the mouth of death.

sva—by Yourself; kṛta—created; vicitra—variegated; yoniṣu—within the species of life; viśan—entering; iva—apparently; hetutayā—as their motivation; taratamataḥ—according to hierarchies; cakāssi—You become visible; anala-vat—like fire; sva—Your own; kṛta—creation; anukṛtiḥ—imitating; atha—therefore; vitathāsu—unreal; amūṣu—among these (various species); avitatham—not unreal; tava—Your; dhāma—manifestation; samam—undifferentiated; viraja—spotless; dhiyaḥ—whose minds; anuyanti—understand; abhivipaṇyavaḥ—those who are free from all material entanglements (paṇa); eka-rasam—unchanging.
Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among all these impermanent life forms.

sva—by himself; kṛta—created; pureṣu—in the bodies; amīṣu—these; abahiḥ—not externally; antara—or internally; saṁvaraṇam—whose factual envelopment; tava—Your; puruṣam—living entity; vadanti—(the Vedas) say; akhila—of all; śakti—energies; dhṛtaḥ—of the possessor; aṁśa—as the expansion; kṛtam—manifested; iti—in this manner; nṛ—of the living entity; gatim—the status; vivicya—ascertaining; kavayaḥ—learned sages; nigama—of the Vedas; āvapanam—the field in which all offerings are sown; bhavataḥ—Your; upāsate—they worship; aṅghrim—the feet; abhavam—which cause the cessation of material existence; bhuvi—on the earth; viśvasitāḥ—having developed faith.
The individual living entity, while inhabiting the material bodies he has created for himself by his karma, actually remains uncovered by either gross or subtle matter. This is so because, as the Vedas describe, he is part and parcel of You, the possessor of all potencies. Having determined this to be the status of the living entity, learned sages become imbued with faith and worship Your lotus feet, to which all Vedic sacrifices in this world are offered, and which are the source of liberation.

duravagama—difficult to understand; ātma—of the self; tattva—the truth; nigamāya—in order to propagate; tava—of You; ātta—who have assumed; tanoḥ—Your personal forms; carita—of the pastimes; mahā—vast; amṛta—of nectar; abdhi—in the ocean; parivarta—by diving; pariśramaṇāḥ—who have been relieved of fatigue; na parilaṣanti—do not wish for; kecit—a few persons; apavargam—liberation; api—even; īśvara—O Lord; te—Your; caraṇa—at the feet; saroja—lotus; haṁsa—of swans; kula—with the community; saṅga—because of association; visṛṣṭa—abandoned; gṛhāḥ—whose homes.
My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet.

tvat—You; anupatham—useful for serving; kulāyam—body; idam—this; ātma—self; suhṛt—friend; priya—and beloved; vat—as; carati—acts; tathā—nevertheless; unmukhe—who are favorably disposed; tvayi—in You; hite—who are helpful; priye—who are affectionate; ātmani—who are their very Self; ca—and; na—not; bata—alas; ramanti—they take pleasure; aho—ah; asat—of the unreal; upāsanayā—by worship; ātma—themselves; hanaḥ—killing; yat—in which (worship of the unreal); anuśayāḥ—whose persistent desires; bhramanti—they wander; uru—greatly; bhaye—in the fearful (material existence); ku—degraded; śarīra—bodies; bhṛtaḥ—carrying.
When this human body is used for Your devotional service, it acts as one's self, friend and beloved. But unfortunately, although You always show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.

Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we śrutis, who generally see You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts in the same way.

kaḥ—who; iha—in this world; nu—indeed; veda—knows; bata—ah; avara—recent; janma—whose birth; layaḥ—and annihilation; agra-saram—who came first; yataḥ—from whom; udagāt—arose; ṛṣiḥ—the learned sage, Brahmā; yam anu—following whom (Brahmā); deva-gaṇāḥ—the groups of demigods; ubhaye—both (those who control the senses and those who live in the regions above the heavenly planets); tarhi—at that time; na—no; sat—gross matter; na—no; ca—also; asat—subtle matter; ubhayam—that which is comprised of both (namely, the material bodies); na ca—nor; kāla—of time; javaḥ—the flow; kim api na—none at all; tatra—there; śāstram—authoritative scripture; avakṛṣya—withdrawing; śayīta—(the Supreme Lord) lies down; yadā—when.
Everyone in this world has recently been born and will soon die. So how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahmā, and all subsequent demigods, both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything within Himself, nothing else remains—no gross or subtle matter or bodies composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.

janim—creation; asataḥ—of the manifest world (from atoms); sataḥ—of that which is eternal; mṛtim—destruction; uta—also; ātmani—in the soul; ye—who; ca—and; bhidām—duality; vipaṇam—mundane business; ṛtam—real; smaranti—declare authoritatively; upadiśanti—teach; te—they; ārupitaiḥ—in terms of illusions imposed on reality; tri—three; guṇa—of the material modes; mayaḥ—composed; pumān—the living entity; iti—thus; bhidā—dualistic conception; yat—which; abodha—by ignorance; kṛtā—created; tvayi—in You; na—not; tataḥ—to such; paratra—transcendental; saḥ—that (ignorance); bhavet—can exist; avabodha—total consciousness; rase—whose composition.
Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed, that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter, or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always enjoy perfect, total awareness.

sat—real; iva—as if; manaḥ—the mind (and its manifestations); tri-vṛt—threefold (by the modes of material nature); tvayi—in You; vibhāti—appears; asat—unreal; ā-manujāt—extending to the human beings; sat—as real; abhimṛśanti—they consider; aśeṣam—entire; idam—this (world); ātmatayā—as nondifferent from the Self; ātma-vidaḥ—the knowers of the Self; na—not; hi—indeed; vikṛtim—the transformations; tyajanti—reject; kanakasya—of gold; tat-ātmatayā—inasmuch as they are nondifferent from it; sva—by Himself; kṛtam—created; anupraviṣṭam—and entered; idam—this; ātmatayā—as nondifferent from Himself; avasitam—ascertained.
The three modes of material nature comprise everything in this world—from the simplest phenomena to the complex human body. Although these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still, those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord who created it and then entered within it.

tava—You; pari ye caranti—who worship; akhila—of all; sattva—created entities; niketatayā—as the shelter; te—they; uta—simply; padā—with their feet; ākramanti—step upon; avigaṇayya—disregarding; śiraḥ—the head; nirṛteḥ—of Death; parivayase—You tie up; paśūn iva—like animals; girā—with Your words (of the Vedas); vibudhān—wise; api—even; tān—them; tvayi—to whom; kṛta—those who have made; sauhṛdāḥ—friendship; khalu—indeed; punanti—purify; na—not; ye—who; vimukhāḥ—inimical.
The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves and others, not those who are inimical to You.

tvam—You; akaraṇaḥ—devoid of material senses; sva-rāṭ—self-effulgent; akhila—of all; kāraka—sensory functions; śakti—of the potencies; dharaḥ—the maintainer; tava—Your; balim—tribute; udvahanti—carry; samadanti—and partake of; ajayā—along with material nature; animiṣāḥ—the demigods; varṣa—of districts of a kingdom; bhujaḥ—the rulers; akhila—entire; kṣiti—of the land; pateḥ—of the lord; iva—as if; viśva—of the universe; sṛjaḥ—the creators; vidadhati—execute; yatra—in which; ye—they; tu—indeed; adhikṛtā—assigned; bhavataḥ—of You; cakitāḥ—afraid.
Though You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent sustainer of everyone's sensory powers. The demigods and material nature herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land, while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services out of fear of You.

sthira—stationary; cara—and moving; jātayaḥ—species of life; syuḥ—become manifest; ajayā—with the material energy; uttha—awakened; nimitta—their motivations for activity (and the subtle bodies activated by such); yujaḥ—assuming; viharaḥ—sport; udīkṣayā—by Your brief glance; yadi—if; parasya—of Him who is aloof; vimukta—O eternally liberated one; tataḥ—from her; na—not; hi—indeed; paramasya—for the supreme; kaścit—anyone; aparaḥ—not foreign; na—nor; paraḥ—foreign; ca—also; bhavet—can be; viyataḥ—for the ethereal sky; iva—as if; apadasya—which has no perceptible qualities; tava—for You; śūnya—to a void; tulām—a resemblance; dadhataḥ—who take on.
O eternally liberated, transcendental Lord, Your material energy causes the various moving and nonmoving species of life to appear by activating their material desires, but only when and if You sport with her by briefly glancing at her. You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, see no one as an intimate friend and no one as a stranger, just as the ethereal sky has no connection with perceptible qualities. In this sense You resemble a void.

If the countless living entities were all-pervading and possessed forms that never changed, You could not possibly be their absolute ruler, O immutable one. But since they are Your localized expansions and their forms are subject to change, You do control them. Indeed, that which supplies the ingredients for the generation of something is necessarily its controller because a product never exists apart from its ingredient cause. It is simply illusion for someone to think that he knows the Supreme Lord, who is equally present in each of His expansions, since whatever knowledge one gains by material means must be imperfect.

na ghaṭate—does not happen; udbhavaḥ—the generation; prakṛti—of material nature; pūruṣayoḥ—and of the soul who is her enjoyer; ajayoḥ—who are unborn; ubhaya—of both; yujā—by the combination; bhavanti—come into being; asu-bhṛtaḥ—living bodies; jala—on water; budbuda—bubbles; vat—like; tvayi—in You; te ime—these (living beings); tataḥ—therefore; vividha—various; nāma—with names; guṇaiḥ—and qualities; parame—in the Supreme; saritaḥ—rivers; iva—as; arṇave—within the ocean; madhuni—in honey; lilyuḥ—become merged; aśeṣa—all; rasāḥ—flavors.
Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey, so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.

The wise souls who understand how Your Māyā deludes all human beings render potent loving service to You, who are the source of liberation from birth and death. How, indeed, can fear of material life affect Your faithful servants? On the other hand, Your furrowing eyebrows—the triple-rimmed wheel of time—repeatedly terrify those who refuse to take shelter of You.

The mind is like an impetuous horse that even persons who have regulated their senses and breath cannot control. Those in this world who try to tame the uncontrolled mind, but who abandon the feet of their spiritual master, encounter hundreds of obstacles in their cultivation of various distressful practices. O unborn Lord, they are like merchants on a boat in the ocean who have failed to employ a helmsman.

To those persons who take shelter of You, You reveal Yourself as the Supersoul, the embodiment of all transcendental pleasure. What further use have such devotees for their servants, children or bodies, their wives, money or houses, their land, good health or conveyances? And for those who fail to appreciate the truth about You and go on pursuing the pleasures of sex, what could there be in this entire world—a place inherently doomed to destruction and devoid of significance—that could give them real happiness?

bhuvi—on the earth; puru—greatly; puṇya—pious; tīrtha—places of pilgrimage; sadanāni—and personal abodes of the Supreme Lord; ṛṣayaḥ—sages; vimadaḥ—free from false pride; te—they; uta—indeed; bhavat—Your; pada—feet; ambuja—lotus; hṛdaḥ—in whose hearts; agha—sins; bhit—which destroys; aṅghri—(having bathed) whose feet; jalāḥ—the water; dadhati—turn; sakṛt—even once; manaḥ—their minds; tvayi—toward You; ye—who; ātmani—toward the Supreme Soul; nitya—always; sukhe—who is happy; na punaḥ—never again; upāsate—they worship; puruṣa—of a man; sāra—the essential qualities; hara—which steal away; āvasathān—their mundane homes.
Sages free from false pride live on this earth by frequenting the sacred pilgrimage sites and those places where the Supreme Lord displayed His pastimes. Because such devotees keep Your lotus feet within their hearts, the water that washes their feet destroys all sins. Anyone who even once turns his mind toward You, the ever-blissful Soul of all existence, no longer dedicates himself to serving family life at home, which simply robs a man of his good qualities.

sata idaṁ utthitaṁ sad iti cen nanu tarka-hataṁ
vyabhicarati kva ca kva ca mṛṣā na tathobhaya-yuk
vyavahṛtaye vikalpa iṣito 'ndha-paramparayā
bhramayati bhāratī ta uru-vṛttibhir uktha-jaḍān
sataḥ—from that which is permanent; idam—this (universe); utthitam—arisen; sat—permanent; iti—thus; cet—if (someone proposes); nanu—certainly; tarka—by logical contradiction; hatam—refuted; vyabhicarati—it is inconsistent; kva ca—in some cases; kva ca—in other cases; mṛṣā—illusion; na—not; tathā—so; ubhaya—of both (the real and illusion); yuk—the conjunction; vyavahṛtaye—for the sake of ordinary affairs; vikalpaḥ—an imaginary situation; iṣitaḥ—desired; andha—of blind men; paramparayā—by a succession; bhramayati—bewilder; bhāratī—the words of wisdom; te—Your; uru—numerous; vṛttibhiḥ—with their semantic functions; uktha—by ritual utterances; jaḍān—dulled.
It may be proposed that this world is permanently real because it is generated from the permanent reality, but such an argument is subject to logical refutation. Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their material affairs. With their various meanings and implications, the learned words of Your Vedas bewilder all persons whose minds have been dulled by hearing the incantations of sacrificial rituals.

na yad idam agra āsa na bhaviṣyad ato nidhanād
anu mitam antarā tvayi vibhāti mṛṣaika-rase
ata upamīyate draviṇa-jāti-vikalpa-pathair
vitatha-mano-vilāsam ṛtam ity avayanty abudhāḥ
na—not; yat—because; idam—this (universe); agre—in the beginning; āsa—existed; na bhaviṣyat—it will not exist; ataḥ—hence; nidhanāt anu—after its annihilation; mitam—deduced; antarā—in the meantime; tvayi—within You; vibhāti—it appears; mṛṣā—false; ekarase—whose experience of spiritual ecstasy is unchanging; ataḥ—thus; upamīyate—it is understood by comparison; draviṇa—of material substance; jāti—in the categories; vikalpa—of the transformations; pathaiḥ—with the varieties; vitatha—contrary to fact; manaḥ—of the mind; vilāsam—fantasy; ṛtam—real; iti—so; avayanti—think; abudhaḥ—the unintelligent.
Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe to the transformation of various material substances into diverse forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination is substantially real are less intelligent.

mahasi mahīyase 'ṣṭa-guṇite 'parimeya-bhagaḥ
saḥ—he (the individual living entity); yat—because; ajayā—by the influence of the material energy; tu—but; ajām—that material energy; anuśayīta—lies down next to; guṇān—her qualities; ca—and; juṣan—assuming; bhajati—he takes on; sa-rūpatām—forms resembling (the qualities of nature); tat-anu—following that; mṛtyum—death; apeta—deprived; bhagaḥ—of his assets; tvam—You; uta—on the other hand; jahāsi—leave aside; tām—her (the material energy); ahiḥ—a snake; iva—as if; tvacam—its (old, discarded) skin; ātta-bhagaḥ—endowed with all assets; mahasi—in Your spiritual powers; mahīyase—You are glorified; aṣṭa-guṇite—eightfold; aparimeya—unlimited; bhagaḥ—whose greatness.
The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.

yadi—if; na samuddharanti—they do not uproot; yatayaḥ—persons in the renounced order of life; hṛdi—in their hearts; kāma—of material desire; jaṭāḥ—the traces; duradhigamaḥ—impossible to be realized; asatām—for the impure; hṛdi—in the heart; gataḥ—having entered; asmṛta—forgotten; kaṇṭha—on one's neck; maṇiḥ—a jewel; asu—their life airs; tṛpa—who gratify; yoginām—for practitioners of yoga; ubhayataḥ—in both (worlds); api—even; asukham—unhappiness; bhagavan—O Personality of Godhead; anapagata—not gone away; antakāt—from death; anadhirūḍha—unobtained; padāt—whose kingdom; bhavataḥ—from You.
Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts, for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a man who has totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who practice yoga only for sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next: from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they cannot reach.

tvat—You; avagamī—one who understands; na vetti—does not pay regard; bhavat—from You; uttha—rising; śubha-aśubhayoḥ—of the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness; guṇa-viguṇa—of good and bad; anvayān—to the attributions; tarhi—consequently; deha-bhṛtām—of embodied living beings; ca—also; giraḥ—the words; anu-yugam—in every age; anu-aham—every day; sa-guṇa—O You who are endowed with qualities; gīta—of recitation; paramparayā—by the chain of succession; śravaṇa—through hearing; bhṛtaḥ—carried; yataḥ—because of this; tvam—You; apavarga—of liberation; gatiḥ—the ultimate goal; manujaiḥ—by human beings, descendants of Manu.
When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu's descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation.

dyu—of heaven; patayaḥ—the masters; eva—even; te—Your; na yayuḥ—cannot reach; antam—the end; anantatayā—because of being unlimited; tvam—You; api—even; yat—whom; antara—within; aṇḍa—of universes; nicayāḥ—multitudes; nanu—indeed; sa—along with; āvaranāḥ—their outer shells; khe—in the sky; iva—as; rajāṁsi—particles of dust; vānti—blow about; vayasā saha—with the wheel of time; yat—because; śrutayaḥ—the Vedas; tvayi—in You; hi—indeed; phalanti—bear fruit; atat—of that which is distinct from the Absolute Truth; nirasanena—by the elimination; bhavat—in You; nidhanāḥ—whose ultimate conclusion.
Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion.

tīrtham—sacred place of pilgrimage; cakre—made; nṛpa—O King (Parīkṣit); ūnam—lesser; yat—which (glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa); ajani—He took birth; yaduṣu—among the Yadus; svaḥ—of heaven; sarit—the river; pāda—whose feet; śaucam—(the water) which washes; vidviṭ—enemies; snigdhāḥ—and loved ones; svarūpam—whose personal form; yayuḥ—attained; ajita—who is undefeated; parā—and supremely perfect; śrīḥ—the goddess of fortune; yat—whose; arthe—for the sake; anya—of others; yatnaḥ—endeavor; yat—whose; nāma—name; amaṅgala—inauspiciousness; ghnam—which destroys; śrutam—heard; atha—or else; gaditam—chanted; yat—by whom; kṛtaḥ—created; gotra—among the lines of descent (of various sages); dharmaḥ—the religious principles; kṛṣṇasya—for Lord Kṛṣṇa; etat—this; na—not; citram—wonderful; kṣiti—the earth's; bhara—of the burden; haraṇam—the removal; kāla—of time; cakra—the wheel; āyudhasya—whose weapon.
The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord Kṛṣṇa's feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated Kṛṣṇa and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?

jayati—eternally lives gloriously; jana-nivāsaḥ—He who lives among human beings like the members of the Yadu dynasty and is the ultimate resort of all living entities; devakī-janma-vādaḥ—known as the son of Devakī (No one can actually become the father or mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore devakī-janma-vada means that He is known as the son of Devakī. Similarly, He is also known as the son of Mother Yaśodā, Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja.); yadu-vara-pariṣat—served by the members of the Yadu dynasty or the cowherd men of Vṛndāvana (all of whom are constant associates of the Supreme Lord and are the Lord's eternal servants); svaiḥ dorbhiḥ—by His own arms, or by His devotees like Arjuna who are just like His own arms; asyan—killing; adharmam—demons or the impious; sthira-cara-vṛjina-ghnaḥ—the destroyer of all the ill fortune of all living entities, moving and not moving; su-smita—always smiling; śrī-mukhena—by His beautiful face; vraja-pura-vanitānām—of the damsels of Vṛndāvana; vardhayan—increasing; kāma-devam—the lusty desires.
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is He who is known as jana-nivāsa, the ultimate resort of all living entities, and who is also known as Devakīnandana or Yaśodā-nandana, the son of Devakī and Yaśodā. He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious. By His presence He destroys all things inauspicious for all living entities, moving and inert. His blissful smiling face always increases the lusty desires of the gopīs of Vṛndāvana. May He be all glorious and happy!

To protect the principles of devotional service to Himself, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the best of the Yadus, accepts the pastime forms that have been glorified here in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. One who desires to faithfully serve His lotus feet should hear of the activities He performs in each of these incarnations—activities that suitably imitate those of the forms He assumes. Hearing narrations of these pastimes destroys the reactions to fruitive work.

By regularly hearing, chanting and meditating on the beautiful topics of Lord Mukunda with ever-increasing sincerity, a mortal being will attain the divine kingdom of the Lord, where the inviolable power of death holds no sway. For this purpose, many persons, including great kings, abandoned their mundane homes and took to the forest.

The demigods place many obstacles on the path of those who worship You to transcend the temporary abodes of the demigods and reach Your supreme abode. Those who offer the demigods their assigned shares in sacrificial performances encounter no such obstacles. But because You are the direct protector of Your devotee, he is able to step over the head of whatever obstacle the demigods place before him.

Some men practice severe penances to cross beyond our influence, which is like an immeasurable ocean with endless waves of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and the other conditions brought about by the passing of time, such as the sensuous wind and the urges of the tongue and sex organs. Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.

O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain and devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent of māyā, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never affected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal spiritual bliss, and thus You cannot be accused of any material infection.

Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. May Your lotus feet become the blazing fire that burns to ashes all our inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.

O almighty Lord, You are so kind to Your servants that You have accepted the withered flower garland that we have placed on Your chest. Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lakṣmī and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.

O omnipotent Lord, in Your incarnation as Trivikrama, You raised Your leg like a flagpole to break the shell of the universe, allowing the holy Ganges to flow down, like a banner of victory, in three branches throughout the three planetary systems. By three mighty steps of Your lotus feet, Your Lordship captured Bali Mahārāja, along with his universal kingdom. Your lotus feet inspire fear in the demons by driving them down to hell and fearlessness among Your devotees by elevating them to the perfection of heavenly life. We are sincerely trying to worship You, our Lord; therefore may Your lotus feet kindly free us from all of our sinful reactions.

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the transcendental entity who is superior to both material nature and the enjoyer of nature. May Your lotus feet bestow transcendental pleasure upon us. All of the great demigods, beginning with Brahmā, are embodied living entities. Struggling painfully with one another under the strict control of Your time factor, they are just like bulls dragged by ropes tied through their pierced noses.

On the other hand, other living entities, even yogīs and philosophers, are disturbed and frightened simply by remembering the material objects that they have supposedly renounced in their pursuit of enlightenment.

Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it.

Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said: O almighty Lord, how can I possibly describe You? You awaken the vital air, which then impels the mind, senses and power of speech to act. This is true for all ordinary conditioned souls and even for great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva. So it is certainly true for me. Nevertheless, You become the intimate friend of those who worship You.

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, these two personal forms of Yours have appeared in order  to bestow the ultimate benefit for the three worlds—the cessation of material misery and the conquest of death. My Lord, although You create this universe and then assume many transcendental forms to protect it, You also swallow it up, just like a spider who spins and later withdraws its web.

Because You are the protector and the supreme controller of all moving and nonmoving beings, anyone who takes shelter of Your lotus feet can never be touched by the contamination of material work, material qualities or time. Great sages who have assimilated the essential meaning of the Vedaṣ offer their prayers to You. To gain Your association, they bow down to You at every opportunity and constantly worship You and meditate upon You.

My dear Lord, even Lord Brahmā, who enjoys his exalted position for the entire duration of the universe, fears the passage of time. Then what to speak of those whom Brahmā creates, the conditioned souls. They encounter fearful dangers at every step of their lives. I do not know of any relief from this fear except shelter at Your lotus feet, which are the very form of liberation.

By attaining You—the Supreme Godhead and the master of the soul—one attains everything desirable.

O my Lord, O supreme friend of the conditioned soul, although for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world You accept the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, which constitute Your illusory potency, You specifically employ the mode of goodness to liberate the conditioned souls. The other two modes simply bring them suffering, illusion and fear.

Intelligent persons thus worship Your beloved transcendental form, composed of pure goodness, along with the spiritual forms of Your pure devotees.

A materialist, his intelligence perverted by the action of his deceptive senses, cannot recognize You at all, although You are always present within his own senses and heart and also among the objects of his perception. Yet even though one's understanding has been covered by Your illusory potency, if one obtains Vedic knowledge from You, the supreme spiritual master of all, he can directly understand You.

My dear Lord, the Vedic literatures alone reveal confidential knowledge of Your supreme personality, and thus even such great scholars as Lord Brahmā himself are bewildered in their attempt to understand You through empirical methods. Each philosopher understands You according to his particular speculative conclusions. I worship that Supreme Person, knowledge of whom is hidden by the bodily designations covering the conditioned soul's spiritual identity.

na—not; etāvatā—by such (a show of humility); bhagavataḥ—of the Personality of Godhead; sva-māyā—of His own illusory energy; maya—consisting of; vṛttibhiḥ—by the activities; na duṣyeta—is not spoiled; anubhāvaḥ—the power; taiḥ—by them; māyinaḥ—of a magician; kuhakam—the tricks; yathā—just as.
This apparent humility is simply a show of mercy. Such behavior of the Supreme Lord and His personal associates, which the Lord effects by His own bewildering potency, does not spoil His power any more than a magician's powers are diminished by his exhibition of tricks.

sṛṣṭvedaṁ manasā viśvam
ātmanānupraviśya yaḥ
guṇaiḥ kurvadbhir ābhāti
karteva svapna-dṛg yathā
tasmai namo bhagavate
tri-guṇāya guṇātmane
kevalāyādvitīyāya
gurave brahma-mūrtaye
sṛṣṭvā—creating; idam—this; manasā—by His mind, simply by His desire; viśvam—the universe; ātmanā—as the Supersoul; anupraviśya—subsequently entering; yaḥ—who; guṇaiḥ—by the modes of nature; kurvadbhiḥ—which are acting; ābhāti—appears; kartā iva—as if the doer; svapna-dṛk—a person who is seeing a dream; yathā—as; tasmai—unto Him; namaḥ—obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tri-guṇāya—who possesses the three modes of nature; guṇa-ātmane—who is the ultimate controller of the modes of nature; kevalāya—to the pure; advitīyāya—who has no equal; gurave—the supreme spiritual master; brahma-mūrtaye—the personal form of the Absolute Truth.
I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created this entire universe simply by His desire and then entered into it as the Supersoul. By making the modes of nature act, He seems to be the direct creator of this world, just as a dreamer seems to be acting within his dream. He is the owner and ultimate controller of the three modes of nature, yet He remains alone and pure, without any equal. He is the supreme spiritual master of all, the original personal form of the Absolute Truth.
