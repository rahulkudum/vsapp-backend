tvāṁ sevatāṁ sura-kṛtā bahavo 'ntarāyāḥ
svauko vilaṅghya paramaṁ vrajatāṁ padaṁ te
nānyasya barhiṣi balīn dadataḥ sva-bhāgān
dhatte padaṁ tvam avitā yadi vighna-mūrdhni
tvām—You; sevatām—for those who are serving; sura-kṛtāḥ—made by the demigods; bahavaḥ—many; antarāyāḥ—disturbances; sva-okaḥ—their own abode (the planets of the demigods); vilaṅghya—crossing beyond; paramam—the supreme; vrajatām—who are going; padam—to the abode; te—Your; na—there are not such; anyasya—for another; barhiṣi—in ritual sacrifices; balīn—offerings; dadataḥ—for one who is giving; sva-bhāgān—their own shares (of the demigods); dhatte—(the devotee) places; padam—his foot; tvam—You; avitā—the protector; yadi—because; vighna—of the disturbance; mūrdhni—upon the head.
The demigods place many obstacles on the path of those who worship You to transcend the temporary abodes of the demigods and reach Your supreme abode. Those who offer the demigods their assigned shares in sacrificial performances encounter no such obstacles. But because You are the direct protector of Your devotee, he is able to step over the head of whatever obstacle the demigods place before him.

kṣut-tṛṭ-tri-kāla-guṇa-māruta-jaihva-śaiśnyān
asmān apāra-jaladhīn atitīrya kecit
krodhasya yānti viphalasya vaśaṁ pade gor
majjanti duścara-tapaś ca vṛthotsṛjanti
kṣut—hunger; tṛṭ—thirst; tri-kāla-guṇa—the manifestations of the three phases of time (such as heat and cold, rain and so on); māruta—wind; jaihva—enjoyment of the tongue; śaiśnyān—and of the genitals; asmān—ourselves (in all these forms); apāra—limitless; jala-dhīn—oceans; atitīrya—having crossed over; kecit—some persons; krodhasya—of anger; yānti—they come; viphalasya—which is fruitless; vaśam—under the sway; pade—in the foot(print); goḥ—of a cow; majjanti—they drown; duścara—difficult to execute; tapaḥ—their austerities; ca—and; vṛthā—without any good purpose; utsṛjanti—they throw away.
Some men practice severe penances to cross beyond our influence, which is like an immeasurable ocean with endless waves of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and the other conditions brought about by the passing of time, such as the sensuous wind and the urges of the tongue and sex organs. Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.

śrī-devā ūcuḥ
natāḥ sma te nātha padāravindaṁ
buddhīndriya-prāṇa-mano-vacobhiḥ
yac cintyate 'ntar hṛdi bhāva-yuktair

The demigods began to speak: Our dear Lord, advanced mystic yogis, striving for liberation from the severe bondage of material work, meditate with great devotion upon Your lotus feet within their hearts. Dedicating our intelligence, senses, vital air, mind and power of speech to Your Lordship, we demigods bow down at Your lotus feet.

tvaṁ māyayā tri-guṇayātmani durvibhāvyaṁ
vyaktaṁ sṛjasy avasi lumpasi tad-guṇa-sthaḥ

tvam—You; māyayā—by the material energy; tri-guṇayā—made up of the three modes of nature; ātmani—within Yourself; durvibhāvyam—inconceivable; vyaktam—the manifest cosmos; sṛjasi—You create; avasi—protect; lumpasi—and destroy; tat—of that material nature; guṇa—within the modes (goodness, passion and ignorance); sthaḥ—situated; na—not; etaiḥ—by these; bhavān—You; ajita—O unconquerable Lord; karmabhiḥ—activities; ajyate—are entangled; vai—at all; yat—because; sve—in Your own; sukhe—happiness; avyavahite—unimpeded; abhirataḥ—You are always absorbed; anavadyaḥ—the unimpeachable Lord.
O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain and devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent of māyā, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never affected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal spiritual bliss, and thus You cannot be accused of any material infection.

O worshipable Lord, those whose consciousness is polluted by illusion may try to purify themselves by ordinary worship, study of the Vedas, charity, austerity and ritual activities, but the purification they achieve is never as great as that attained by those pure souls who have developed a powerful transcendental faith in Your glories by regularly hearing them, O greatest of all.

syān nas tavāṅghrir aśubhāśaya-dhūmaketuḥ
kṣemāya yo munibhir ārdra-hṛdohyamānaḥ

Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. May Your lotus feet become the blazing fire that burns to ashes all our inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.

Those about to offer oblations into the fire of sacrifice in accordance with the Ṛg, Yajur and Sāma Vedas meditate on Your lotus feet. Similarly, the practitioners of transcendental yoga meditate upon Your lotus feet, hoping for knowledge about Your divine mystic potency, and the most elevated pure devotees perfectly worship Your lotus feet, desiring to cross beyond Your illusory potency.

O almighty Lord, You are so kind to Your servants that You have accepted the withered flower garland that we have placed on Your chest. Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lakṣmī and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.

O omnipotent Lord, in Your incarnation as Trivikrama, You raised Your leg like a flagpole to break the shell of the universe, allowing the holy Ganges to flow down, like a banner of victory, in three branches throughout the three planetary systems. By three mighty steps of Your lotus feet, Your Lordship captured Bali Mahārāja, along with his universal kingdom. Your lotus feet inspire fear in the demons by driving them down to hell and fearlessness among Your devotees by elevating them to the perfection of heavenly life. We are sincerely trying to worship You, our Lord; therefore may Your lotus feet kindly free us from all of our sinful reactions.

nasy ota-gāva iva yasya vaśe bhavanti

You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the transcendental entity who is superior to both material nature and the enjoyer of nature. May Your lotus feet bestow transcendental pleasure upon us. All of the great demigods, beginning with Brahmā, are embodied living entities. Struggling painfully with one another under the strict control of Your time factor, they are just like bulls dragged by ropes tied through their pierced noses.

As the threefold wheel of time You diminish all things by Your imperceptible actions, and thus You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My dear Lord, the original puruṣa-avatāra, Mahā-Viṣṇu, acquires His creative potency from You. Thus with infallible energy He impregnates material nature, producing the mahat-tattva. Then the mahat-tattva, the amalgamated material energy, endowed with the potency of the Lord, produces from itself the primeval golden egg of the universe, which is covered by various layers of material elements.

O Lord, You are the supreme creator of this universe and the ultimate controller of all moving and nonmoving living entities. You are Hṛṣīkeśa, the supreme controller of all sensory activity, and thus You never become contaminated or entangled in the course of Your supervision of the infinite sensory activities within the material creation. On the other hand, other living entities, even yogīs and philosophers, are disturbed and frightened simply by remembering the material objects that they have supposedly renounced in their pursuit of enlightenment.

Those who are striving for purification associate with the holy narrations of Your glories by hearing them with their ears, and they associate with the holy rivers flowing from Your lotus feet by physically bathing in them.

I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original and greatest of all beings, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is the author of the Vedas, and just to destroy His devotees' fear of material existence, like a bee He has collected this nectarean essence of all knowledge and self-realization. Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it.

Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said: O almighty Lord, how can I possibly describe You? You awaken the vital air, which then impels the mind, senses and power of speech to act. This is true for all ordinary conditioned souls and even for great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva. So it is certainly true for me. Nevertheless, You become the intimate friend of those who worship You.

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, these two personal forms of Yours have appeared in order  to bestow the ultimate benefit for the three worlds—the cessation of material misery and the conquest of death. My Lord, although You create this universe and then assume many transcendental forms to protect it, You also swallow it up, just like a spider who spins and later withdraws its web.

Because You are the protector and the supreme controller of all moving and nonmoving beings, anyone who takes shelter of Your lotus feet can never be touched by the contamination of material work, material qualities or time. Great sages who have assimilated the essential meaning of the Vedaṣ offer their prayers to You. To gain Your association, they bow down to You at every opportunity and constantly worship You and meditate upon You.

My dear Lord, even Lord Brahmā, who enjoys his exalted position for the entire duration of the universe, fears the passage of time. Then what to speak of those whom Brahmā creates, the conditioned souls. They encounter fearful dangers at every step of their lives. I do not know of any relief from this fear except shelter at Your lotus feet, which are the very form of liberation.

Therefore I worship Your lotus feet, having renounced my identification with the material body and everything else that covers my true self. These useless, insubstantial and temporary coverings are merely presumed to be separate from You, whose intelligence encompasses all truth. By attaining You—the Supreme Godhead and the master of the soul—one attains everything desirable.

māyā-mayāḥ sthiti-layodaya-hetavo 'sya
līlā dhṛtā yad api sattva-mayī praśāntyai
nānye nṛṇāṁ vyasana-moha-bhiyaś ca yābhyām
sattvam—goodness; rajaḥ—passion; tamaḥ—ignorance; iti—the modes of nature thus termed; īśa—O Lord; tava—Your; ātma-bandho—O supreme friend of the soul; māyā-mayāḥ—produced from Your personal energy; sthiti-laya-udaya—of maintenance, destruction and creation; hetavaḥ—the causes; asya—of this universe; līlāḥ—as pastimes; dhṛtāḥ—assumed; yat api—although; sattva-mayī—that which is in the mode of goodness; praśāntyai—for liberation; na—not; anye—the other two; nṛṇām—for persons; vyasana—danger; moha—bewilderment; bhiyaḥ—and fear; ca—also; yābhyām—from which.
O my Lord, O supreme friend of the conditioned soul, although for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world You accept the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, which constitute Your illusory potency, You specifically employ the mode of goodness to liberate the conditioned souls. The other two modes simply bring them suffering, illusion and fear.

tasmāt taveha bhagavann atha tāvakānāṁ
śuklāṁ tanuṁ sva-dayitāṁ kuśalā bhajanti
yat sātvatāḥ puruṣa-rūpam uśanti sattvaṁ
loko yato 'bhayam utātma-sukhaṁ na cānyat
tasmāt—therefore; tava—Your; iha—in this world; bhagavan—O Supreme Lord; atha—and; tāvakānām—of Your devotees; śuklām—transcendental; tanum—the personal form; sva-dayitām—most dear to them; kuśalāḥ—those who are expert in spiritual knowledge; bhajanti—worship; yat—because; sātvatāḥ—the great devotees; puruṣa—of the original Personality of Godhead; rūpam—the form; uśanti—consider; sattvam—the mode of goodness; lokaḥ—the spiritual world; yataḥ—from which; abhayam—fearlessness; uta—and; ātma-sukham—the happiness of the soul; na—not; ca—and; anyat—any other.
O Lord, because fearlessness, spiritual happiness and the kingdom of God are all achieved through the mode of pure goodness, Your devotees consider this mode, but never passion and ignorance, to be a direct manifestation of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Intelligent persons thus worship Your beloved transcendental form, composed of pure goodness, along with the spiritual forms of Your pure devotees.

tasmai namo bhagavate puruṣāya bhūmne
viśvāya viśva-gurave para-daivatāya
nārāyaṇāya ṛṣaye ca narottamāya

I offer my humble obeisances to Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the all-pervading and all-inclusive form of the universe, as well as its spiritual master. I bow down to Lord Nārāyaṇa, the supremely worshipable Deity appearing as a sage, and also to the saintly Nara, the best of human beings, who is fixed in perfect goodness, fully in control of his speech, and the propagator of the Vedic literatures.

yaṁ vai na veda vitathākṣa-pathair bhramad-dhīḥ
santaṁ svakeṣv asuṣu hṛdy api dṛk-patheṣu
tan-māyayāvṛta-matiḥ sa u eva sākṣād
ādyas tavākhila-guror upasādya vedam
yam—whom; vai—indeed; na veda—does not recognize; vitatha—deceptive; akṣa-pathaiḥ—by methods of empirical perception; bhramat—becoming diverted; dhīḥ—whose intelligence; santam—present; svakeṣu—within one's own; asuṣu—senses; hṛdi—within the heart; api—even; dṛk-patheṣu—among perceived objects of the external world; tat-māyayā—by His illusory potency; āvṛta—covered over; matiḥ—his understanding; saḥ—he; u—even; eva—indeed; sākṣāt—directly; ādyaḥ—originally (in ignorance); tava—of You; akhila-guroḥ—the spiritual master of all living beings; upasādya—obtaining; vedam—the knowledge of the Vedas.
A materialist, his intelligence perverted by the action of his deceptive senses, cannot recognize You at all, although You are always present within his own senses and heart and also among the objects of his perception. Yet even though one's understanding has been covered by Your illusory potency, if one obtains Vedic knowledge from You, the supreme spiritual master of all, he can directly understand You.

yad-darśanaṁ nigama ātma-rahaḥ-prakāśaṁ
muhyanti yatra kavayo 'ja-parā yatantaḥ
taṁ sarva-vāda-viṣaya-pratirūpa-śīlaṁ
vande mahā-puruṣam ātma-nigūḍha-bodham
yat—of whom; darśanam—the vision; nigame—in the Vedas; ātma—of the Supreme Soul; rahaḥ—the mystery; prakāśam—which reveals; muhyanti—become bewildered; yatra—about which; kavayaḥ—great learned authorities; aja-parāḥ—headed by Brahmā; yatantaḥ—endeavoring; tam—to Him; sarva-vāda—of all different philosophies; viṣaya—the subject matter; pratirūpa—adjusting itself as suitable; śīlam—whose personal nature; vande—I offer my homage; mahā-puruṣam—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ātma—from the spirit soul; nigūḍha—hidden; bodham—understanding.
My dear Lord, the Vedic literatures alone reveal confidential knowledge of Your supreme personality, and thus even such great scholars as Lord Brahmā himself are bewildered in their attempt to understand You through empirical methods. Each philosopher understands You according to his particular speculative conclusions. I worship that Supreme Person, knowledge of whom is hidden by the bodily designations covering the conditioned soul's spiritual identity.

Again and again I offer my obeisances unto you, O all-auspicious transcendental personality. As the lord of goodness you give pleasure, in contact with the mode of passion you appear most fearful, and you also associate with the mode of ignorance.

Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said: It is indeed most difficult for embodied souls to understand the pastimes of the universal controllers, for such lords bow down to and offer praise to the very living beings they rule.

Generally it is to induce embodied souls to accept religious principles that the authorized teachers of religion exhibit ideal behavior while encouraging and praising the proper behavior of others.

This apparent humility is simply a show of mercy. Such behavior of the Supreme Lord and His personal associates, which the Lord effects by His own bewildering potency, does not spoil His power any more than a magician's powers are diminished by his exhibition of tricks.

sṛṣṭvedaṁ manasā viśvam
ātmanānupraviśya yaḥ
guṇaiḥ kurvadbhir ābhāti
karteva svapna-dṛg yathā
tasmai namo bhagavate
tri-guṇāya guṇātmane
kevalāyādvitīyāya
gurave brahma-mūrtaye
sṛṣṭvā—creating; idam—this; manasā—by His mind, simply by His desire; viśvam—the universe; ātmanā—as the Supersoul; anupraviśya—subsequently entering; yaḥ—who; guṇaiḥ—by the modes of nature; kurvadbhiḥ—which are acting; ābhāti—appears; kartā iva—as if the doer; svapna-dṛk—a person who is seeing a dream; yathā—as; tasmai—unto Him; namaḥ—obeisances; bhagavate—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tri-guṇāya—who possesses the three modes of nature; guṇa-ātmane—who is the ultimate controller of the modes of nature; kevalāya—to the pure; advitīyāya—who has no equal; gurave—the supreme spiritual master; brahma-mūrtaye—the personal form of the Absolute Truth.
I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created this entire universe simply by His desire and then entered into it as the Supersoul. By making the modes of nature act, He seems to be the direct creator of this world, just as a dreamer seems to be acting within his dream. He is the owner and ultimate controller of the three modes of nature, yet He remains alone and pure, without any equal. He is the supreme spiritual master of all, the original personal form of the Absolute Truth.
