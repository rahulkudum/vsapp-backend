Narasimha Stotras

Publisher's note

We tried our best to serve the Vaiṣṇavas by compiling this book, Nṛsiṁha Stotra Mala. Since wanted to convey the meanings of the Sanskrit prayers the best we could, sometimes the English may seem quaint as the form of Sanskrit the ācāryas use in the composition of stotrams is very poetic and often beyond dictionary expression. Sometimes anārthas are referred to as dangerous wild animals or as enemies to be destroyed by the Lord. Often reference is made to unknown Purāṇic stories or to places that are not even on this planet in the present creation. We were frequently baffled by such difficulties, but somehow Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva allowed this project to be completed as a service to His devotees. Besides mercifully overlooking our shortcomings, please inform us of any nice Nṛsiṁha prayers in your possession which were not included in this book.

Foreword
Offering prayers to the Lord is the most essential item in the devotional process. Through the medium of prayer one can reveal one's mind to the Lord and also understand the mood and method of surrender of the great ācāryas. 
The two kinds of prayer recommended are reciting the prayers of others, in other words the ācāryas' prayers, and offering one's own prayers. Both are recommended in the process of Deity worship.  By reciting the prayers of the ācāryas we can understand and develop our own understandings - how to approach the Lord through our service, our relationships with the Lord and the devotees, and how to behave in various situations in devotional service. And by offering our own prayers, our heartfelt feelings can be expressed to the Lord. This helps to develop one's relationship with the Lord, which is the perfection of human life.
We may have the tendency to be too caught up in the externals of our service and not always remember whom or why we are serving. But by offering prayers we dig out what is in our hearts and show it to the Lord.  We have to think deeply; we have to mean what we say; we have to meditate on how to improve our devotional service and we have to come up to the standard of prayer that has been offered by the ācāryas. This gives us some moments of contemplation - private moments between us, our spiritual master, the previous ācāryas and Kṛṣṇa.
Here in this book we have collected prayers specifically for Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva is a very special avatāra of the Lord and not just one of the ten avatāras. We must remember that Nanda Maharaja's deity is Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. In Kṛṣṇa's house the form of Viṣṇu is worshipped as Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. Śrīla Rupa Goswami states in his Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu Bindhu that of Kṛṣṇa, Nrsimha, Lord Caitanaya, and Lord Ramacandra, all of whom are fully the Supreme Lord, only Kṛṣṇa in Vrndavana fully manifests all the opulences of His svayam form. Nṛsiṁhadeva is not like the other Visnu mūrtis, but is fully Kṛṣṇa, and He comes to protect His devotees. Paritrāṇaya sādhūnām - He comes to protect Prahlāda Mahārāja, who is surrendered to Him. Vināśaya ca duṣkṛtam --and as a side activity He kills Hiraṇyakaśipu and establishes dharma. 
Nṛsiṁhadeva is Bhakta-vatsala, very dear to His devotees. If we please Nṛsiṁhadeva with  prayers, He can free us from the contaminations within our hearts and can establish within us the desire for pure unalloyed devotional service. Thus we may become fully protected by the Lord, feel our relationship with Him, and know that the obstacles disturbing our devotional service are being removed.
We hope that this small book will be of some use for the Vaisnavas in their service to the Lord, and in their offering prayers to Nṛsiṁhadeva to achieve this noblest of goals. 
Oṁ tat sat.

He is without beginning or end. He is unborn, unperishable and unmeasurable. He is the original Lord and His eyes are like flames brilliant as the sun and the moon.

Him the all auspicious Nṛsiṁha appears in different forms such as Varāha or Vāmana. He Whose heart is always absorbed in a sporting mood, is worshipped by the king of the devas.

Song 3 Śrī Nṛsiṁha Mahā-mantra

TEXT 1 
ugraṁ vīraṁ mahā-viṣṇuṁ
jvalantaṁ sarvato mukham /
nṛsiṁhaṁ bhīṣaṇaṁ bhadraṁ
mṛtyur mṛtyuṁ namāmy ahaṁ //

“I bow down to Lord Nṛsiṁha who is ferocious and heroic like Lord Viṣṇu. He is burning from every side. He is terrific, auspicious and the death of death personified.”

This mantra is quoted or at least referred to in many scriptures. The Nṛsiṁha Tapāni Upaniṣad also gives the history of this mantra. In the last creation the presiding deity was Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva and this was the mantra inspiring the entire creation into which Lord Brahmā was initiated, as in the present creation the presiding deity is Śrī Kṛṣṇa and He initiated Brahmā into the Kāma-Gāyatri.

In Jagannātha Purī the pūjāris believe that Lord Jagannātha is from the previous creation and was originally worshipped as Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. Jagannātha Purī Dhāma floats on the ocean of devastation and is thus never destroyed. Every twelve or nineteen years the Deities' forms are changed. The installation yajña for the new Deities takes about two weeks and is mainly comprised of a Nṛsiṁha mantrawhich is chanted 20,000 times. 


Song 4 Nṛsiṁha gāyatrī

TEXT 1
 oṁ vajra-nakāya vidmahe 
 tīkṣṇa daṁstrāya dhīmahi
 tan no narasiṁhaḥ pracodayāt(e)

“Let us meditate on He who is known as the possessor of nails as hard as thunderbolts and sharp teeth. Let us be enthused by Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva.”

The original gāyatrī mantra, the Kāma-gāyatrī, glorifies the qualities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth. Each expansion of the original Śrī Kṛṣṇa has unique attributes, which are glorified in corresponding gāyatrī mantras, all of which expand from the original Kāma-gāyatrī. These gāyatrī mantras are mainly used in Deity worship.



Song 5 Prayers by Śrī Madhvācārya

TEXT 1
deva nṛsiṁha hiraṇyaka-śatro
sarva-bhayantaka daivatā-bandho

“I bow to You. O divine Nṛsiṁha –enemy of the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu, terminator of all fears. And benefactor of the demigods.” (Dvādaśa Stotram –6.5)


TEXT 2

“O victorious and immaculate Nrhari, who rends the heart of the very strong son of Diti, O Rama object of the holiest scriptures, Supreme One, always lusterous, the sole cause of the universe, be my refuge.” (Dvādaśa Stotram 9.8)



Song 6 Śrī Narasiṁha Naka Stuti

Śrī Narasiṁha Naka Stuti was written by Śrīpāda Madhvācārya as an introduction to Śrī Vāyu Stuti which was written by Śrī Paṇḍit Trivikramācārya, a disciple of Madhvācārya. Up to the present time Vāyu Stuti is one of the main stutis of those following in the line of Śrīla Madhvācārya. It is chanted daily as a parāyaṇa. It was very much to the liking of Madhvācārya who therefore wrote this short stuti as an introduction.

TEXT 1
pāntvasmān purūhutavairi balavanmātanga mādyadghatā
kumbhoccādri vipātanādhi kapatu pratyekavajrāyitāḥ /

pradhvasta dhvātaśānta pravitata manasā bhāvitā nakivṛnda //

May the wide spread and auspicious nails of the lion-faced Lord, Narasiṁha who is in the company of His consort Lakṣmī protect us. His nails are like thunderbolts and are highly skilled in tearing asunder the lofty mountain like heads of the herds of strong and intoxicated elephants in the forms of demons, the foes of Indra. 

TEXT 2 
lakṣmīkānta samantato vikalayan naiveśitus te saman
 paśyāmyuttama vastu dūratārato pāstam rasoyo stumaḥ /

khadyotopamavisphylinya bhasitā brahmeśuśakrot karāḥ //

O consort of Lakṣmī ! Although I've an all around study of the śāstras I don't find anything equal to You, my dear master. There is nothing superior to You. Brahmā, śiva, Indra and their hosts are reduced to ashes by the sparks of fire resembling sparkling glowworms issuing from the curved edge of Your right eye filled with masses of wrath. 



Song 7 Śrī Narasiṁha Stuti 

Śrī Narasiṁha Stuti is written by Paṇḍit Trivikramācārya one of the leading disciples of Śrīpāda Madhvācārya. Śrīpāda Madhvācārya defeated Paṇḍita Trivikramācārya at Viṣṇu-maṅgalaṁ after a 15 day debate. The discussion ended with the surrender of the Paṇḍit who gave up monism, his previous belief. He was a very learned scholar and therefore after his convertion Madhva asked him to write a commentary on his Sūtra Bhāṣya commentary of the Vedānta Sūtra, which was called Tattva-Pradīpikā. He is also the author of the Vāyu-Stuti which upto the present day is one of the main parāyaṇas for the followers of Śrīpāda Madhvācārya. According to his diary was the famous biography of Madhvācārya, Śrī Madhva Vijaya written by his son Paṇḍit Nārāyaṇācārya.

Song 12 Prayers from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam

The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam itself contains enough prayers for an entire book therefore we tried to focus more on verses that describe the form or the activities of the Lord.

TEXT 1
caturdaśaṁ nārasiṁhaṁ
bibhrad daityendram ūrjitam /
dadāra karajair ūrāv
erakāṁ kaṭa-kṛd yathā //

In the fourteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as Nṛsiṁha and bifurcated the strong body of the atheist Hiraṇyakaśipu with His nails, just as a carpenter pierces cane (1.3.18).

TEXT 2
trai-piṣṭaporu-bhaya-hā sa nṛsiṁha-rūpaṁ
kṛtvā bhramad-bhrukuṭi-daṁṣṭra-karāla-vaktram /
daityendram āṣu gadayābhipatantam ārād
ūrau nipātya vidadāra nakhaiḥ sphurantam //

The Personality of Godhead assumed the incarnation of Nṛsiṁhadeva in order to vanquish the great fears of the demigods. He killed the king of the demons, Hiraṇyakaśipu, who challenged the Lord with a club in his hand, by placing the demon on His thighs and piercing him with His nails, rolling His eyebrows in anger and showing His fearful teeth and mouth (2.7.14).

TEXT 3
oṁ namo bhagavate narasiṁhāya
namas tejas-tejase āvir-āvirbhava 
vajra-nakha vajra-daṁṣṭra karmāsayān /
randhaya randhaya tamo grasa grasa oṁ svāhā 
abhayam abhayam ātmani bhūyiṣṭhā oṁ kṣrauṁ //

I offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, the source of all power. O my Lord who possesses nails and teeth just like thunderbolts, kindly vanquish our demoniac desires for fruitive activity in the material world. Please appear in our hearts and drive away our ignorance, so that by Your mercy we may become fearless in the struggle for existance in this material world (5.18.8).

TEXT 4
dugeṣv aṭavy-āli-mukhādiṣu prabhuḥ
pāyān nṛsiṁho 'sura-yūthapāraiḥ /
 vimuñcato yasya mahāṭṭa-hāsaṁ
diśo vinedur nyapataṁś ca grabhāḥ //

May Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, who appeared as the enemy of Hiraṇyakaśipu, protect me in all directions. His loud laughing vibrated in all directions and caused the pregnant wives of the asuras to have miscarriages. May that Lord be kind to protect me in difficult places like the forest and battlefront (6.8.14).

TEXT 5
vidikṣu dikṣūrdhvam adhaḥ samantād
antar bahir bhagavān nārasiṁhaḥ /
prahāpayal loka-bhayaṁ svanena
sva-tejasā grasta-samasta-tejāḥ //

Prahlāda Mahārāja loudly chanted the Holy Name of Lord Nṛsiṁha. May Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, roaring for His devotee, Prahlāda Mahārāja, protect us from all fear of dangers created by stalwart leaders in all directions through poison, weapons, water, fire, air and so on. May the Lord cover their influence by His own transcendental influence. May Nṛsiṁhadeva protect us from all directions and in all corners, above, below, within and without (6.8.34). 

TEXT 6
saṁrambha-duṣprekṣya-karāla-locano
vyāttānanāntam vilihan sva-jihvayā /
asṛg-lavākatāruṇa-keśarānano
yathāntra-mālī dvipa-hatyayā hariḥ //

The hair on Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva's face, being sprinkled with drops of blood, was reddish and looked very beautiful. Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva pierced Hiraṇyakaśipu's abdomen with His nails, pulled out the demon's intestines and wore them as a garland, which enhanced His beauty. Thus the Lord became very fearsome, like a lion engaged in fighting an elephant (7.8.30).

TEXT 7
nakhāṅkurotpāṭita-hṛt-saroruhaṁ
visṛjya-tasyānucarān udāyudhān /
ahan samastān nakha-śastra-pāṇibhir
drodaṇḍa-yūrtho 'nupathān sahasraśaḥ //

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had many, many arms, first uprooted Hiraṇyakaśipu's heart and then threw him aside and turned toward the demon's soldiers. These soldiers had come in thousands to fight with Him with raised weapons and were very faithful followers of Hiraṇyakaśipu, but Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva killed all of them merely with the ends of His nails (7.8.31).

TEXT 8
saṭāvadhūtā jaladāḥ parāpatan
grahāś ca tad-dṛṣṭi-vimuṣṭa-rociṣaḥ /
ambhodhayaḥ śvāsa-hatā vicukṣubhur
nirhrāda-bhītā digibhā vicukruṣuḥ //

The hair on Nṛsiṁhadeva's head shook the clouds and scattered them here and there, His glaring eyes stole the effulgence of the luminaries in the sky, and His breathing agitated the seas and oceans. Because of His roaring, all the elephants in the world began to cry in fear (7.8.32).

TEXT 9
dyaus tat-saṭotkṣipta-vimāna-saṇkulā
protsarpata kṣamā ca padābhipīḍitā /
śailāḥ samutpetur amuṣya raṁhasā
tat-tejasā khaṁ kakubho na rejire //

The airplanes of the devas were thrown into outer space and the upper planetary system by the hair on Nṛsiṁhadeva's head. Because of the pressure of the Lord's lotus feet, the earth appeared to slip from its position, and all the hills and mountains sprang up due to His intolerable force. Because of the Lord's bodily effulgence, both the sky and all directions diminished in their natural illumination (7.8.33).

TEXT 10
tataḥ sabhāyām upaviṣṭam uttame
nṛpāsane sambhṛta-tehjasaṁ vibhum /
alakṣita-dvairatham atyamarṣaṇaṁ
pracaṇḍa-vaktraṁ na babhāja kaścana //

Manifesting a full effulgence and a fearsome countenance, Lord Nṛsiṁha, being very angry and finding no contestant to face His power and opulence, then sat down in the assembly hall on the excellent throne of the king. Because of fear and obedience, no one could come forward to serve the Lord directly (7.8.34).

TEXT 11
evaṁ sva-karma-patitaṁ bhava-vaitaraṇyām
anyonya-janma-maraṇāśana-bhīta-bhītam /
paśyañ janaṁ sva-para-vigraha-vaira-maitraṁ
hanteti pāracara pīpṛhi mūḍham adya //

My dear Lord, You are always transcendentally situated on the other side of the river of death, but because of the reactions of our own activities, we are suffering on this side. Indeed, we have fallen into this river and are repeatedly suffering the pains of birth and death and eating horrible things. Now kindly look upon us-not only upon me but also upon all others who are suffering-and by Your causeless mercy and compassion, deliver us and maintain us (7.9.41).

TEXT 12
ko nv atra te 'khila-guro bhagavan prayāsa
uttāraṇe 'sya bhava-sambhava-lopa-hetoḥ /
mūdheṣu vai mahad-anugraha ārta-bandho
kiṁ tena te priya-janān anusevatāṁ naḥ //

O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, original spiritual master of the entire world, what is the difficulty for You, who manage the affairs of the universe, in delivering the fallen souls engaged in Your devotional service? You are the friend of all suffering humanity, and for great personalities it is necessary to show mercy to the foolish. Therefore I think that You will show Your causeless mercy to persons like us, who engage in Your service (7.9.42).

TEXT 13
oṁ namo bhagavate tubhyaṁ
puruṣāya mahātmane /
haraye 'dbhuta-siṁhāya
brahmaṇe paramātmaṇe //

O my Lord, full of six opulences, O Supreme Person! O Supreme Soul, killer of all miseries! O Supreme Person in the form of a lion and man, let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You! (7.10.10).

TEXT 14
etad ya ādi-puruṣasya mṛgendra-līlāṁ
daityendra-yūtha-pa-vadhaṁ prayataḥ paṭheta /
daityātmajasya ca satāṁ pravarasya puṇyaṁ
śrutvānubhāvam akuto-bhayam eti lokam //

 Prahlāda Mahārāja was the best among exalted devotees. Anyone who with great attention hears this narration concerning the activities of Prahlāda Mahārāja, the killing of Hiraṇyakaśipu, and the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nṛsiṁhadeva, surely reaches the spiritual world, where there is no anxiety (7.10.47.).

TEXT 15
namas te 'dbhuta-siṁhāya

Song 13 Ugra-Nṛsiṁha dhyāna
In the practical aspects of deity worship there is a section called yoga or purificatory procedures, performed just before the worship of the deities. Dhyāna, meditation on the form of the Lord for the purification of the mind, is a part of yoga. These prayers of the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam are the dhyāna mantras in the worship of Ugra Nṛsiṁha.

Hiraṇyakaśipu studied the form of the Lord, trying to decide who the form of Nṛsiṁhadeva standing before him was. The Lord's form was extremely fearsome because of His angry eyes, which resembled molten gold; His shining mane, which expanded the dimensions of His fearful face; His deadly teeth; and His razor-sharp tongue, which moved about like a dueling sword. His ears were erect and motionless, and His nostrils and gaping mouth appeared like caves of a mountain. His jaws parted fearfully, and His entire body touched the sky. His neck was very short and thick, His chest broad, His waist thin, and the hairs on His body as white as the rays of the moon. His arms, which resembled flanks of soldiers, spread in all directions as He killed the demons, rogues and atheists with His conchshell, disc, club, lotus and other natural weapons (7.8.19-22).

Song 26 Prayers by Śrīdhara Swāmī

Śrīla Śrīdhāra Swāmī was a very advanced vaiṣṇava coming in the line of Viṣṇu Swāmī's sampradāya. His commentaries on Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and other scriptures were not only accepted but very much appreciated too by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The principle Deity of his sampradāya is Nṛsiṁhadeva therefore Śrīdhāra Swāmī composed many prayers in glorification of the Lord.
In his commentary on the First Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.1.1), Śrīdhāra Swāmī describes Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva in this way:

TEXT 1
prahlāda-hṛdayāhlādaḥ
bhaktāvidyā-vidāraṇam /
śarad-indu-ruciṁ vande
pārīndra-vadanaṁ harim //

Let me offer my obeisances unto Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, who is always enlightening Prahlāda Mahārāja within his heart and who always kills the nescience that attacks the devotees. His mercy is distributed like moonshine, and His face is like that of a lion. Let me offer my obeisances unto Him again and again.

TEXT 2
ugro 'py anugra evāyaṁ
sva-bhaktānāṁ nā-keśarī /
keśarīva sva-potānām
anyeṇāṁ ugra-vikramaḥ //

Although very ferocious, the lioness is very kind to her cubs. Similarly, although very ferocious to non devotees like Hiraṇyakaśipu, Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva is very, very soft and kind to devotees like Prahlāda Mahārāja.

TEXT 3
vāg-īśā yasya vadane
lakṣmīr yasya ca vakṣasi /
yasyāste hṛdaye samvit
taṁ nṛsiṁham ahaṁ bhaje //

Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva is always assisted by Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, and He is always embracing to His chest the goddess of fortune. The Lord is always complete in knowledge within Himself. Let us offer obeisances unto Nṛsiṁhadeva.

TEXT 4
antar-yantā sarva-lokasya gītaḥ
śrutyā yuktyā caivam evāvaseyaḥ /
yaḥ sarva-jñaḥ sarva-śaktir nṛṣiṁhaḥ
Śrīmantaṁ taṁ cetasaivāvalambe //

In my heart I take shelter of Him who is glorified as the inner controller of all the worlds, and whom the Vedas ascertain in truth through logical reasoning. He is Nṛsiṁha, the omniscient and omnipotent Lord of the goddess of fortune.


Song 27 Śrī Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁhakaruṇa-rasa-stotra

This stotra was written by Śrīpāda Ādi śaṅkarācārya praying for the mercy of Śrī Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha Deva. This stotra is very similar in its prayerful mood to the other devotional writtings of Ādi śaṅkarācārya such as Govindāṣṭakam and Prabhodaśudhakāra about Lord Kṛṣṇa which reflect nothing of his impersonal teachings. śaṇkarācārya was an incarnation of Lord śiva but with the purpose of teaching the māyāvāda philosophy therefore the vaiṣṇava understanding is that the preaching of impersonalism was done by Mahimā a demoniac manifestation of Lord śiva. Such wonderful prayers are composed by the Sadāśiva form of śambhu.

TEXT 1
Śrīmat-payo-nidhi-niketana cakra-pāne
bhogindra-bhoga-maṇi-rājita puṇya-mūrte /

lakṣmi-nṛsiṁha mama dehi karāvalambam //

Lord, Your form is all beautiful because You are the master of the goddess of fortune. You reside in the ocean of milk, and You carry the Sudarśana disc in Your hand. Your all-auspicious form is made even more resplendent by the jewel like body of Anantadeva, the king of serpents upon whom You rest. You are the eternal deliverer from the ocean of birth and death for all those who seek Your shelter and You are the master of all mystics. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

TEXT 2

Lord Brahmā, Lord Indra, Lord śiva, the Maruts and the sun-god all fall down with their tens and millions of helmets at Your lotus feet, which are most dear to the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, who appeares as beautiful as a royal swan enjoying the lotus flower of Your chest. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

lakṣmi-nṛsiṁha mama dehi karāvalambam //

The conditioned soul suffers on the path of repeated birth and death exactly like one caught in a forest fire. Being very fearful, his body burnt by the licking flames, he cries most pitiably. Just as one tormented by a forest fire may take shelter in a pond. Your lotus feet are just like a pond giving refuge to the surrendered soul from the forest fire of saṁsāra. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

TEXT 4

O abode of the universe, I have fallen into the net of repeated birth and death. Just like an aquatic animal, I eagerly accept the hook baited with the sense objects. And just as the fish is caught trembling, and his head is cut off, so my real consciousness is lost as I am punished by the material nature. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

TEXT 6

lakṣmi-nṛsiṁha mama dehi karāvalambam //

You slay the king of the demons, Hiraṇyakaśipu, whose body is as strong as an elephant by squeezing him with Your hands. In this way You destroy all miseries by breaking the fearful cycle of birth and death. You are the ultimate goal of life for those who are disturbed by fear of material existence. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

TEXT 7

I have been bitten by the tens of millions of terrible sharp fangs of the snake of material existence. Having been injected with it's powerful poison, I have lost my consciousness as the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. The best remedy for snakebite is nectar, therefore O Lord śauri, You reside in the ocean of nectar and Your carrier is Garuḍa the great enemy of snakes. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

TEXT 8

lakṣmi-nṛsiṁha mama dehi karāvalambam //

The tree of saṁsāra, or material existence, is sprouted from the seed of sinful desire. The unlimited reactions to fruitive activities are it's branches, the senses are it's leaves and it's flowers is Cupid's at                                                  traction of sex desire. O merciful one, I climbed up this tree but I have only obtained the fruit of misery and am now fallen. O Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, please bless me with the touch of Your lotus hands.

Lord Narasiṁha has killed Indra's enemy Hiraṇyakaśipu with His sharpest nails which are equal to the 'vajra-yudha' (Indra's thunderbolt). His act is similar to a lion brutally killing an elephant.  Like many others, Lord Narasiṁha was not born out of any relationship of parents, but was born out of a pillar, so therefore He may be called ‘the son of the pillar”.  
Lord Narasiṁha will not excuse any enemies of Vaiṣṇavas or will He paradon them. He was very much pleased by the prayers of the small child Prahlāda, who is the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu and the Lord blessed him for his devotion.  Narasiṁha's, roaring sound is very pleasant to hear.  Lakṣmiī Devī prays to Narasiṁha continuously.  Others like Brahmā, Vāyu, Seṣa, Garuḍa, Rudra, Indra, Saṅumukha and other demigods pray to Him through their Lotus-like mouths, “ O  Narasiṁha please protect me.” (Daśāvatāra Stuti v.8)
